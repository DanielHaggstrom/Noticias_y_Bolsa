The Taubman family has agreed to sell a third of its ownership interest on the same terms.After the deal is completed Taubman, which operates 26 shopping centres in the US and Asia, will be 80 per cent-owned by Simon, with the Taubman family retaining a 20 per cent holding. Simon owns or has an interest in 235 malls and factory outlets in North America, Europe and Asia.The acquisition was announced as Simon closed in on a separate $80m deal to buy fast-fashion chain Forever 21 out of bankruptcy, an unusual transaction that shows how property companies are responding to turmoil in the retail sector.Simon is teaming up with Brookfield Property Partners, another real estate company, and BlackRock-controlled Authentic Brands, a licensing specialist that owns Sports Illustrated magazine, to buy the cheap chic retailer.A deadline for other bidders to come forward for Forever 21 came and went on Friday, paving the way for the consortium to seal the deal. Creditors have until Tuesday morning to file objections to the deal with a Delaware bankruptcy court. A sale hearing is scheduled for shortly after the deadline.Forever 21’s Chapter 11 filing last September was the latest in a series of blows to shopping malls grappling with a series of retail failures. David Simon, chief executive of Simon, said last week that the deal could help save “many” stores and jobs.The store chain is also major tenant of Taubman, according to its most recent annual report. The shopping centre owner had 17 Forever 21 stores in its portfolio as of the start of last year, accounting for 513,00 sq ft of space.“By joining together, we will enhance the ability of [Taubman] to invest in innovative retail environments that create exciting shopping and entertainment experiences for consumers, immersive opportunities for retailers, and substantial new job prospects for local communities,” Mr Simon said.Simon expects to fund the deal with $3.6bn in existing liquidity. The company said on a call that it was “significantly undervalued” and “has no desire to issue stock at this time”.The transaction, which is subject to customary conditions, is expected to close in the middle of the year.Shares in Taubman surged 53 per cent in morning trade. Simon gained 0.7 per cent.
1;SPG;Simon Property Group;2018-04-03T16:48:15Z;Brookfield’s US shopping mall deal should unnerve bulls;Acquisition of retail centre operator is latest twist in a fast-changing narrative;Shares in US mall operators have fallen sharply during the past two years as the narrative that online commerce will destroy bricks-and-mortar retailers becomes the stock market consensus.Not only have large numbers of mall tenants suffered sharp declines in like-for-like sales, the US arguably has too many such centres, boasting five times the number on a per capita basis than the UK and double that of Australia. Hedge funds sold short shares in US mall real estate investment trusts and made significant profits in doing so, with the Bloomberg Regional Mall index down 35 per cent since the middle of 2016.More recently, however, following sharp falls in the value of the largest operators with the highest-quality “class A” malls, such as Simon Property Group and GGP, the market narrative has switched to the risk that these companies have been oversold. Short interest in the shares of the two biggest US operators by value — a proxy for bearish bets against their shares — eased as hedge funds covered their positions and moved on to new ideas. Indeed, some sector analysts started to argue that “prime” US malls, such as those owned by Simon and GGP, were now undervalued as they were trading at meaningful discounts to estimates of the net value of their assets.That was until mall bulls were forced to ask some painful questions last week when news that Brookfield Property Partners was buying out the 66 per cent of GGP it did not own for a headline price of $23.50 a share — compared with a consensus estimate of its net asset value of $28 a share.Analysts at BTIG, who had a $27 price target on GGP’s shares, were outraged at what they saw as a take-under offer by Brookfield. “The offer is wholly inadequate and should be rejected by GGP shareholders,” they wrote.Does the fact that Brookfield has made what the market views as a low-ball offer mean it is getting a bargain, or does it in fact mean the estimated value for the best malls in the US was far too high in the first place? That GGP’s board has decided to accept a bid apparently so far below estimates of the value of its properties may mean the market must now sharply revalue down the value of other owners of commercial real estate.miles.johnson@ft.com
2;SPG;Simon Property Group;2017-08-03T03:00:54Z;Ecommerce isn’t all gloom for real estate investors;Warehouses near residential areas provide a bright spot for real estate investment trusts;While ecommerce has raised existential questions over shopping malls, it has proved a boon for money managers betting on rising demand for the warehouse space and distribution centres that are indispensable for the growth of online retailing.The FTSE NAREIT industrial index, which has 10 members led by Prologis, has rallied 13 per cent over the past year.“They have benefited from what is going on in the ecommerce space, but not just from the large well-known ecommerce providers, but many of brick and mortar retailers have been getting their own online strategy,” says Steve Buller, manager of the Fidelity real estate investment fund.Some of this real estate has scarcity value, depending on the location, because it can also be used in other ways, such as gyms and restaurants since they are close to populated residential areas.“Historically what has always brought the industrial cycle to an end is overbuilding, but the space that everybody wants is very hard to find,” says Sherry Rexroad, chair of the investment committee for the global real estate securities group at BlackRock, referring to the so-called “last mile” from a warehouse to a delivery spot.The performance of industrial reits has come despite the downward pressure on the wider real estate sector exerted by the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. That has prompted a rotation by investors out of stocks with bond-like properties.It has been another headwind for the FTSE Nareit Retail Property Index, which is down more than 20 per cent over the last year. “The sector return dispersion has been largest we have ever seen,” Mr Buller said of the divergence of retail and industrial Reits.Rising fears over the future of bricks and mortar retail has hurt areas of the financial markets exposed to it, but some analysts argue it is premature to write the obituaries for all of those reits focused on shopping malls.“It is bifurcated. In one camp are people who think all brick and mortar is dead and everything will shift online. The other sees pressure but that the better [Reit managers] will figure out how to adapt and make changes,” says Steve Sakwa, an analyst at Evercore who has buy recommendations on some retail Reits.“As property owners you can’t just snap your fingers and change stuff. There are leases — it takes time — sometimes more time than the markets have patience for.”Take Simon Property, a $51bn Indianapolis-based Reit whose shares have fallen by more than a quarter over the last 12 months. David Simon, its chief executive, told analysts on the company’s quarterly earnings call this week that it was lowering its exposure to clothing stores while that to restaurants was rising.At its Galleria shopping centre in Houston, Texas, for example, the upscale sushi restaurant Nobu is replacing a Saks Fifth Avenue department store, while an Outback Steakhouse will fill the space where a Sears once stood in a mall in King of Prussia, a suburb of Philadelphia. In a Nashville property, a Madame Tussauds wax museum will operate where a Barnes & Noble once operated.“I have two teenage daughters — not to generalise from unbelievably small sample size — but the younger generation, millennial generation is more interested in experiences and services versus accumulating stuff,” says Mr Buller. That is “not necessarily good for retail real estate.”Figures from CoStar may hint that efforts by mall operators are helping. Although stores closings this year in the US have nearly reached the total for all of 2016, the percentage of occupied space is still growing, says Suzanne Mulvee, CoStar’s retail strategist.“That suggests the space is getting filled,” she says. “The question is with what? Is the landlord happy? They may fill the space with someone who pays less.”Whatever a shopping mall owner tries, one major factor that will shape their fortunes remains out of their control and is one of the oldest truisms in real estate: location. Owning properties in places with certain demographics improves a Reit’s chance of being able to repurpose space after stores closings, sometimes to its benefit.“Take a mall in the suburbs of New York with high population density and high income and contrast it with a tertiary market in the midwest or south-east with lower income, lower housing values and less density of population — they will face far more competition not just from the internet but from the average Walmart,” says Ms Rexroad of BlackRock. “The benefit of owning A spaces and A locations is becoming ever more important.”The logic applies to the warehouse and distribution space that the march of e-commerce is putting a premium on, too.“Valuations are full, but growth rates there are supporting those valuations,” Ms Rexroad adds of industrial Reits. “The rally isn’t over, but it is certainly not a bargain.”

The broader market has risen 16.2 per cent over the past year.Investors have been fixated on a string of sales misses in recent days disclosed by the best-known US department stores, such as Macy’s, Kohl’s and JC Penney.Wall Street’s gloomy sentiment intensified on Tuesday, when TJX Cos, a discount retailer that has tended to buck the troubles of retailers, disclosed its weakest like-for-like sales growth since 2015, along with a disappointing outlook. Dick’s Sporting Goods, a speciality retailer, also posted a sales miss.In a sign of the rising jitters, shares in Simon Property Group, the biggest US mall operator, have slid 7 per cent since last Wednesday to $154.13.Meanwhile, the cost to insure Simon’s debt against default has ticked higher. Credit default swaps that are used by investors to hedge holdings of the company’s bonds were the worst performers on Tuesday in an index compiled by Markit that tracks such derivatives on investment-grade companies.The spread on Simon’s five-year CDS was 107.7 basis points on Tuesday, up from 94.5bp last Wednesday, Bloomberg data show. The group is rated in the single A range by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch.Despite the dim sentiment, however, Ross Smotrich, an analyst at Barclays, said this week that Simon’s management appeared to be doing a good job at dodging the retail industry’s troubles.“Given the current environment of increased store closures, we believe the stability underlying [Simon’s] operating metrics speaks to the company’s ability to effectively manage the industry’s current headwinds,” he said.Elsewhere, shares in Pfizer, the world’s largest standalone drugmaker, fell by 1.6 per cent to $32.60, after Citibank issued a scathing note warning that the group would miss profit forecasts in the absence of a large deal.Andrew Baum, the widely-followed Citi analyst, downgraded the pharmaceuticals group from “neutral” to “sell” and reduced its earnings estimates by between 5 and 10 per cent for the 2018-22 period.“Pfizer needs a deal to deliver consensus earnings per share,” Mr Baum wrote.Mr Baum said that Bristol-Myers Squibb and Allergan — which Pfizer tried and failed to buy last year — were the most likely targets, but warned that any deal carried a “major transaction risk” for the company.Looking at the broader market, the S&P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent to 2,400.7, having ticked up to a record intraday high earlier. The Nasdaq Composite edged up by 0.3 per cent to 6,169.9, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed at 20,979.8.Additional reporting by David Crow

Aeropostale operated more than 800 stores at the start of the year, primarily in the US, according to filings with US securities regulators.The group has already shuttered more than 100 stores.The company has launched cut rate sales to liquidate merchandise, and will likely keep 229 stores open, a person familiar with the deal said. Retailers across the US have struggled to reinvigorate sliding profits, as competition intensifies from fast fashion chains like H&M and Zara and athletic apparel outfitters such as Nike.
6;SPG;Simon Property Group;2016-01-29T21:24:22Z;Strong dollar takes bite out of Colgate;Broader US markets close poor month on brighter note;The strong dollar has taken the bite out of Colgate’s sales, pushing the toothpaste maker into its first quarterly loss in at least 10 years.The New-York based company saw net sales slip 7.5 per cent to $3.9bn during the fourth quarter of 2015. Better sales volume and higher pricing had helped Colgate-Palmolive deliver a 5 per cent jump in organic sales during the period.Currency headwinds however, knocked 11.5 percentage points off sales, wiping out these gains. That, along with a $1.1bn writedown on its business in Venezuela, pushed Colgate into a $458m loss, compared with a profit of $628m in the same quarter in 2014.Colgate generates two-thirds of its revenues from outside North America, and the dollar’s appreciation against a number of major developed and emerging market currencies has sharply eroded the value of its sales in those countries.“Macroeconomic conditions and foreign exchange volatility remain challenging,” said Ian Cook, chief executive. Based on current exchange rates Colgate expects a “low single-digit earnings per share decline” this year, he added.Shares in Colgate, which are up 0.6 per cent over the past 12 months, gained 3.9 per cent by the close of trading.Elsewhere, the latest instalment of Star Wars wasn’t enough to save Electronic Arts, one of the world’s biggest video game makers, from disappointing Wall Street on Friday. Although the company, which is headquartered in Redwood City, California, said that sales for its Star Wars game beat its own forecasts, the shares slid after its outlook for the current quarter fell short of estimates.Electronic Arts predicted earnings per share, with one-time items stripped out, of 40 cents a share, compared with the 50 cents expected by analysts, according to a survey by Bloomberg. The shares declined 7.5 per cent to $64.54.Simon Property reported weaker than expected results for the fourth quarter, mired by slowing growth in tenant sales for the biggest listed real estate company in the US.Funds from operations, the most widely used profitability metric for real estate investment trusts, fell to $867m, or $2.40 a share, compared with $897m, or $2.47 a share, for the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected $2.44 a share.Simon, the biggest American mall owner by every measure, has rejigged its portfolio in the past few years, shedding smaller, less-profitable shopping centres for big malls and outlets, and thereby boosting its occupancy rates.Tenant sales for Simon’s US malls nudged up to $620 per square foot for the quarter, from $619 per square foot a year ago, but occupancy rates slipped to 96.1 per cent, from 97.1 per cent a year ago.Simon’s shares have fallen 4.3 per cent this year, along with other real estate investment trusts which have been dented by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate rise and broader market anxiety.Shares in Amazon continued to suffer on Friday, after the world’s largest online retailer released weak results late on Thursday. Shares in Amazon fell 7.6 per cent, although the stock is still up 88 per cent over the past 12 months.US stocks ended the week on a cheerful note after a grim January, lifted by a fresh round of easing from the Bank of Japan that boosted sentiment for equities across the globe.By the close of markets in New York, the S&P 500 gained 2.5 per cent to 1,940.24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.5 per cent to 16,466.30 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.4 per cent to 4,613.95.
7;SPG;Simon Property Group;2015-04-14T08:58:06Z;US companies unleash share buyback binge;Shareholders on track for $1tn in cash returns this year;An ageing US equity bull run retains one major source of buyers these days — the large companies that dominate the share market including Apple, Intel, IBM and now General Electric.No matter the muted interest on the part of US investors, companies are increasingly upping their purchasing power, helping maintain a bull market run that over the past six years has left equities looking richly priced.Buybacks have been a popular way to boost shareholder value for several decades and help companies offset equity options granted to employees. But in the current environment of sluggish economic growth, the rising tide of buybacks and dividends being paid out worries some observers, as it suggests corporations are less optimistic about future prospects and see a paucity of long-term investment opportunities.Strategists have debated the degree to which buybacks have accelerated the current bull run, with several noting the downturn in Europe would have probably pushed sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and other institutional investors into US stocks.“It’s not a zero sum game and it doesn’t have to be,” says David Lefkowitz, an equity strategist with UBS Wealth Management. “The flows are not necessarily indicative of how much support corporate buybacks are lending to the bull market. If that goes away, I wouldn’t necessarily be concerned about a downside in equities.”With investors expecting a big reduction in quarterly earnings growth compared with a year ago, the return of cash shows no sign of abating, with GE announcing last week it would return a massive $90bn over the next three years.Now the market stands on the cusp of seeing a record of more than $1tn returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases this year — with this activity supporting equity prices and valuations as the benchmark index hovers less than 1 per cent from a record high.Qualcomm, Lowes, General Motors and Simon Property have initiated or authorised multibillion-dollar increases to share buyback programmes in the past two months, while the financial sector cleared a key hurdle in early March when the Federal Reserve gave a green light to dividend increases and repurchase plans from the country’s largest banks. Citigroup, American Express and JPMorgan led a group of nearly two dozen financials that committed as much as $50bn to buybacks over the next five quarters.Attention has now shifted to Apple, the exemplar of share repurchases, which is expected to announce changes to its multiyear $130bn programme in late April. Those repurchases are “crucial” to valuations and earnings growth, Orrin Sharp-Pierson of BNP Paribas says, a point echoed by Goldman Sachs.“There is still a very clear preference to receive buybacks as an investor. You get this sense of perpetual synthetic growth, which investors appreciate in the presence of little underlying growth,” he says. “And you get a boost to secondary demand — the stock effect creating the additional bid for equities has been really quite important.”Retail investors have been absent from buying US equities, joining institutions looking to Europe and Asia for growth opportunities. Investors have pulled $18bn from exchange traded funds invested in US stocks since the year began, compared with $11bn that has flowed to ETFs investing in European and Asian equities, according to data provider Markit.Tobias Levkovich, a strategist with Citi, notes that over the past decade, S&P 500 companies have repurchased $4tn worth of shares — in part to offset stock options offered to employees — while domestic investors have added less than $100bn to the mix.“The lack of US retail investor interest in stocks has been stunning and equity market tops usually consist of overly aggressive individual investor interest in the asset class,” says Mr Levkovich.The pace of companies buying back their own shares now accounts for more than 2 per cent of overall equity volumes in the US and contributed 2.3 per cent to earnings growth for the S&P 500 last year, according to strategists with JPMorgan. That figure, the brokerage says, will probably accelerate this year as a slide in the dollar and oil cut into earnings gains from underlying operations.The returns have made valuations more palatable for the S&P 500 — the index trades at 17.8 times 2015 expected earnings, above its 10-year average — as analysts ready for two quarters of earnings declines. Companies on the US blue-chip index offer a dividend yield of 2 per cent, just above the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury.US multinationals steadily increasing returns to shareholders have in turn found stronger buyer interest. Both the S&P 500 buyback and S&P 500 dividend aristocrats indices have outperformed their namesake over the past 12 months, with the former outpacing the broader blue-chip index by nearly 650 basis points.“With rates expected to remain low, search for yield to continue, and a cautious investor base, shareholder-friendly companies with attractive total yields and strong cash flow generation should benefit from the current market environment,” says Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, a strategist with JPMorgan.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
8;SPG;Simon Property Group;2015-04-01T16:23:30Z;Macerich shares dip as Simon Property pulls $23bn bid;US shopping mall wars on hold as takeover battle ends;The US shopping mall wars have halted for now.Shares in Macerich slipped nearly 7 per cent on Wednesday after the mall operator rejected a $23bn sweetened offer from larger rival Simon Property, which launched a hostile takeover last month.Macerich, whose shares had surged 37 per cent to $96 since Simon first showed interest, closed at $78.73 per share.Simon’s $95.50 per share offer, which valued Macerich at $23.2bn including $6.4bn in debt, “substantially undervalued” the company and did not reflect efforts to restructure its portfolio around high-end malls, Macerich said.Simon swiftly withdrew its offer because Macerich chose “not to engage in discussions” with Simon.The rejection was largely expected by analysts, although a delayed response from Macerich sparked speculation that the company could surprise.Macerich rejected the bid late on Tuesday night, 11 days after Simon made its “best and final offer” on March 20 and one day before its April 1 expiry.Macerich’s shares may trade in the mid-$70s going forward, analysts said.While the rejection was expected, it was “difficult to understand” why Macerich did not offer to engage or seek alternatives and the “outright” rejection will not sit well with investors, wrote Nathan Isbee, analyst at Stifel.Simon, the largest US mall owner by every measure, had sought to buy Macerich to capture more of the high-end mall market.Luxury malls in America are thriving while many second-tier properties are being shut or repurposed. The uneven economic recovery has favoured luxury retailers.Asset values of high-end malls have nearly doubled since 2007, while the values of lower tier “C” and “D” malls have declined, according to Green Street Advisors, a property consultancy.Macerich has rejigged its portfolio around higher-end properties, shedding lower quality malls and investing fresh capital in premium properties.While Macerich is just a quarter of Simon’s size in enterprise value and rental income, its premium model saw the company book more than $1bn in pre-tax profit last year.The company’s strategy will position itself as a “pure-play high-end mall Reit”, Arthur Coppolla, Macerich chief executive, said.Based on expected future growth, Macerich “faces a disconnect between private market valuations and public market views,” Mr Coppolla said.After Simon’s first unsolicited offer in March, Macerich had made governance changes to protect the company from a hostile bid, including a so-called poison pill giving shareholders rights to buy shares at a discount, a sign of its intention to remain independent.Simon’s shares rose 1.2 per cent on Wednesday. S&P Capital analysts raised their target price for Simon to $218, saying that they “applaud” Simon’s decision to scrap the bid and that Macerich “needs to better articulate” its decision to stay independent.
9;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Simon raises bid for rival mall operator;Offer of $95.50 per share for Macerich is ‘final’;Simon Property, the largest US shopping mall operator, sweetened its hostile takeover bid for smaller rival Macerich to $95.50 per share in cash and stock, up from its previous offer of $91.This “best and final offer” will be withdrawn on April 1 if the companies do not meet to discuss the deal, Simon said. The new bid would value Macerich at $23.2bn, including $6.4bn in debt.Although the offer represents a 37 per cent premium to Macerich’s undisturbed share price, the target’s stock slid nearly 7 per cent to $87.19 in early trading as traders deemed the new offer insufficient to seal the deal.Macerich said it would review the proposal and asked shareholders to take no immediate action.Macerich rejected Simon’s initial offer earlier this week, saying the bid “substantially undervalues” the company and did not capture its efforts to restructure its portfolio, shedding lower quality malls and investing fresh capital in new premium properties.Macerich also made governance changes to protect the company from a hostile bid, making it tougher for Simon to force a decision.“Macerich’s decision to adopt extreme defensive measures is disappointing,” said David Simon, Simon’s chairman and chief executive, adding that a “protracted, multiyear proxy battle” was not in the interests of shareholders.Simon also said it would not nominate a new director to Macerich’s board in a friendly move that aims to decrease tension between the two companies’ management.People close to Macerich said the board of the Santa Monica-based company would welcome Simon’s decision to withdraw the threat of a proxy fight over the nomination of board members and would take the new offer more seriously.But despite the sweeter offer and friendlier approach, one person involved in the negotiation said it was still very unlikely that Macerich would accept the higher bid as several substantial legal problems remained.Maryland law prohibits companies from doing a deal with a shareholder who controls — directly or indirectly — more than 10 per cent of the target company.Currently, Simon directly owns 3.6 per cent of Macerich but it also has an indirect control of its rival through Vanguard, which owns 13 per cent of Macerich. Simon is confident that this would not be a problem but Macerich is of a different view.Some analysts said Simon’s new offer was not high enough to make Macerich change its mind.“It’s likely Macerich won’t review any material bids unless they come in at a significant premium,” said David Auerbach, a Reit trader at Esposito Securities. “I am not sure a 5 per cent price increase is a material move. General consensus is they’re just going to walk away.”

Asset values of high-end malls have nearly doubled since 2007, while the value of lower tier “C” and “D” malls has declined, says Green Street Advisors, a real estate consultancy.While Macerich is just a quarter of Simon’s size in enterprise value and rental income, its premium model saw the company book more than $1bn in pre-tax profit last year.David Auerbach, a Reit trader at Esposito Securities, said: “They did a good job cleaning up their balance sheet and portfolio with the intention of selling the company, so it seems they’re sitting on their hands to see what Simon comes back with or a rival bid.”The merger makes sense strategically because there’s little geographic overlap between the two mall portfolios, said Green Street analyst Daniel Busch in a note. He projected a takeout price of about $95 a share, saying Simon would probably have to “slightly sweeten its initial offer to cross the finish line”.The uneven US economic recovery has favoured luxury brands and the malls they reside in, while middle-class retailers such as JC Penney and Sears have been shutting down stores, dragging down lower-end mall productivity.Macerich said 85 per cent of its 2014 operating income derived from what it called “super zip codes”, where the median household income hovered around $120,000 and more than two-thirds of adults had a university degree.
11;SPG;Simon Property Group;2015-03-16T11:52:11Z;Luxury malls ride out changing US shopping habits;Grittier complexes struggle as lower-income shoppers stay away or prefer to purchase online;Sometimes, Kevin does not see a single person for three hours straight.So, when a customer walks into the Michael Kors store in the Westchester Mall, tucked in a wealthy suburb 30 miles north of New York City, the young sales worker dashes up excitedly to greet her.The store has made more money than last year, he says, but the number of visitors to the mall has dropped since he began working there two years ago.“There’s just a lot fewer people walking through,” Kevin says. “It’s quiet here, mostly Westchester housewives or private school girls who come after school, and it definitely feels less busy than a few years ago.”The rise of online shopping, combined with a lacklustre US economy, has hit the great American mall hard. Once a staple of American culture in the 1980s and 1990s, retail foot traffic during the November-December holiday season halved from nearly 35bn in 2010 to 17.6bn in 2013, according to ShopperTrak.But look behind the headline numbers, and it becomes clear that not all malls are equal. Since 2007, the asset value of luxury, or so-called “A+” malls like the Westchester, has nearly doubled. The values of lower-tier “C” and “D” malls were slightly negative, according to Green Street Advisors, a real estate consultancy.This divergence explains US mall ownerSimon Property’s hostile $22.4bn bid for Macerich, a smaller rival, last week.Although it is just a quarter of Simon’s size in both enterprise value and rental income, Macerich has restructured itself around luxury malls by selling off underperforming property — and booking more than $1bn in pre-tax profit last year in the process.Macerich said it made 85 per cent of its 2014 operating income from what it calls “super zip codes” — where the median household income hovers around $120,000 and more than two-thirds of adults have a university degree. This is up from 66 per cent three years earlier.When we do well, we do really wellSimon’s bid is a “battle to own the best, most high-end malls in the country”, says David Auerbach, a Reit trader at Esposito Securities.Macerich, which did not respond to requests for comment, has said it would review what it described as an “unsolicited, conditional” proposal from Simon, which is at a 30 per cent premium to Macerich’s undisturbed share price.The imperative of owning luxury properties is apparent at the Galleria, a “C” ranked mall less than a kilometre from the Westchester.The dimly lit, gritty complex, anchored by Sears and Old Navy, stands in stark contrast to the carpeted, shiny corridors of its posh rival.A square foot of retail space at the Galleria generates just $310 a year, compared with $1,085 at the Westchester Mall. Employees at American Eagle, Old Navy and Aéropostale say the mall is less busy than a year ago and shoppers seem to spend less money.15%Number of US malls expected to fail or be converted to non-retail in the next decadeAcross the US, “C” and “D” malls make up about a third of the some 1,100 malls by number, but only 5 per cent by value. In the next decade, some 15 per cent of US malls will fail or be converted to non-retail property, according to Green Street Advisors, most of which would be lower-tier malls.Much of this divergence is due to rising US income inequality, which has “affected everything in malls”, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, an investment bank.Luxury and lower-tier malls are hurt by online shopping in different ways.“Luxury malls are golden, but the question is, where does the middle class shop? Cheaper alternatives, Walmart, TJMaxx and online deals, they’re off the mall,” he says.The Westchester, for example, is home to jewellery and accessories stores such as Tiffany, Louis Vuitton and Dooney & Bourke. People buying an expensive watch, for example, are more likely to want to visit the store and see the product, says Simeon Siegel, research director at Nomura.For the teen clothing brands at the Galleria such as Aéropostale and Old Navy, by contrast, there is much less reason not to shop online.Wealthy Americans are also simply spending more as the economy recovers. Same-store sales at luxury brands — including Michael Kors — have grown by double digits in the past few years.Abercrombie & Fitch’s US same-store sales fell 10 per cent for the November through January period, while Aéropostale’s dropped 9 per cent. Same-store sales at traditional “mall stores” such as Express and Ann Taylor have declined for three consecutive quarters.For stores like Michael Kors, strong demand from the wealthy will probably shield it from the threat of ecommerce and drop in overall traffic, say analysts.“I don’t know why it is [that fewer people are visiting the mall],” Kevin says. “But don’t get me wrong — when we do well, we do really well.”
12;SPG;Simon Property Group;2015-03-13T23:11:00Z;American malls: shopping spree;Simon investors may worry about the high price of Macerich;"America likes its malls big. At the Mall of America, in Minnesota, it would take three sleepless days to visit each store for 10 minutes. Mall owners like to go big too. Simon Property, the biggest owner of retail real estate in North America, has offered $91 a share to buy the second-largest, Macerich. The deal would create a company with an enterprise value of nearly $100bn. That’s America big.Whether the size justifies the bride price is another question. Simon is paying a 30 per cent premium to Macerich’s undisturbed price; this, in turn, is a 20 per cent premium to Macerich’s net asset value, according to Green Street Advisors. That is a $3.2bn premium — why pay so much?The conventional answer is cost savings. If Simon can eliminate three-quarters of Macerich’s overhead costs, this would save $50m a year, Green Street says (which works out to perhaps $850m in capitalised value). Simon can also refinance Macerich’s $6bn debt at a lower cost — a further $400m of capitalised value.Shaving off costs will not be easy. Simon and Macerich are already large operators, so additional economies of scale are few. Perhaps Simon will shave off some less efficient properties in its deal to sell some Macerich assets to General Growth Properties.But there is another potential benefit — a higher valuation. Simon’s rate of return over its enterprise value (or cap rate, in the jargon) is 5.5 per cent. Macerich’s is 4.2 per cent, according to Credit Suisse: the market values its profits more highly. If Simon can capture some of that sparkle, that could create additional value.The board of Macerich has not yet responded to the offer. Its shareholders are likely to see much in it to like. Analysts believe it could be sweetened to as much as $95. This would be hard to resist for Macerich; Simon’s shareholders may be worried about paying a premium at the top of the market.

13;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;A $22.4bn bet that fast times lie ahead for the mall;Reviving US retail means offering experiences people cannot find online;In the stereotypic 1980s Hollywood film about American suburban life, the action invariably takes place at the local mall. It’s where the young people hang out, interact and find cool clothes for parties and what passes for purpose in life in such cinematic contexts.But the times, they are a-changin’. The kids in America don’t go to the malls as frequently as they used to because they would rather do their ogling, flirting and buying online.Meanwhile, growing income inequality has led to a bifurcation of American retailing — with traffic migrating away from many of the traditional anchor tenants of the malls to specialists focusing on either the higher and lower ends of the market.The world that Sean Penn and Phoebe Cates knew in Fast Times at Ridgemont High is dead and gone — and that’s what makes Simon Property’s $91-a-share hostile bid on Monday for rival mall owner Macerich so intriguing. If the target’s debt is included in the deal, it would have a value of $22.4bn.Combining Simon, the top US mall owner, with Macerich, the third largest, would give the resulting company greater ability to deal with the pressures ahead, if only by increasing its bargaining power with tenants, said Ryan Severino, senior economist at Reis, a commercial real estate research firm.But it also would amount to an implicit bet that the US mall is still where the action is — albeit of the sort more familiar to students of Joseph Schumpeter’s theories of creative destruction than to fans of coming-of-age movies.The idea floating around the retail trade is that better-quality shopping centres in the middle of towns can be remade into places approximating the old town squares that existed in the US before the rise of the “mall rat”.In addition to shopping, these properties will offer experiences that people cannot obtain online — dining, workout facilities, massages and medical care.In an interview late last year with TheStreet.com, David Simon, chief executive of Simon Property, called the mall business “vibrant” and expressed optimism about its future. The key, he suggested, would be improving the customer experience “through better amenities, a better merchandise mix . . . and creating food halls and dining pavilions.”“In some cases, it’s as simple as bringing the mall into the 21st century because it’s dated and needs to be refreshed, bringing in technology, WiFi, loyalty programmes,” he said. “The ability to talk to the consumer as they walk the mall about brands and what’s being promoted is a focus.”There is an element of reinventing the wheel in the strategy — bringing back the kind of experiences Americans enjoyed on the Main Street of days gone by. But then again, wheels work however they come into being.
14;SPG;Simon Property Group;2015-03-09T16:07:39Z;Simon in $22.4bn hostile bid for Macerich;Cash and stock offer would combine two of the three largest US shopping mall operators;Simon Property has launched a hostile bid to acquire its rival Macerich in a $22.4bn deal that would combine two of the US’s three largest shopping mall operators.The Indianapolis-based company offered Macerich shareholders $91 per share in a cash-and-stock transaction. The headline value of the offer includes the assumption of $6.4bn of outstanding debt.The offer represents a 30 per cent premium to Macerich’s closing stock price on November 18, the day before Simon disclosed its 3.6 per cent investment in the company.Macerich urged its shareholders to take no action, saying that its board would review what it described as an “unsolicited, conditional” proposal from Simon.Macerich shares climbed 6.1 per cent to $92 in early afternoon trading in New York, above Simon’s $91 offer. Macerich shares closed at $92.76.Simon said on Monday that it had approached its rival several times with a series of offers that had been repeatedly rebuffed.“Notwithstanding multiple attempts, including meetings in December 2014 and February 2015 following the disclosure of our investment in November 2014, Macerich has thus far refused to engage in discussions with us regarding the merits of an acquisition by Simon,” said David Simon, chairman and chief executive.“We are confident our proposed transaction provides a highly attractive value proposition to Macerich shareholders . . . Considering the substantial benefits our offer provides, we are confident that, given the opportunity, Macerich’s shareholders would accept our proposal,” said Mr Simon.Taking over Macerich, however, could be tough for Simon as the target is registered as a real estate investment trust in Maryland, which has state laws that protect companies from unsolicited bids.Simon’s bid comes as gloom hangs over the US mall industry, although analysts say there is a clear divide between luxury locations and the traditional middle-class mall.“Some higher-end companies entering malls are doing phenomenally well, and there’s strong growth in outlets, while B and C locations are showing more of a struggle,” said Simeon Siegel, research director at Nomura.Middle-class Americans are opening their pockets again as the US economy recovers from the financial crisis, but they are increasingly shopping online or at discounters such as Walmart or TJMaxx, which are usually outside of shopping malls.Notwithstanding multiple attempts . . . Macerich has thus far refused to engage in discussions with us regarding the merits of an acquisitionMeanwhile, luxury malls and outlet locations — where designer brands sell stock at cheaper rates — are thriving, an expression of the unequal nature of the US economic recovery.Simon, the largest US shopping mall owner, owns about 15 per cent of US malls and half of the country’s outlet stores. A quarter of its revenues come from its discount outlets.The takeover would give Simon more leverage in negotiating with tenants, add to its portfolio of outlets and give it a stronger presence in California and Arizona, where Macerich holds a strong foothold, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associations, a retail consulting and investment banking company.Half the middle-class malls will fail or be converted to alternative uses within 20 years, he predicts.BofA Merrill Lynch is acting as financial adviser to Simon, and Latham & Watkins LLP is acting as legal counsel to Simon in connection with the proposed transaction.
15;SPG;Simon Property Group;2014-11-21T16:35:21Z;Chart that tells a story – Reits;Specialist property owners outperform bigger generalists;What does this show?The commercial property market is booming once again. But not all commercial property stocks are equal. Some are outperforming others. The key is specialisation. Landlords who specialise in a particular corner of the market – whether it is student housing (Unite), storage space (Big Yellow) or tech start-ups (Workspace) have done better than the big-name generalists over the past couple of years.Why is that?As investors worldwide engage in a desperate search for assets which generate a decent yield, real estate has become more of a mainstream asset class. Ever-increasing numbers of professional investors are piling in. Large-scale asset managers like to make their own calls about what to back. Britain’s biggest listed property companies hold too broad and diversified a range of assets, whereas smaller specialists, which are exposed to the fastest-growing sectors of the economy, offer the best returns.Why don’t the big guys specialise too?Most of the biggest landlords are shedding what they call “non-core” assets to focus their portfolios on one or two areas. Land Securities, for example, is selling many of its shopping centres to focus on only the biggest retail destinations, as well as its portfolio of high-quality London offices such as the newly-built Walkie Talkie. And in 2012 Hammerson shed its portfolio of London offices and decided to focus on retail property.So how come have their shares underperformed?It is the price they pay for being big in a country that’s relatively small. With a £13.2bn portfolio, Land Securities is the country’s largest real estate investment trust. Britain simply doesn’t have enough commercial property for it to invest all of its cash in one subsector of the market.By contrast, US Reits have both scale and specialism. One of the biggest, Simon Property Group, which specialises in shopping malls, has assets of $33bn. That is the benefit of operating in a country of 317m people, rather than 64m.That brings us back to the specialists. What is so good about them?The companies whose shares are most in demand by investors focus on novel or previously unregarded parts of the property market. They generally also have a direct connection with a specific economic or business trend. Student housing and tech start-up offices both feed on industries which are booming in Britain – universities and London’s Silicon Roundabout. Self-storage is doing well because the housing market is on the up – and when more people move, there is more demand for storage space.Are there any other specialists worth looking at?The biggest darling of the current property cycle is Derwent London. Like Workspace, it benefits from London’s tech economy, though it focuses on larger businesses rather than start-ups and also houses many creative industries. It recently won PR firm Freud Communications as a tenant, for example. Many of its buildings are in London’s hip eastern fringe around Shoreditch.West End office specialist Great Portland Estates has also been doing very well, benefiting from roaring occupier demand and lack of availability of space in the area.
16;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Klépierre-Corio brings US-style consolidation to European malls;;If European shoppers want to see what the future holds for their favourite mall, they should look to Indianapolis.The US city is the home of Simon Property Group, the biggest US shopping mall operator by any measure, and now Simon is shaping the European market too.The acquisition of Netherlands-based Corio by retail landlord Klépierre will create Europe’s second-largest listed property company and could trigger a wave of consolidation, according to advisers and analysts who know the sector.Simon is Klépierre’s largest investor and its chairman and chief executive David Simon is also the French company’s chairman.Simon drove a two-decade-long period of consolidation in the US to become the dominant player. The merger of Europe’s second and third-largest listed retail landlords means that Mr Simon has made a move to do the same thing in Europe.Europe’s listed real estate market has long been regarded by major international investors as too fragmented, with a myriad different national regulatory and listing regimes making pan-European property ownership frustratingly difficult.“David Simon played the US consolidation brilliantly and is a top-quality dealmaker with a strong track record,” said John Lutzius, international managing director of Green Street Advisors. “The [Klépierre-Corio] merger makes sense as the European shopping centre [sector] evolves and consolidates. In this respect, the industry is following the pattern set over the past 15 years in the US.”The Klépierre-Corio deal was driven by major investors who wanted to hold stakes in a larger company, according to those with knowledge of the sector. It could be the first of many, they forecast.“The deal confirms our view that corporate activity and consolidation are likely to continue in European real estate,” said Valerie Guezi, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas Research. “For continental companies such as [market leader] Unibail-Rodamco, we believe that the UK seems like a good place to expand.”She singled out FTSE 100 landlord Intu as “the clearest way to build scale in the market, although shareholders have shown resistance”. Intu is backed by Peel Holdings, a private company owned by publicity-shy billionaire John Whittaker.Hammerson, also an FTSE 100 company, “offers less concentrated exposure but without the obstacles in the shareholder base”, Ms Guezi said.
17;SPG;Simon Property Group;2014-07-01T18:31:08Z;Klépierre sells five Swedish shopping centres in €354m deal;Funds raised to pay for planned development projects;Klépierre has sold five Swedish shopping centres to Olav Thon, Norway’s largest private property owner, for €354m as part of an “asset rotation strategy to enhance” its overall portfolio.The French retail mall developer will use the funds raised to pay for planned development projects in Norway, Sweden and Denmark.Klépierre’s growth strategy is based on demographics, using population projections to identify local areas where the economy can be expected to grow.The five centres were majority-owned by Klépierre subsidiary Steen & Strom, a specialist in Scandinavian retail malls.Last year Klépierre sold 127 shopping centre sites to French retail giant Carrefour for €2bn, 12 years after Klépierre bought the properties from the supermarket chain.Klépierre, whose biggest shareholder is the world’s largest shopping centre developer Simon Property Group, has a total portfolio of €14.1bn covering 13 European countries.Mr Thon’s Thon Retail Properties AB, part of the Olav Thon Group, bought the five centres. Thon owns 450 properties, including 60 hotels.
18;SPG;Simon Property Group;2013-10-25T14:15:04Z;US malls pursue tourist spending;;Simon Property Group, the largest US shopping mall owner by every measure, is seeking to woo more of the foreign tourists who are traversing the globe in search of discount fashion.The Indianapolis-based company’s premium outlets – where designer brands sell stock at cheaper rates – have been so popular with foreign bargain hunters that Simon is renovating, expanding and developing new properties to boost growth. Installing luggage shops and boosting storage facilities have been part of a strategy to keep tourists splurging.“Overseas visitors are looking for items at better prices than they’d get at home. They’ll often come with a long list of luxury goods and electronic items,” said Nicole Domer, regional vice-president of marketing for Simon. “They’ll start the day off with an empty suitcase and fill it with things they want for themselves and gifts for their families. We wanted to make hands-free shopping easier.”Domestic consumption has been patchy this year as Americans spent more on big-ticket items such as cars and household appliances than on clothes, apparel and other products sold at malls. But the numbers of deep-pocketed foreign visitors have risen as has their spending on items such as Apple iPhones, Michael Kors handbags and Tag Heuer watches.International visitors to the US spent $87.1bn in the first half of 2013 on shopping, lodging, recreation and airfare among other tourism-related goods and services – a 7 per cent increase from a year ago. Holidaymakers from China, Mexico and Brazil that are propelling sales at Simon’s malls are expected to account for almost 40 per cent of visitor growth in the next five years.The company on Friday reported a 12 per cent gain in third-quarter funds from operations – which gauges a property company’s ability to generate cash – and raised its full year FFO forecast as retailers sought more outlet space. Revenue increased about 6 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Despite low vacancy rates and little new construction – suggesting mall owners are in an enviable position – “the recent lacklustre operating performance by underlying retailers raises a yellow flag”, said Cedrik Lachance, analyst at Green Street Advisors, ahead of the earnings. This is one factor leading even successful operators to push their tourism strategies.Simon has created appropriate language signage, added currency exchange outposts and hired multilingual staff for its malls. An aggressive international marketing effort, incentives for foreign travel agencies, ties with domestic tour bus operators, airlines as well as credit card companies have also been part of the company’s plan to lure overseas shoppers across continents and into its malls.Simon owns around 15 per cent of US malls and 50 per cent of the country’s suburban outlets. A quarter of its revenues are generated in its discount shopping centres, analysts say. Tourists are driving more than half of sales at Simon’s outlets on the outskirts of gateway cities such as New York, and in Florida and California.Overseas visitors start the day off with an empty suitcase and fill it with things they want for themselves and gifts for their families. We wanted to make hands-free shopping easierBut Simon has greater ambitions. Although most operators have remained within US borders or have retreated after unsuccessfully investing abroad, Simon is seeking to expand its shopping mall portfolio into Europe, Latin America and Asia.The company has stepped up its direct outreach to travellers, particularly as they become more sophisticated at scouring the internet for the best deals. “These shoppers will meticulously plan visits to coincide with the holiday shopping season,” said Linda Humphers, editor-in-chief of Value Retail News. “By the time they arrive they know what to buy, where and when.”Among other operators, Glimcher Realty Trust’s Jersey Garden shopping centre has benefited from international travellers to New York, while Macerich’s outlet in Niagara Falls targets Canadian shoppers from across the border.
19;SPG;Simon Property Group;2012-03-09T20:34:16Z;Real estate sector still faces challenges;;It has been a good week to be a landlord.Real estate was the week’s best performing FTSE industry group, with the sector hitting its highest level since October. The catalyst came from France, where US mall developer Simon Property paid $2bn for a controlling stake in Klépierre, the owner of nearly 300 shopping centres and offices across Europe.Though Simon paid a near 20 per cent premium for the Klépierre shares, its price was still around 11 per cent below the group’s last published net asset value. The news helped boost sector peers, which trade on an average discount to net asset value of around 19 per cent.If investors do not take advantage of the discount, predators will, says JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Harm Meijer: “European property companies remain undervalued in our view and M&A is needed to close this valuation gap.”JPMorgan has picked shopping centre owners as the most likely to re-rate. Given the outlook for their tenants, this may seem counter-intuitive. UK retail insolvencies rose 27 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of 2011, according to Deloitte, which sees little improvement in 2012.Yet earnings for the landlords have so far proved resilient. Results season for the sector last month showed that, while capital values had stalled, vacancy rates were still declining and rental income edged higher.Lessons may have been learnt from the decline of five years ago, says Exane BNP Paribas analyst Nick Webb. “While the outlook for the UK commercial real estate sector is unexciting in the near term, it is also far from disastrous,” he says.“The UK real estate stocks, in general, have insulated themselves from the potentially painful implications of a deteriorated operating environment by maintaining conservative leverage, long-dated financing, avoiding large speculative development schemes and underwriting projects on the basis of cautious rent and yield assumptions.”The contrast to the credit crunch is striking. Then, the threat of disappearing credit lines, pulled projects and rescue rights issues caused UK property stocks to decline 80 per cent in the two years to March 2009.The fears may have abated, but how much has changed since 2009 is open to question. Deleveraging has been much slower than many expected, with around €30bn of European commercial mortgage-backed securities still due to expire over the next two years.Some analysts argue that the real estate companies were effectively bailed out by “quantitative easing”, which boosted the value of real assets by increasing the money supply and stoking inflation expectations.Having been in a “state of paralysis” since 2007, some managements are only now taking a serious approach to cutting debt, says Merrill Lynch analyst Bernd Stahli.“Too many listed property companies over the past decade plastered over the cracks of their weak internal growth dynamics with leverage,” he says. “Some of the managements only did the bare minimum or did nothing and were helped by the bounce in markets – largely pinning their hopes on the return of economic growth to heal naturally their company ills. Hope is not really a strategy.”Hope has so far proved sufficient for investors. None of the major UK real estate developers has cut its dividend, issued equity or sold assets at a sharp discount over the past year.Having been quicker to shore up their balance sheets than European peers, they have been able to take a more patient approach to restructuring. Hammerson said last month that it would sell its London offices, while Segro indicated a shifting focus from warehouses to logistics.Such modest asset sales might not be enough if economic growth falters. The outlook for debt financing remains highly uncertain, as is the outlook for further central bank stimulus, while most analysts expect property capital values to remain flat at best this year. The process of reducing indebtedness could yet fall to shareholders.
20;SPG;Simon Property Group;2012-03-08T20:51:56Z;BNP Paribas sells half its Klépierre stake;;BNP Paribas has sold half its stake in Klépierre, one of Europe’s largest shopping centre operators by sales, to US-based Simon Property Group, as part of its plan to strengthen its balance sheet.Simon Property has agreed to buy the 28.7 per cent stake for €1.52bn, or €28 a share, representing a premium of 20 per cent to Wednesday’s closing price.BNP said it had made a €1.5bn capital gain on the sale and had committed to holding its remaining 22.2 per cent stake for at least a year. It would not comment on whether it intended to sell its remaining stake, which analysts regard as a non-core asset.France’s biggest listed bank by assets said the sale moved it closer to its aim of achieving a tier one capital ratio – a key measure of balance sheet strength – of 9 per cent under the new Basel III regulatory rules, by 2013.Commercial property businesses attract a relatively high capital charge because they are regarded as risky under the new rules. BNP said the sale would contribute 0.32 percentage points to the 9 per cent target, leaving it with another 0.31 points to go.European banks are shedding assets and conserving capital to adapt to the new rules. Last month BNP sold $9.5bn of energy loans to Wells Fargo. The lender says it has been seeking to shed dollar-denominated assets following the withdrawal of investment by US money market funds in European banks last year. It has also sold corporate loan books.Analysts said that the bank should also consider selling down its 5 per cent stake in Axa, the French insurer, regarded as another non-core business which attracts a disproportionately high risk weighting.Before the Klépierre and energy portfolio sales, it had achieved €25bn of its plan to reduce risk-weighted assets by €79bn.David Simon, executive chairman of Simon Property Group, said its stake in Klépierre was “an attractive opportunity for SPG as we seek to broaden our global footprint”.Laurent Morel, chief executive of Klépierre, which owns or manages 271 shopping centres in Europe, said the entry of Simon Property provided scope for cross-selling between the US-based and European retail groups. “For us, it’s very favourable because the acquirer understands our strategy,” he said.Analysts expected more takeovers in the property sector given that many companies are trading at sizeable discounts to net asset value, having been hit by the economic downturn and lower consumer spending.
21;SPG;Simon Property Group;2012-02-19T03:36:19Z;Aiming to be as safe as houses;Caution is key at the First State Global Listed Property fund;Due to a mixed outlook in Europe as a result of the ongoing eurozone crisis, Andrew Nicholas, manager of the £80m First State Investments’ Global Listed Property Securities fund, says he has reduced the fund’s regional exposure in order to lower risk in the portfolio.“The negative economic backdrop is undermining rental growth, banks are reluctant to provide finance and real estate markets are generally sluggish,” he says.“We’re concerned about some property securities companies’ ability to generate increases in income, and make sure that the ones we invest in are able to pay their dividends,” he adds.To make sure that he gets each investment right, Mr Nicholas utilises the help of his 10-strong investment team based in New York, Sydney, Hong Kong and London.Mr Nicholas says the fund’s global mandate has helped it to outperform the IMA Property sector, returning 80.5 per cent over the past three years (to January 31), versus 34.8 per cent for the sector. Some parts of the world, such as Australia, Canada and parts of Asia, have been performing well compared to other markets, he says.However, the fund has underperformed against its benchmark, the UBS Global Real Estate Investors Index, which showed growth of 90.3 per cent over three years.Mr Nicholas has increased his weighting in Australia to roughly 10 per cent, as Australian real estate investment trusts have proved themselves to be relatively defensive in the wake of current volatility, he says. “A dividend yield of 6.5 per cent remains attractive in a low interest rate environment,” he says.He is also overweight Brazil but underweight Japan, Europe and – marginally – the US. He is underweight the UK by roughly 1 percentage point, as he does not expect a recovery there “anytime soon”.“Demand for German residential property and all sectors in Switzerland remains high. However, city markets such as Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam are under pressure,” Mr Nicholas says.“The London market is also in relatively good health, although demand is slipping in the office market because of job losses in the financial sector. For instance, we owned a London property specialist which we thought got a bit overvalued, so we pulled back.”His favourite areas are retail and office property, which make up 35.1 and 18.2 per cent of the portfolio, respectively.At a stock level, he is particularly positive about the prospects for companies such as Simon Property, a US commercial real estate company that is the country’s largest real estate investment trust, and is his top holding at more than 7 per cent.However, the remaining nine holdings in the top 10 have less than half this weighting, as Mr Nicholas continues to err on the side of caution.“In general, property markets have fallen since 2007/08, and it’s pretty hard to say when they will bottom out.

22;SPG;Simon Property Group;2012-01-15T14:25:47Z;Value Retail bucks eurozone gloom;;Bargain-hunting tourists from emerging markets have powered a 20 per cent rise in sales of cut-price designer goods for Value Retail, the European outlet chain.Best known for its Bicester Village outlet in Oxfordshire, which ranks as the UK’s third most popular tourist attraction, Value Retail achieved record sales of €1.5bn across its nine outlet villages in 2011 including those in Ireland, Spain and Italy.Despite the wider economic woes of the eurozone, tourists from Asia, Latin America and Russia are responsible for the lion’s share of the sales growth, snapping up discounted surplus products from an array of designer brands including Burberry, Versace and Armani.“In spite of the economy, one of Europe’s growth industries in the next five years will clearly be tourism,” said Scott Malkin, chairman of Value Retail. “Those who embrace the opportunity will triumph.”Kildare Village, its Irish outlet, recorded a 23 per cent jump in 2011 sales after spending from non-EU shoppers rose 38 per cent, according to tax reclaim analysis conducted by Global Blue. Mr Malkin said the Irish government’s relaxation of Chinese visa restrictions and Ethiad, the Middle Eastern airline, introducing direct flights to Ireland from Abu Dhabi were key factors behind the rise.In Spain, its La Roca village in Barcelona and Las Rozas outlet in Madrid both recorded a 60 per cent jump in sales to non-EU shoppers in 2011, who spent an average of €261 each. Tax refund data show sales to Brazilian customers in Spain rose 138 per cent and sales to Venezuelan customers increased 99 per cent in the period.The Fidenza Village in Milan saw a 71 per cent increase in sales to non-EU shoppers, who spent an average €370 each. Mr Malkin said Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern tourists were driving the rise in Italy.At Bicester Village, where 40 per cent of customers come from outside the EU, total sales rose 30 per cent with Chinese shoppers accounting for half of the tax-refunded sales.The private company, which operates the centres, is owned by management and property investors with stakes in its outlet villages, including Hammerson, Simon Properties, Deutsche Bank and Dutch pension fund APG.Since 2007, Value Retail has seen gross sales at its outlets rise by “at least 20 per cent” every year, and Mr Malkin is confident this level of growth can be sustained by rising numbers of international tourists. “We don’t see our outlets as shopping centres, but as high quality tourism destinations,” he said.However, he was critical of London’s “inhospitable” attitude to tourists in its Olympic year. “The Hammersmith flyover is a terrific loss of face for Britain,” he said, adding that passengers from Heathrow spent hours stuck in traffic before entering the “parking chaos in Westminster”.Combined with tougher visa restrictions and fees than other European countries, he said: “The message [the UK] gives to tourists is we don’t want you, and you’re not welcome.”
23;SPG;Simon Property Group;2011-10-07T11:40:23Z;Real estate investment trusts;Reits are not as profitable as they once were due to deleveraging;The global market spasm of the past couple of months has affected almost every sector. This means that some have been unfairly pulled down in the carnage, and investors may be tempted to see real estate investment trusts as one of the unfairly targeted sectors. Since August, the S&P 500 real estate investment trust index has fallen 15 per cent, half as much again as the S&P 500.In theory, Reits’ share prices should be less volatile than those of most other companies. They derive rental income from tenants locked in for contracted periods and have long-term earnings visibility.But in spite of their recent fizzle, Reits are not necessarily oversold. The simple fact is that they are not as profitable as they once were. Writedowns of their assets (which muddied comparable performance data for the past two years) are largely complete, yet Reits’ returns on equity are now about 13 per cent, a discount of more than half to the S&P 500, which boasts an ROE of 25 per cent. That compares with a discount of about one-third before the financial crisis.While revenues for the sector are about the same as they were before the crisis, deleveraging has eaten into returns. Debt providers have reduced the loan-to-value ratios they are prepared to accept and adjusting is proving difficult for some. Gecina, the French property group, this week jettisoned its chief executive citing “strategic differences”.Investors accept that a Reit’s return is often lower than the market. That is the price for owning a (generally) stable investment. Some large groups, such as Simon, Unibail-Rodamco, Land Securities and British Land own high-quality properties. However, with the performance of many Reits languishing far below their pre-crisis highs, investors will find that even the recent share price falls have not yet made many Reits worth it.

Mr Whittaker, who joined the board of CSC as deputy chairman as a result of the transaction, later said it had taken four years of talks that began with Sir Donald Gordon, Liberty International’s founder, who was not in attendance on Wednesday.Also attending were the advisory teams, with David Church and Simon Mackenzie-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Hew Glyn Davies from UBS, which both advised CSC, and Alex Midgen from Rothschild and Robert Fowlds from JPMorgan which advised Peel. Ian Henderson, former Land Securities chief executive, also listened with interest.Simon Property, the erstwhile suitor for CSC, was absent, but the meeting did not go without grumbles from smaller investors. One criticised the deal that had deprived them of the chance to consider Simon’s offer and complained about CSC’s failure to open its books. Mr Burgess replied it was standard practice not to reveal secrets to a competitor, adding there was never a sensible offer at an acceptable price from Simon. “We did not get to sweeteners; we were at sourdough.”…Serco hireAfter departures from its board in December, outsourcing group Serco – led by racing car-driving boss Chris Hyman – has added Paul Brooks, Experian’s numbers man, as a director.

Simon Property, which was not at the meeting, voted against the deal by proxy.Simon, which holds more than 5 per cent of CSC, made an indicative offer of 425p a share as an alternative to the deal with Peel, which it said gave away control of CSC too cheaply.Shares in CSC closed down 4.9p at 377.1p, having traded above 420p during the takeover period.Simon said it would track closely the progress of CSC’s board and management team “towards achieving the aggressive valuation targets they have recently established”.The deal is the largest-ever UK property transaction. Peel will receive a maximum stake of 23.2 per cent in CSC, with CSC also assuming the Trafford Centre’s debt.UBS and Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised CSC. Rothschild and JPMorgan advised Peel. Citigroup and Lazard advised Simon.CSC will now own 14 UK shopping centres, including four of the top six out-of-town malls. The Financial Times first revealed CSC was in talks to acquire the Trafford Centre last November, which prompted Simon’s interest the following day.Simon’s £2.9bn bid for CSC in December was deemed inadequate by the board, which refused to open its books to the company. CSC produced updated valuations for the company, which put an acceptable offer price at about 625p a share.Patrick Burgess, chairman of CSC, commented on the overwhelming support from shareholders for the acquisition of the Trafford Centre, describing the deal as value enhancing for CSC. “It will strengthen CSC’s position as the leading operator of pre-eminent UK regional shopping centres,” he said.Mr Whittaker, Peel chairman, told the shareholder meeting the sale had nothing to do with the amount of money, which would have been higher through a cash sale, but was related to the long-term future of his family business.

That cut the weekly gain for the index to 1.4 per cent.Profit taking sent Arm Holdings lower by 4.7 per cent to 460p on Friday. The chip designer had hit a 10-year high in the previous session on confirmation that Microsoft’s next build of Windows would be Arm-compatible.Cigarette makers were hit by a Citigroup downgrade, with British American Tobacco losing 2.2 per cent to £24.26 and Imperial Tobacco 1.8 per cent weaker at £19.82.While Citi reckoned that smokers would be extinct in most developed markets within 40 years, its downgrade was founded on pricing and volume trends over the shorter term. The broker also expected a regulatory push in Europe to introduce generic packaging.Capital Shopping Centres fell 2.6 per cent to 408¼p after management told Simon Property Group, Capital’s rebel shareholder and potential bidder, that the stock was worth up to 625p. The odds were now on Simon walking away ahead of its deadline on Wednesday to launch a formal offer, analysts said.Among the gainers, Whitbread rose 1.7 per cent to £18.87 after Credit Suisse set a £22.30 target price on raised forecasts.The broker also argued that Costa, Whitbread’s coffee chain, was now self-financing so may be spun off. It valued Costa alone at £772m, equivalent to 438p per share.Shire, the drug maker, rose 1.7 per cent to £15.89 after a positive note from US broker Cowen and Company. Safety concerns about Shire stimulant drugs had been overstated and, once the issue cleared, investors were likely to consider the company as a takeover target, it said.Mitchells & Butlers was in focus among the mid-caps, with shares in the pubs group slipping 1.1 per cent to 357p, after Derrick Smith raised his stake above the 3 per cent disclosure limit.JKX Oil & Gas lost 10.6 per cent to 286½p after Ukraine raised production-related taxes. JKX said its effective tax rate would increase immediately from around 30 per cent to 50 per cent.“The rapid change in the Ukrainian tax code is a reminder of the risks associated with the countries the company operates in,” said RBC analysts, who cut their price target on JKX shares by 40p to 390p.H&T Group rose 4.6 per cent to 335p after the UK’s largest pawnbroker said full-year profits would top City forecasts because of a strong performance from its cash-for-gold business.In response, Shore Capital raised forecasts, reiterated its “buy” recommendation and 325p target. It said the shares, which trade on 10 times 2011 earnings, were cheap given the potential for a doubling of the store network by 2016.Futura Medical fell 2.2 per cent to 77p on profit-taking after a strong run.However, broker Matrix reckons the company is about to win European product approval for CSD500, a condom that helps with erectile dysfunction.“If Futura receives full product approval and CE mark [approval], which we expect, we see a launch this year,” said analyst Navid Malik. “Given Futura potentially receives a high-teen royalty, we see a peak royalty of at least £15m.” Omega Insurance Holdingswas in focus after the Insurance Insider magazine claimed the company was in takeover talks with private equity-backed Canopius. The report claimed investors were willing to back an offer pitched at 120p a share. However, Omega fell 2.5 per cent to 97¼p after the insurer said losses related to last year’s earthquake in New Zealand could reach $16.8m. Omega also flagged exposure to the floods in Australia. Cadogan Petroleumlost 2.5 per cent to 97½p and takeover target Regal Petroleum fell 6 per cent to 23½p after Ukraine ratified a new tax code.
27;SPG;Simon Property Group;2011-01-11T20:46:48Z;Simon Property/CSC;The window shopping saga comes to an end, for now;"That’s enough window shopping, for now. Simon Property Group of the US has ditched its proposed £2.9bn bid for Capital Shopping Centres, allowing CSC to move closer to buying Manchester’s Trafford Centre shopping mall from Peel Holdings. Simon’s offer was conditional on CSC opening its books and dropping its purchase of Trafford; CSC’s board would do neither. Nor will the UK group’s shareholders find out any time soon whether Simon, with a 5 per cent stake acquired in 2008, was keener on buying their company, or on blocking the roughly 23 per cent stake that Peel will gain if they approve the Trafford deal.For Simon, it is the second rebuff in a year, after General Growth Properties, the US mall owner, rejected its advances. Never mind. Simon can bid for CSC again in six months, perhaps alongside its friends (and shareholders) the Lowys, who run Australia’s Westfield. The trouble is, given the CSC board’s vehement resistance to Simon’s earlier blandishments and its belief that CSC is worth as much as 625p to a bidder, to say nothing of Simon’s own discipline on price, a successful bid seems unlikely. Moreover, assuming CSC shareholders approve the Trafford deal, Simon would have to take on Peel’s owner John Whittaker. He is in for the long haul – and will take his CSC shares at 400p, a negligible premium to the group’s 390p December pro-forma net asset value.Although the Peel deal is not yet done, investors know that Simon has lost its chance to own CSC. No wonder the latter’s share price, which rose by almost a quarter from its undisturbed price of 340p on Simon’s interest, slipped a further 3 per cent on Tuesday to 382p. With its chance gone, Simon is likely to sell its minority stake, further hurting CSC’s share price. Investors should brace themselves.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
28;SPG;Simon Property Group;2011-01-11T17:09:37Z;Simon Property abandons £2.9bn bid for CSC;;"Simon Property Group has abandoned its £2.9bn bid to take over Capital Shopping Centres, sending shares in the shopping centre operator lower as one of its largest investors remained hostile to its acquisition of the Trafford Centre.Simon admitted it had not been able to proceed with a firm offer for the company after CSC refused to open its books for due diligence, which had always been a precondition for any deal.The US retail property investor, which owns slightly more than 5 per cent of CSC, reiterated its opposition to the “deeply unattractive” acquisition of the Trafford Centre.The £1.6bn deal, which would see its owner Peel Holdings take a stake of almost a quarter of CSC in exchange, sparked Simon’s bid as an alternative proposal before Christmas. Simon has said it will vote against the deal at a forthcoming emergency meeting.Shares in CSC have slumped in recent days from a high of more than 420p at the beginning of the year, as investors realised that a firm bid from Simon was unlikely to materialise given the precondition of due diligence.CSC on Tuesday urged shareholders to support the revised bid for the Trafford Centre at this month’s EGM as in the best interests of shareholders as a whole. Shares in CSC fell 2.8 per cent, or 10.9p, to 381.6p.But Simon has reserved the right to make or participate in an offer for CSC within the next six months. Charlie Foster, analyst at Oriel Securities, said: “We expect the shares to come off by about 10 per cent and it will be interesting to see whether Simon reduces its 5 per cent stake.”Last week, the CSC board set a new price target of 625p for any putative bid, raising the bar considerably above the 425p offer from Simon. The valuation, which was based on the back of new estimates of its estate and the Trafford Centre deal, was described as “wishful thinking” by Simon and “designed to frustrate” its offer.Simon could have raised its indicative offer, although this was always seen as a less likely option given continued management opposition and mixed shareholder support.The shopping centre operator has tried to counter concerns about the Trafford deal among investors with a change in the terms, al­though Simon said that the revised price did not address its concern about a transfer of control of CSC to Peel at a discounted price.CSC is advised by Merrill Lynch and UBS; Simon is advised by Citi and Lazard. JPMorgan Cazenove and Rothschild advise Peel."
29;SPG;Simon Property Group;2011-01-07T22:58:48Z;Simon could walk away from CSC bid;;Simon Property Group could be forced to walk away from its £3bn bid to take over Capital Shopping Centres next week in the face of the company’s increasingly strident defence of its position.Simon has until Wednesday to make a firm offer for CSC, the UK’s largest shopping centre operator.The property group is now seen as more likely to withdraw its indicative 425p offer ahead of the deadline, although no decision had been made last night.A key precondition to Simon’s bid has been gaining access to the books of CSC for due diligence, but there is no expectation that this condition will ever be fulfilled.The management of CSC has in the past stated that necessary information was already in the public domain.In fact, the CSC board on Friday strengthened its defence with a new price demand of 625p for any putative bid, which is £2 per share more than the indicative offer from Simon.CSC said that it was worth as much as 625p a share to a bidder on the back of a new valuation of its estate and value opportunities from a deal for the Trafford Centre, Manchester, in addition to 89p a share to reflect the strategic nature of its shopping centres.There is still a chance that Simon could raise its indicative offer, although this has been seen as a less likely option at present. All parties declined to comment.The takeover bid from Simon materialised following disclosure in November of a £1.6bn deal by CSC to acquire the Trafford Centre from Peel Holdings, the property company owned by John Whittaker.Simon, a CSC shareholder, opposed the deal as too expensive in cost and control, and instead made an alternative £2.9bn takeover offer for the company.CSC on Friday said that the bid from Simon “very substantially undervalues” its business.The shopping centre operator also moved to counter concerns among shareholders with a change in the terms.CSC said that 18m fewer shares will be issued to Peel but at a higher price of 400p each, up from 368p.Peel Group would be left with a maximum stake of 23.2 per cent, rather than 24.7 per cent.An exit by Simon at this stage could affect the company’s share price, which has increased by about a quarter in the wake of the Trafford Centre announcement and the offer from Simon.The tone of a no-bid statement would be crucial in this regard if there were to be any suggestion of a re-emergence of another offer later in the year.On Friday, Simon said that it was “heartened” to see revised terms of the Trafford Centre acquisition but said that these did not address fundamental concerns of a significant control of CSC being transferred to Peel at a discounted price.It said that the new potential net asset valuation of up to 625p seemed “designed to frustrate an offer from Simon” and added that it would vote against the deal at the CSC EGM on January 26.Shares in CSC closed the day down 10.9p at 408.2p.
30;SPG;Simon Property Group;2011-01-07T10:51:35Z;CSC revises offer for Trafford Centre;;Capital Shopping Centres has revised the terms of its acquisition of Manchester’s Trafford Centre in a move that would lead to the transfer of fewer shares to the mall’s owner, Peel Group.At the same time, it claimed that a potential 425p a share bid for CSC from Simon Property Group, the US mall operator, could undervalue the business by as much as £2 a share.CSC agreed to buy the Trafford Centre from Peel in late November in a share-fuelled deal that would make Peel, controlled by John Whittaker, its largest equity investor. It said the offer valued the Trafford Centre’s cash and equity at £1.6bn.However, the move was opposed by Simon, a major CSC shareholder, which accused CSC of overpaying and then made a 425p per share proposal to buy CSC instead.On Friday, CSC announced that the shares created in respect of the deal would be issued at a price of 400p rather than the 368p first envisaged.As a consequence, the number of shares Peel was due to receive as part of the deal dropped by 18.2m, from 224.1m to 205.9m. However, Peel would also now be handing £7m less cash to CSC.The revision comes after CSC shares increased in value by about a quarter in the wake of the Trafford Centre announcement and consequent bid interest from Simon.“Circumstances have clearly moved on since the Peel transaction was first struck,” said David Fischel, CSC chief executive.The smaller share transfer would lead to Peel ending up with 23.2 per cent of CSC, assuming the conversion of convertible bonds, rather than the 24.7 per cent previously envisaged.Peel would also be restricted from holding more than 24.9 per cent of CSC’s shares for three years.Holders of CSC shares are due to vote on the Trafford Centre deal on January 26 after the adjournment of a previous extraordinary meeting. Simon, meanwhile, has until January 12 to make a firm offer.CSC on Friday said it had identified “significant incremental value opportunities” from the Trafford Centre deal which implied that its net asset value per share could rise to 536p following the deal.It then claimed that a further 89p per share premium ought to be paid by any buyer of CSC, making a total potential net asset value per share of up to 625p. CSC shares fell 0.3 per cent to 417.9p in early morning trading on Friday.
31;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-12-29T00:24:59Z;Tills ring at Trafford Centre;;The Trafford Centre, the shopping mall at the centre of a £1.6bn transatlantic tug-of-war, boosted its profits in 2009 in spite of the global downturn.Results filed on Christmas Eve revealed the centre near Manchester achieved pre-tax profits of £25.4m in the year to March 31, up from £23.6m, on turnover of £84.8m (£87.8m).Peel Holdings, which owns the centre, has agreed to sell it to Capital Shopping Centres in a deal that values it at £1.6bn, which would give Peel 20 to 25 per cent of the listed group. The deal would also give John Whittaker, Peel’s chairman and majority owner, a seat on the board.However Simon Group, the US mall operator, has offered 425p a share, or £2.9bn, for CSC, provided it does not buy the Trafford Centre. The CSC board rejected the offer and the Takeover Panel, the stock market regulator, has given Simon until January 12 to improve it or put it to shareholders.Mr Whittaker will use the results to bolster CSC’s argument that he would bring know-how to the group. He believes shopping malls should be leisure destinations with multiple attractions and “razzmatazz”.The Legoland Discovery Centre, opened at Trafford in March 2010, had “exceeded all expectations” and brought new visitors to the centre along with inquiries from retailers, Peel said in its results.It added that the year had been “very challenging for the retail industry”.However, Peel said it had not followed the route of many centres in filling empty units with discount retailers at low rents. “In our view this is a contributing factor to the much publicised deterioration of many retail and town centres and it is damage that will be difficult to repair.”It said that refusing to cut rents had preserved its income during a 2008 review. However, high occupancy was vital as many retailers have 15-year leases taken out when the centre opened in 1998, which expire in 2013.Peel said: “Our refusal to compromise on tenant mix has been a key factor in attracting high-quality retailers who prefer to distance themselves from the ‘discount’ image many centres have been forced to adopt.”Visitor numbers increased by 6.4 per cent year-on-year to more than 35m. As a result of pressure from tenants, Peel cut service charges by £1m and said it expected a further decline of £340,000 in 2010-11, a fall of 20 per cent from 2008 levels. It cut the average number of staff from 416 in 2009 to 405 and the wage bill from £7.7m to £6.2m.
32;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
33;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-12-28T23:00:01Z;Property sector must work to stave off lull;;"If development was the main story for investors in the UK listed property sector in 2010, then next year will be about how companies take advantage of returning problems among the more heavily overleveraged in the market.The hard graft of working through the remaining problems caused by the crash will begin in earnest in 2011 after the unexpectedly sharp recovery over the past 18 months delayed the worst of the fall-out. Larger companies in the sector need to begin using their financial strength having returned balance sheets to good health; otherwise a dull year awaits, even if positive on a total returns outlook.Support will come from their mostly good quality income streams, with some rental growth in better-placed parts of portfolios – most obviously in London offices where developers will begin to find pre-lets for new schemes. Investors can also expect modest dividend growth, but yields remain unexciting at an average of about 4.5 per cent across the majors.But it is far from being all positive. Regional economic weakness and government cutbacks will remain negative for overall rental growth, while over-renting is still a factor in most portfolios. Meanwhile, following the rally in prime property, capital growth will be modest at best, and provide little support for shares.As such, there is a need for canny deal-making to make the difference, even if this can be difficult for the larger portfolios. Hammerson has scarcely been rewarded over peers for its astute activities this year, for example.However, if large generalist Reits are to outperform with above-average returns, they need to use their weight for large deals and corporate activity led by active managements looking for off-market deals. The £1.6bn Trafford Centre offer by Capital Shopping Centres showed admirable intent, even if pricing was perhaps full. There has otherwise been too much bidding against like-minded rivals at public auctions. Using the same spread sheets leads to the same conclusions, which does not make dynamic deal flow.Companies that have built empires tend to appear benevolent dictatorships, particularly in London, where a handful of investors making property calls have carved out success at Shaftesbury, Great Portland Estates and Derwent London. These nimble companies will remain in vogue next year, partly because London’s market emerges first from recession but also for their developments and nose for a bargain around the West End.There are also smaller stocks that are likely to show some excitement. In particular, there are those that will want to bolster financial positions with new investors as well as those able to benefit from the forced sale of property to solve debt calls from impatient banks. The companies positioned to exploit such opportunities – such as London & Stamford, Max Property, Metric Property, LXB Retail and Conygar – can be expected to have a good year.Aside from the conclusion of Simon Property’s 425p offer for CSC – a decision that remains finely poised given shareholder support for both sides – there is a good chance of further corporate and take-private transactions. Investors should look to where there are significant discounts, and at the smaller end this means the “zombie” investment companies that lack finance for future activity.There may be interest in more notable specialist developers. It could be worth watching companies such as Unite and Grainger, while next year might finally see movement in the self-storage space. The emergence of Laxey as a shareholder of Quintain is hardly surprising given a share price that spent much of 2010 at about 40p against a basic NAV of 120p. Attention should also return to Minerva next year, given the stake of almost 30 per cent still held by Nathan Kirsh, the South African investor, who is unlikely to sit on his hands after this year’s high profile fight with management.Forced salesMore broadly, next year is likely to be characterised by further debt problems across the sector, particularly if rising interest rates heap pressure on those pulled to safety by the plateauing bounce in values. New debt will remain constrained, while the weight of equity targeting property is still strong but has moderated. In fact, banks will probably step up attempts to recoup money from borrowers by forcing sales, with a wave of maturities of debts that were given extensions in 2008 and 2009.Managements need to outperform on their own merits rather than relying on market movement, some for the first time in many years, by seeking out accretive deals. For where some will struggle next year, those that have waited with the cash will enjoy life in a more choppy market.dan.thomas@ft.com"
34;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-12-15T21:08:21Z;Trafford bid keeps investors guessing;;Spoof is a drinking game of bluff and bluster very popular in the property industry. The worry among shareholders of Capital Shopping Centres is that Simon Property Group is “spoofing” for the company following its indicative £2.9bn bid.The management of CSC had been waiting for the phone to ring on Tuesday night with a last attempt by Simon to derail its acquisition of the £1.6bn Trafford Centre from Peel Holdings, as well as proof it was serious in its attempt to take control of the company.Wednesday was the last day that Simon could have swayed CSC’s South African shareholders, which hold more than 40 per cent of stock, in their vote on the Trafford Centre deal, given that many were casting proxy votes ahead of Thursday’s bank holiday.Although the 425p a share bid that Simon put forward was rejected by CSC’s board as inadequate, the delay forced on the shareholder meeting until the new year has at least meant that Simon has achieved its initial aim of upsetting the deal with John Whittaker’s Peel, if only temporarily.Simon has clearly never favoured the Trafford acquisition, and it was not alone in thinking that CSC is paying a full price. The Trafford Centre has strategic value for the UK’s biggest shopping centre owner, a point acknowledged by Simon in alternative financing proposals on Sunday, but the price was high in both cash terms and control of up to a quarter of a company being ceded to Peel. There was the prospect of locking up more than half the company in just three groups (Peel, the Donald Gordon family and the South African shareholders).However, Simon’s actions had until Wednesday not inspired confidence of a satisfactory alternative bid emerging, leading some analysts to conclude its intention was to stop the deal as much as buy the company even after the indicative offer of 425p. This was conditional on the demise of the Trafford deal and due diligence.At 425p, and a significant premium to net asset value, the bid appeared high enough to be interesting for some shareholders but not for all, particularly those in South Africa who are subject to limits on holdings of foreign assets. CSC has the status of a domestic stock, so does not use up the allowance.Mike Prew, analyst at Nomura, said he regarded this as a ‘phoney’ war and the offer inadequate given evidence of stronger UK Reit valuation. “It is not a knockout blow”, he concluded, suggesting the price needed to start at 450p.Harm Meijer, at JPMorgan, also said “it looks too low…another rabbit out of the hat is needed, but it needs to be a big one”.But Michael Burt, analyst at Execution Noble, said there were two clearing prices. For South African investors there was a greater cost. But in the UK, he said, the 425p bid represented a rare opportunity to realise a price that could take two years to materialise on asset value growth.The offer gained some traction with UK investors on Wednesday. “I would bite his hand off at 425p,” said one. “If there is a real bid on the table of course.”That is troubling other shareholders. Another investor, who said he was also happy with the 425p price, said: “I hate these indicative conditional deals that can be withdrawn at any time. There is a big worry that Simon is playing Spoof. And why now? Why not two weeks ago? First they didn’t like the [Trafford] deal, then they did, and now they don’t again.”Some in the CSC management camp regarded this as the last attempt to stall the acquisition of the Trafford Centre. Mr Whittaker is a man not noted for patience in such matters, and has already indicated that renegotiation of terms would not be acceptable.Simon sought to address such fears on Wednesday night, saying that the conditions set in the offer “were customary and should pose no barrier towards consummating a transaction. Simon’s board is fully supportive of the indicative offer and…there can be no serious doubt as to Simon’s desire and ability to complete the proposed transaction”.CSC, which has a high regard for the rarity value of its prime regional malls, is unlikely to accept a bid of less than 450p to win its recommendation. And with the board would likely come the votes of the founding Gordon family and with them a large number of the South African shareholders.Shareholders may also be loath to lose one of the few remaining large-cap property stocks. The universe for some fund managers is already small, with just four property companies in the FTSE 100. “I would become very sorry to see CSC out of the benchmark,” said one shareholder.Either way, shareholders have time to consider the alternatives ahead of next month’s meeting, in which time Simon could formalise its offer. Its approach could also spark interest among other groups for CSC, with talk that Simon could either team up with a UK Reit to offer alternative share options or create a new vehicle. The biggest spoof would be if shareholders voted down both Simon and the Trafford Centre in favour of the status quo.
35;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-12-15T21:03:19Z;Anglo American gains pace;;Disposal hopes lifted Anglo American on Wednesday even as the wider market stalled at a 2½-year high.Anglo shares gained 1 per cent to £31.09 after Credit Suisse speculated that the miner may spin out its De Beers diamond division.“De Beers is a unique asset and does not, in our view, receive a fair value from the market under the current shareholder structure,” Credit Suisse said. “A sale would allow Anglo to benefit from the higher multiple that diamond stocks attract.”With diamond miners typically trading at more than 17 times earnings, Anglo’s 45 per cent stake in De Beers could be worth between $4.3bn and $6.3bn, the broker argued.Anglo has already flagged up plans to sell assets including Tarmac and Peace River Coal, potentially raising more than $4bn, Credit Suisse said.The restructuring and reinvestment means Anglo offers the strongest volume growth among the large caps, with three big projects coming on stream over the next 18 months, it argued. The broker upgraded Anglo to “outperform” with a £36 target.The wider market went nowhere as volumes remained below average levels. The FTSE closed down 0.2 per cent or 9.03 points to 5,882.18 as financial stocks provided the main drag.Barclays led the blue-chip fallers, losing 3.7 per cent to 262p, after Moody’s warned Spain that its debt rating could be downgraded. Barclays has about £39bn of loan exposure to Spain, more than half of which is in residential mortgages, Macquarie analysts estimated.Precious-metals miners were weak after the Federal Reserve’s decision on Tuesday not to increase its Treasury buying programme sent gold lower. Fresnillo lost 2.5 per cent to £15.55 and Randgold Resources was 2 per cent weaker at £56.55.Among the gainers, Capital Shopping Centres rose 4.8 per cent to 415½p after rebel shareholder Simon Property made an indicative 425p-a-share takeover offer. CSC rejected the proposal as too low and too vague.Rexam jumped 3.8 per cent to 322½p on confirmation that it was looking at selling the speciality lid-making unit, which accounts for about a third of its plastics packaging division.“Rexam would free itself of the weakest link in its plastics portfolio,” said Merrill Lynch. “This would leave Plastics with reasonably attractive, niche positions in healthcare and personal closures [both profitable and growing] to complement the beverage can business.”Scottish & Southern Energy climbed 1.4 per cent to £11.66 on continued speculation of a break-up bid, with E.on rumoured to be among the interested parties. SSE shares were also helped by Deutsche Bank “buy” advice as part of a sector review.Autonomy rose 4.8 per cent to £14.75. One theory was that the software maker was set to announce an acquisition, though traders said the strength may also have reflected end-of-year short covering. About 3.8 per cent of Autonomy shares are out on loan, equivalent to 6.5 days’ average volume, according to Data Explorers.AstraZeneca rose 1.4 per cent to £31.49 ahead of the US drug regulator’s decision due Thursday on its Brilinta blood thinner, with the treatment widely expected to be approved.Morgan Stanley, AstraZeneca’s house broker, forecast Brilinta to generate peak sales of $3.3bn compared with a consensus of $1.9bn. It also expected AstraZeneca to spend $42bn on dividends and share buy-backs before 2014, which it said was 20 per cent more than market expectations.Among the mid-caps, Betfair bounced 5.6 per cent to £10.45 as BarCap argued that Tuesday’s post-results slump was an overreaction. The broker upgraded the company to “overweight” with a £13 target price.Supergroup, the fashion retailer that was floated at 500p in March, dropped 10.9 per cent to £14.50 after results triggered profit-taking. Traders blamed the drop on a cautious comment regarding rising cotton prices, which was compounded by an untidy “sell” order early in the session.MAM Funds was up 26.8 per cent to 35½p after the asset manager appointed former Gartmore fund manager Gervais Williams as a managing director. In addition, MAM announced plans to raise £20m via a share issue at 33p each to repay debt and preference shares, write Neil Hume and Bryce Elder.Pursuit Dynamics, the fluid technology company, rallied 0.6 per cent to 493p after its new finance director declared the purchase of 5,000 shares. The stock had dropped sharply on Tuesday amid pressure from short sellers.Renovo jumped 16.7 per cent to 56p after Roger Pannone, the drug developer’s chairman, declared the purchase of 20,000 shares at 48.8p each. Nomura analysts highlighted signs of progress for the group’s Juvidex scar reduction treatment in recent results.“For Juvidex, the company has clearly advanced partnering discussions and is now guiding to a deal being concluded ‘late 2010/early 2011’,” it noted.Brewin Dolphin, the wealth management company, fell 5.6 per cent to 151p as funds that tracked the small cap index were forced to sell stock ahead of the company’s promotion to the FTSE 250. Brewin is taking the place of BlueBay Asset Management, which is being acquired by Royal Bank of Canada.Local Shopping Reit gained 1.3 per cent to 56¼p after Matrix upgraded it to “add” in response to the property group’s forming of a £100m joint venture with Pramerica, Prudential Financial’s real-estate unit.Indonesia-based Sound Oil slipped 6.9 per cent to 1.35p after it announced plans to buy Consul Oil & Gas, which has 17 exploration licences and applications in Italy.Sound Oil said it would help pay for the deal by placing shares at 1.2p share to raise £3.7m.Xcite Energy dropped 11.3 per cent to 225½p on news that critical testing of its Bentley heavy oil field in the North Sea had been further delayed because of an operational problem.
36;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-12-15T18:20:05Z;Simon/Capital Shopping Centres;;David Simon must be kicking himself. If the chairman of Simon Group, the largest US shopping mall owner, had made his £2.9bn offer for the UK’s Capital Shopping Centres three months ago, shareholders would have almost certainly accepted. CSC’s share price has languished around 350p for the last six months with little chance of hitting the 425p offered by Simon on Wednesday anytime soon. But now things are more complex.CSC’s proposed £1.6bn acquisition of the Trafford shopping centre would ruin Simon’s plans for a full acquisition of CSC, by handing a 25 per cent stake to Trafford’s owner Peel, entrepreneur John Whittaker’s company. Mr Whittaker’s holding would be a significant obstacle to any future Simon bid. Simon’s proposal to boost its stake in CSC to 27 per cent last Sunday was knee-jerk, but its Wednesday offer for the whole company is more genuine. In response, CSC’s board sensibly decided to reschedule next week’s shareholder vote on the Trafford deal until the end of January.But for Simon, this concession on timing is just the first step. It still needs to find financing, although that should not be too difficult. A greater challenge comes from CSC’s South African shareholders, who control about 45 per cent of the shares, through CSC’s dual listing in Johannesburg. This arrangement offers them regulatory and currency advantages, which Simon may need to duplicate – by creating a UK-based, South African listed holding company – to gain their support.The biggest battle, though, will be to convince CSC’s board to break its contract with Peel and support the takeover. CSC may want an offer of 450p or more before it warms to Simon – a bid that is unlikely to materialise. As successful hostile property bids are almost unheard of, CSC’s shareholders should brace themselves for some intense lobbying.

38;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-12-15T17:51:00Z;CSC spurns £2.9bn bid approach from Simon;;Capital Shopping Centres has rejected the £2.9bn takeover bid from US rival Simon Property Group but has been forced to delay a key shareholder vote over the contested acquisition of Manchester’s Trafford Centre.The US shopping mall operator on Wednesday said it would be willing to offer 425p a share for CSC if certain conditions were met, including the non-completion of the £1.6bn acquisition of the Trafford Centre from Peel Holdings and satisfactory due diligence.CSC, the largest owner of regional shopping centres in the UK, this afternoon rejected the indicative offer as “another attempt by Simon to frustrate the Trafford Centre acquisition without putting forward a proper proposal”.The board said that 425p “very substantially” undervalued the company and its prospects, and questioned the need for further due diligence and conditions. It has initiated a discussion with the Takeover Panel to establish a latest date and time by which Simon must make a formal offer.It added that it would postpone an extraordinary meeting of CSC shareholders to vote on the Trafford Centre deal until late January.In a letter to CSC’s board, David Simon, Simon’s chairman and chief executive, claimed that other shareholders were opposed to the Trafford Centre deal. “We believe that we [Simon and the CSC board] should work together to announce a recommended offer,” he said.Simon, which is a 5 per cent shareholder in CSC, said it was finalising a bridge loan facility worth about £3bn for the transaction. The deal, which would be worth £2.94bn, would also need approval from Simon’s board and shareholders.Shares in CSC rose sharply to 416p, having opened at 396p, in afternoon trading in London on Wednesday following disclosure of the approach. Analysts were still sceptical of the bid being carried at 425p, however. Nomura and JPMorgan both said that the price was too low, in particular for CSC’s large group of South African shareholders.CSC last month announced it had reached an agreement to buy the Trafford Centre for £1.6bn including assumed debt in exchange for shares in the company.The centre, one of the most popular in the UK, is owned by Peel, a family property company controlled by John Whittaker, who would become CSC’s biggest shareholder and deputy chairman with a stake of between 20-25 per cent.Simon said it was concerned that CSC was overpaying for the asset, and objected to the controlling stake that would be assumed by Mt Whittaker. On Sunday, it suggested an alternative financing proposal for the deal that would have given it a dominant stake in CSC but was again rebuffed.CSC was formed earlier this year when Liberty International, a real estate investment trust, split into two companies.
39;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Simon / CSC;US property investor’s offer of cash may be too little too late;A surprise phone call from the office on Sunday afternoon is never a good sign. The culprit over the weekend was David Simon, chairman of the eponymous US property investor, who presented a letter to Patrick Burgess, his counterpart at the UK’s Capital Shopping Centres. He proposed to provide cash for CSC’s £1.6bn acquisition of Manchester’s Trafford Shopping Centre from Peel, entrepreneur John Whittaker’s investment vehicle. In return, Simon’s stake in CSC would increase from 5 to 27 per cent.The catch is that Mr Whittaker does not want cash. Under Peel’s contract with CSC, it receives a 25 per cent stake in CSC and Mr Whittaker will become deputy chairman. Although Simon’s financing proposal looks better on paper – it will buy shares of CSC at 400p, compared with Peel’s valuation of 367p – the cash appears a deal-breaker.In reality the bickering is not over price or the Trafford Centre, but the future ownership of CSC itself. As it stands, Mr Whittaker looks to have the upper hand. First, he has the support of the CSC’s shareholders, who have already subscribed for the £221m equity placement to supplement the Peel deal. Second, rejection of Simon now may well coax out a higher offer if it makes a complete bid for CSC later. To persuade an entrenched Mr Whittaker to sell out, Simon would have to pay a hefty premium – perhaps as much as 20 per cent – over the undisturbed share price of about 380p.Simon’s late offer is the next best thing to an admission it did not act quickly enough to build a cheaper stake in CSC. While that chance may be gone, the experience provides useful lessons: it is called first mover advantage for a reason, and surprise letters are more welcome on a Monday.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
40;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-12-13T11:37:20Z;CSC rebuffs fresh approach from Simon;;Simon Property Group, the US mall operator bidding for Capital Shopping Centres, has tabled alternative plans that would give it a dominant stake through funding a proposed acquisition of the £1.6bn Trafford shopping centre.However, the CSC board rejected the fresh proposal as “completely impracticable”, promising to stick to plans for a shareholder vote on the acquisition from Peel Holdings next week.In November, CSC, the largest retail property company in the UK, agreed to buy the Trafford Centre in Manchester for £1.6bn in a deal that would pay at least 19.9 per cent of CSC’s equity to John Whittaker’s Peel Holdings.The transaction was opposed by Simon, a 5 per cent shareholder. It instead offered the prospect of a “superior” but unpriced bid for the company. CSC rebuffed the attempt last week and refused Simon further information.On Sunday, the US group presented an alternative proposal that would see CSC raise cash for the acquisition of the Trafford Centre from existing shareholders, including Simon, which would end up with a dominant stake given an offer to support the majority of the raising at a price higher than that agreed with Peel. It said that the earlier proposal remained on the table.The CSC board, which has recommended the purchase to shareholders ahead of a meeting on December 20, rejected the alternative proposals as “incapable of implementation and completely impracticable”. It said that Peel wanted to be paid in shares rather than cash as it aimed to remain an investor in regional malls through CSC.Peel Group said on Monday that it had no intention of selling the Trafford Centre for cash. It said: “This has never been an aim of the group - in spite of the fact that Peel has been advised a cash sale would achieve a higher price. Rather, Peel’s stated objective is to increase and diversify its exposure to the UK shopping centre market via a long-term investment in CSC.”Some analysts expect that this latest development could lead to an indicative offer from Simon, with shareholders expecting a price of at least 400p to begin discussions. Harm Meijier, analyst at JPMorgan, said an indicative offer for CSC had a high chance of appearing, although added an offer including Trafford Centre or the arrival of a third party on the scene was also possible.In a letter to the board on Sunday, David Simon, chief executive of Simon, had said the proposals would overcome concerns about overpaying for the Trafford Centre and ceding significant control to Peel without a premium.Simon has proposed to subscribe for 205.5m shares at a price of 400p per share, representing a 6.1 per cent premium to net asset value. Peel had agreed to take up to 224.1m shares on a blended share price of about 367p. The issue would comprise 153.3m shares, together with £209m of bonds convertible into 52.2m shares.The placing would be subject to a partial clawback of up to 50 per cent in favour of other CSC shareholders. Simon’s minimum resulting shareholding, assuming full clawback, would be 18.4 per cent, but could rise almost 27 per cent if bonds were converted. Simon also asked for a board seat, and said that it would match the Peel standstill requirements.
41;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-12-08T23:19:48Z;CSC has simply no real reason to do what Simon says;;Capital Shopping Centres – product of the break-up of sleepy Liberty International – is an unlikely headline-maker. But by proposing the first major shares-for-assets deal this cycle to acquire the £1.6bn Trafford Centre, it has woken up not just the property sector but its own 5 per cent shareholder Simon Property Group.The US company’s interest in the UK real estate investment trust appears to offer shareholders an alternative to the Trafford Centre deal, which, once complete, would give the shopping centre’s vendor Peel Holdings a poison pill-shaped 25 per cent stake in CSC.But the Simon proposal looks sketchier by the day and is laden with conditions. The US company has called on CSC shareholders to reject the deal with Peel, but it offers no details of its own bid, having seemingly dropped the cash offer promised two weeks ago. It says it cannot proceed if CSC does not allow more due diligence.CSC’s more passive shareholders would be happy for it to bolster its portfolio with the impressive Trafford Centre. But others are worried about ceding influence to reclusive northern billionaire John Whittaker, Peel’s owner, at a low price. Mr Whittaker will gain his influential position on the register at a discount to net asset value and liquidity in the shares will be cut. While the Simon alternative is ill-drawn, the US company is right that the pricing of the Trafford Centre off a yield of about 5 per cent is full. It would add significantly to CSC’s gross rental income but would have only a neutral effect on earnings per share.But there are reasons why Simon may balk at paying enough to persuade CSC to reconsider its recommendation of the Peel deal. Any bid would have to start above 400p, against Wednesday’s closing price of 386.2p, and some investors would expect 420p. Meanwhile, core South African shareholders’ loyalty to CSC management and the approval of Liberty’s founder Donald Gordon, whose family interests still account for about 14 per cent, stack the December 20 vote in favour of the Trafford Centre purchase.Simon says: open your books. CSC could call the US group’s bluff by doing so. But arguably, there is enough information in the public domain already for Simon to advance an indicative offer. Having recommended the Peel deal and garnered the support of core shareholders, CSC can tough it out and let Simon, its conditions unmet, makes its exit with honour (more or less) intact.Flirting with controversyComplaints about De La Rue’s “failure” to declare sooner that it had received a preliminary approach from Oberthur of France confuse two issues: whether it should have announced the flirtation and whether it should have pursued it.On the former, it seems clear that there was no obligation under takeover rules for the banknote printer to announce that it had an unwanted suitor when the first billet doux arrived from Paris. Courtships can be kept secret as long as they don’t leak. The question is whether last week’s market activity – shares up 15 per cent in three days, accompanied by vague rumours of an approach by a different company – required a statement. But this rally came at the end of a long period of share price decline as De La Rue wrestled with reputational damage, and after an investor roadshow that prompted the issue of a couple of positive analysts’ notes. A tough call, but the requirement to reveal all was not met. You can argue that De La Rue directors, fighting to change a culture of over-zealous secrecy, should have said more, but they did not have to.As for whether the initial flame of interest from Oberthur should have been kept alive, that is a matter the French company will now get to explore direct with De La Rue’s shareholders.When bank duty callsGovernance expert Bob Garratt adds a piquant detail to the debate on the duties of bank directors, following the Financial Services Authority’s non-report on failing at Royal Bank of Scotland.He recalls advising the late Sir Brian Pitman, former head of Lloyds TSB, on the bank’s director development programme. Directors needed to balance three factors, Pitman explained: meeting the reasonable demands of the owners, scrutinising the cost of capital and fulfilling their fiduciary duty to ensure that the bank had a long-term future. This should be the focus of all board decisions.Sir Brian told Professor Garratt that the most difficult task was to manage the perception of “reasonable demands” by the owners. If those demands were seen as unreasonable, directors had only one option: they should resign.CSC: dan.thomas@ft.comandrew.hill@ft.com
42;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-12-08T15:22:15Z;Simon puts fresh pressure on CSC;;Simon Property Group, the US mall operator, has stepped up its attempt to acquire Capital Shopping Centres, demanding access to the company’s books and threatening to sell its 5 per cent stake if CSC goes ahead with an alternative deal.CSC has agreed to buy the Trafford Centre in Manchester for £1.6bn ($2.5bn) in a deal that would cede at least 19.9 per cent of CSC’s equity to John Whittaker’s Peel Holdings.Simon, a 5 per cent shareholder in CSC, said it intended to make a “superior” bid for the company as long as the acquisition was abandoned.That would mean the takeover of CSC, Britain’s largest mall operator after it demerged from Liberty International earlier this year, by one of the biggest US retail groups.On Wednesday, Simon warned in a letter to the CSC board that the Trafford transaction would destroy CSC’s value and cause Simon to sell its shares. It asked for more information to prepare its bid.The CSC board, which has recommended the Trafford Centre purchase to shareholders ahead of a meeting on December 20, said that it was not appropriate to provide non-public due diligence information without an indicative offer.It added that the Trafford Centre deal was of significant benefit for shareholders, and that the arguments used by Simon were “selective and created an inaccurate representation of the transaction”.Simon said earlier on Wednesday that it was “disturbed and disappointed by the profound value destruction proposed to be inflicted” on CSC and its shareholders. The US group said its biggest problem with the Trafford acquisition was that it would be “transferring significant control to Peel, while failing to extract a premium”.The deal is to be financed through a placing of 62.3m shares at 355p, giving Peel a 19.9 per cent stake in CSC at a discount to its current share price. Peel’s stake could rise to 24.9 per cent if it exercises its convertible bonds, while Mr Whittaker would become CSC’s deputy chairman.Simon warned that the deal would reduce the amount of cash available to shareholders in the form of dividends, and said that, on an annual pro forma basis, the deal would reduce cash flow by £29.6m and increase debt payments.CSC responded that the overall transaction was expected to have a neutral impact on earnings per share in the first full year and on net asset value per share. It regarded the long-dated securitised debt as an attractive component of the transaction, it said, enhancing the overall financial position of CSC and lengthening its average debt maturity.The high quality income stream of the Trafford Centre, it added, would further enhance its overall financial position, and CSC’s dividend policy would be unchanged by the transaction.Shares in CSC fell 21.8p to 386.2p.

Shares in CSC shares closed up 43.6p, or 13 per cent, at 381p.If the deal goes through Peel will own 19.9 per cent of CSC, rising to 24.9 per cent if it exercises its convertible bonds. John Whittaker, billionaire chairman of Peel, will become deputy chairman of CSC.The deal values the Trafford Centre at just less than £1.6bn, given its £798m net debt. Peel will pay £77.1m in cash and receive 167.3m shares and £209m of convertible bonds.That would accelerate CSC’s move into out-of-town shopping, which would be 64 per cent of assets compared with 52 per cent in June. It would also extend its lead over Hammerson, the second-largest operator of shopping centres.However, while the Gordon family, CSC’s largest shareholder with 14.6 per cent, supported the transaction, Simon Property opposed it.CSC said Simon Property sent a letter on Wednesday about a “potential cash offer for the company at an unspecified premium to net asset value. The letter did not contain any offer or indicative offer nor provide any certainty that an offer would be made”. Simon Property could not be reached for comment.Patrick Burgess, chairman of CSC, said any offer would be discussed at an extraordinary meeting in December.If the Trafford Centre acquisition is approved, CSC would own 14 of the top 25 UK shopping centres, including Lakeside in Essex and the Arndale centre in Manchester.The Trafford Centre is the fourth biggest retail centre in the UK, with 35m visitors annually.Mr Whittaker said Peel would invest equity, assets and expertise “to assist in taking the company forward to new heights”.Peel has been seeking to sell controlling stakes as it moves out of operational management.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS are advising CSC, while JPMorgan Cazenove is advising Peel.
44;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-11-25T20:35:00Z;Simon / CSC;With a bid by Simon now unlikely, investors face a tough choice;"Only hours away from the four-day weekend, the directors of Simon Property Group, the largest shopping mall owner in the US, rushed a letter to the board of Simon’s British equivalent, Capital Shopping Centres. The message: please stop. Simon, a 5 per cent owner of CSC, was referring to the latter’s equity placement and planned £1.6bn acquisition of the Trafford Centre mall in Manchester. To entice CSC to pause, it added it would consider a cash bid for CSC itself. CSC’s share price, which fell 5 per cent on Wednesday, jumped 14 per cent on Thursday.Simon’s intervention may reflect the limits to growth at home, where its dominance is creating competition issues. Meaningful international expansion requires acquisition of sizeable companies, such as CSC. But the Trafford Centre deal would make a full acquisition of CSC harder. Simon would have to persuade billionaire John Whittaker, who controls Trafford’s owner Peel, to sell. Peel is set to get a 19.9 per cent stake in CSC.But Simon’s directors proved unreachable on the sacred Thanksgiving holiday, so CSC went ahead and raised £221m from an equity placement to help fund the deal; all systems are go. The deal does need shareholder approval at a meeting in three weeks time but, with agreements signed and money now raised, that looks to be a formality.Investors now have a tough choice. The 14 per cent jump in CSC’s share price is predicated on a bid by Simon, itself seemingly contingent on the Trafford deal not going through. Now that it looks as though the deal will be successful, a bid by Simon is unlikely. As the situation may not clear up until Monday at the earliest, short-term investors may wish to use the post-Thanksgiving Friday to take their profits and run.E-mail the Lex team confidentially"
45;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-11-25T20:26:03Z;Betfair slips after analysts attack stock as 70% overvalued;;Betfair was targeted by analysts in a quiet London market on Thursday when they said the stock was overvalued by 70 per cent.“Betfair is approaching maturity in the UK, faces significant regulatory threats elsewhere, and will gain little traction in financials,” said Investec analyst Paul Leyland.Betfair founders and early backers last month floated the stock at £13 apiece, which valued the sports betting exchange at £1.3bn. This valuation needed “everything to go right”, Investec said. But it argued that growth was becoming tougher to deliver as occasional gamblers were less likely to be attracted by the better odds it offered. Investec also said Betfair’s expansion plans were far from guaranteed.“Betfair needs a liberal tax and regulatory approach to online gambling in order to operate, let alone to thrive,” Mr Leyland said. “We see this as increasingly unlikely in any major market.”Moving on to Lmax, Betfair’s spin-off for financial market trading, Investec described it as “a solution without a problem” that did nothing to challenge the existing broker model. “We do not see Betfair’s ‘disruptive technology’ having much to disrupt,” it said.The broker set a 445p target price on Betfair stock, which closed lower by 0.5 per cent at £14.71.Wall Street’s holiday meant the wider market drifted higher in thin trade, with the FTSE 100 ending up 0.7 per cent or 41.83 points, at 5,698.93. Fewer than a billion blue-chip shares were traded across the main exchanges, for only the fifth time since the turn of the year.Real estate companies moved higher after Capital Shopping Centres said its shareholder Simon Property Group was considering making a cash bid for the group.The move was seen as an attempt to block Capital’s planned purchase of the Trafford Centre in Manchester, which would give its owner John Whittaker up to 25 per cent of the expanded group.Capital jumped 12.9 per cent to 381p. Hammerson rose 4.8 per cent to 405¾p and Land Securities was up 2.4 per cent to 654½p. British Land added 2.9 per cent to 492p, aided by Goldman Sachs’ “buy” advice.Goldman was also positive on Old Mutual, which rose 2.2 per cent to 128p. “The current price offers an attractive entry point to a stock predominantly based in an emerging market currency and unaffected by recent sovereign credit fears,” it said.Marks and Spencer gained 2.4 per cent to 384p after an upgrade to “buy” from Arden Partners analyst Nick Bubb. Cold weather was delivering ideal trading conditions for clothes retailers and recent John Lewis figures suggested the premium end of the market was in good shape, he said.Whitbread was up 3 per cent to £17.50 after UBS advised clients to switch into the hotel operator and out of Ladbrokes, up 0.3 per cent to 126p. Both companies looked to be trading strongly but the former was scheduled to announce results before the latter, UBS reasoned.In a firm mining sector, Rio Tinto rose 2.2 per cent to £42.69 ahead of its annual investor meetings beginning on Friday. Credit Suisse saw scope for Rio to raise dividend guidance.Autonomy bounced 1.6 per cent to £12.91 after the software group clarified on its website that its acquisition plans were delayed rather than altered in size or scope. On Wednesday, the software company had said it was examining an “additional opportunity”.Profit-taking sent Compass Group lower by 3.2 per cent to 548p after Wednesday’s results had lifted the stock to within a penny of a record high. The caterer is a favourite among analysts, with 28 “buy” recommendations and no “sells”.Among the mid-caps, Gartmore paused at 101½p in spite of a revival of chatter that Henderson Global Investors could make a bid.Newspaper group Daily Mail & General Trust fell 3.5 per cent to 544½p after its full-year results were undermined by a change to its accounting policy for 2011.The move, if taken in this year, would have cut profits by 7 per cent, said analysts at Collins Stewart.Regal Petroleum jumped 46 per cent to 18¼p after the Ukraine-focused explorer said it had received a number of takeover approaches.Analysts said TNK-BP, Lukoil and Chevron might all be interested in Regal’s assets. But they questioned whether a buyer would offer more than 20p a share, or £64m, for the company.Although Regal had £40m of cash in the bank at the end of June and was due to sell a Romanian asset for about £13m, most of the cash may have been earmarked for Saipem, its rig contractor, they said.Bowleven advanced 6.5 per cent to 338p on news of an additional discovery at its Sapele prospect, offshore Cameroon. “Sapele could turn out to be a major discovery for the company with the potential to yield 100m barrels of oil or more already with further objectives still to be drilled by this well,” said Canaccord Genuity.Other analysts pointed out that the wells, while deep, were in shallow water and an accelerated exploration campaign would cost only $100m-$150m.JJB Sports added 5.3 per cent to 6½p on rumours of stakebuilding. But traders noted that house broker Panmure Gordon had cut its rating on the retailer from “buy” to “hold”. “We believe that the investment case has become more risky over the past two weeks . . . due to an intensification of competition,” it said.There was heavy trading in Dominion Petroleum, up 6.4 per cent to 5p, and in Cove Energy, which rose 5.5 per cent to 87p. The shares gained on talk that Andarko had made a big find off the coast of Tanzania, where both UK companies have projects.Leed Petroleum, the Gulf of Mexico explorer, dropped 17.5 per cent to 2½p on news that it had put itself up for sale after breaching the terms of its banking covenants with lender UniCredit. Europa Oil & Gas jumped 43 per cent to 23p on promising results from a well in Romania.
46;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
47;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-11-08T02:48:36Z;GGP sees future after model transformation;;Bankruptcies rarely end happily. Yet when General Growth Properties, which owns about 200 US shopping malls, emerges from Chapter 11 as expected this week, the company’s lenders would have been paid in full or will be.Shareholders last year saw shares in the country’s second-biggest mall owner, which operates famous sites such as South Street Seaport in Manhattan and The Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian in Las Vegas, fall below 50 cents from an early-2007 high of nearly $70.But they will now own about a third of a recapitalised GGP, with the shares having recovered to just below $18, and have a large stake in a new company housing GGP’s development properties.This success story – in what constitutes the first major restructuring of commercial mortgage-backed securities– could, GGP’s bankruptcy judge said, act as “a model as to value that can be preserved for the benefit of all stakeholders”.“This should permit other CMBS restructurings to happen out of court,” says James Sprayregen, partner at Kirkland & Ellis, pointing to the approximately $700bn securities due to mature before 2017. “The very fact that people now know it can be done in court will help them reach agreement out of court.”Earlier this year, an investor group led by Brookfield Asset Management and backed by activist investor Bill Ackman saw off takeover interest from Simon Property Group, agreeing to invest $6.5bn of new equity in GGP.But the foundations for the company’s rehabilitation were laid long before that battle. In late 2008, the company faced vast maturities of CMBS debt with about $9.9bn due by 2012.“The company would have had a difficult time rolling over its debt even before Lehman,” says Ken Buckfire, managing director of investment bank Miller Buckfire, referring to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. “After Lehman, it was impossible.”In spite of almost $28bn of debt and slumping mall values, GGP remained solvent. But it needed to prevent lenders seizing property as their loans became due.For the company’s restructuring team – Miller Buckfire and Alix Partners, alongside two law firms, Kirkland & Ellis and Weil Gotshall & Manges – there were two initial headaches.The first was the controversial decision to put the entire company into bankruptcy in April 2009, including 162 special purpose – supposedly “bankruptcy-remote” – entities.“The company could have bought itself a little time if it attempted to resolve its loan maturities on a piecemeal basis but it would have lost all strategic flexibility to negotiate with the creditors as a group,” argues Ronen Bojmel, managing director at Miller Buckfire.“The real estate industry was under the incorrect impression that these CMBS vehicles could not file for bankruptcy,” says Mr Sprayregen. “But with such a complicated structure, it was difficult to see how you could have an organised, accelerated process out of court.”In the event, investors’ worst fears – that the SPEs would be consolidated with the rest of the company in bankruptcy – were not realised. But GGP’s case has already prompted a rethink of the boom-time documentation for CMBS financings.Dan Rubock, senior vice-president at Moody’s Investors Service, says: “The market responded very clearly and fairly uniformly in crafting provisions for future CMBS deals that effectively address the key factors in allowing SPEs at GGP to go into bankruptcy.”The second difficulty for GGP’s team was securing bankruptcy financing when lenders were effectively closed for business.Bill Ackman, a large GGP shareholder, offered financing without covenants that helped draw out similar proposals. “All of a sudden, the same institutions that the week before were telling us they needed very tough terms changed their approach,” recalls Tom Nolan, GGP chief operating officer. The team set about separately negotiating terms on $15bn of mortgage debt across 103 loans. Their success became apparent as GGP’s mall vehicles were allowed to leave bankruptcy ahead of the holding company and the stock rose.By the end of 2009, the shares had climbed to $12, setting the stage for the fight between Brookfield and Simon Property Group.GGP and its advisers argue that the case illustrates the merits of Chapter 11, which prevented the company being taken apart, mall by mall.For Mr Sprayregen, the lessons of GGP are simple. “Don’t assume anything, think creatively and read the documents. Conventional wisdom was that you couldn’t do this.”
48;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-05-07T20:39:08Z;General Growth favours Brookfield bid;;A bankruptcy judge on Friday gave the nod to a $7bn standalone recapitalisation plan for General Growth Properties, the bankrupt US shopping malls owner, prompting Simon Property Group to walk away from the takeover offer it had tabled for the company.The board of GGP had asked US bankruptcy judge Allan Gropper to approve the offer from Brookfield Asset Management, even after Simon late on Thursday increased its offer for the company laying out its “best and final” offer at $20 a share, or about $6.5bn.In response, Brookfield tweaked its plans for GGP, made in concert with Fairholme Capital Management and Pershing Square, a GGP investor, to win the company’s backing.Brookfield and its partners added an additional $500m in equity to the recapitalisation plan and agreed that warrants given to the investors would be granted over time, with only 40 per cent due immediately on the court’s approval of the package.Pershing Square, the hedge fund led by Bill Ackman, agreed to waive its right to those warrants entirely, while the strike price on the remaining warrants was increased.GGP shares traded well under $1 in early 2009 as the owner of more than 200 shopping malls struggled to refinance its debt, eventually collapsing into bankruptcy. The stock on Friday fell more than 11 per cent to $14.07 as markets in both the US and Europe slumped.Shares in Simon rose 0.9 per cent to $85.68.David Simon, chairman and chief executive of Simon, on Friday said in a statement, “We are disappointed that the GGP board hastily decided in less than 24 hours to accept substantially less value, rather than take more time to fully assess the benefits of SPG’s offer and enter into negotiations to make this value available to GGP shareholders.”The Brookfield proposal was chosen by GGP because it provided the investment needed by the company but did not preclude GGP from receiving a higher bid in the months before it exits bankruptcy, said people close to the company. Brookfield and its partners have agreed to a guarantee provision of the $2bn GGP needs, in addition to its $7bn investment, after its emergence from bankruptcy, expected later this year.In addition, the Brookfield proposal did not raise potential anti-trust concerns, these people added, which added to the risk surrounding a deal with Simon, the largest owner of malls in the US.Simon has maintained that those concerns are overblown.Mr Simon this week wrote, “You have raised regulatory concerns both publicly and privately, which we believe are misplaced due to the highly fragmented nature of the retail real estate industry.”Simon, in addition to its takeover offer, had also submitted a recapitalisation proposal which would have left the mall owner as a passive but significant shareholder in its rival.
49;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-05-03T16:45:37Z;Liberty split could unleash keen market interest;;In a few days, the UK property sector will see how supportive the market is of the demerger of one of its biggest beasts, Liberty International.The process has been remarkably smooth for such a complicated transaction, helped by the clear demarcation of Capital & Counties (CapCo) and Capital Shopping Centres (CSC), and the fact that the split makes sense in offering investors a choice between the two.Whether life remains as untroubled after the demerger is open to question, however, given potential short-term buffeting from shareholders looking to buy in and out of each on preferences over the London schemes of CapCo or the shopping centres of CSC.The longer-term picture could be just as interesting. There is an argument that neither will be trading in the same shape in a year’s time given their attractions to consolidators in the UK market and predators from overseas. Ultimately, both companies have made themselves more vulnerable in being smaller vehicles holding purer sectoral assets.All eyes will first be on initial trading, in particular CapCo, which could suddenly be without support from investors from South Africa, where it will no longer be listed and so will fall under foreign investment allowances.This group mainly voted against the demerger at the EGM and could be the source of an overhang of stock. There are also the uncertain intentions of Westfield and Simon Property, the rival international shopping centre owners, which own close to 3 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.Morgan Stanley estimates that there could be as much as a 40 per cent share overhang from the combined South African investors, and from Westfield and Simon, if they decide to sell.In addition, some existing institutional investors will not be able to invest in CapCo after it loses its Reit status and drops out of the FTSE 100 and MSCI Standard indices. Investment company Exane calculates potential selling pressure of almost 30m shares, or about £39m of stock, should all funds sell immediately.However, it is likely that fears of a large overhang have been overcooked, even if a few days of volatility can be anticipated. There is no talk in the market of any large placements of shares ahead of trading, which could suggest that the South Africans may hang on for the time being. They have up to two years before they need to sell and, if any of them do, that is a door closed, given an inability to buy those shares back.More crucially, there has been a swing in sentiment towards central London development, which means that CapCo has picked a voguish time to list. CapCo has attractions in its London joint venture and ownership of Covent Garden, but the key will be the 23-acre Earls Court site, which could offer significant development profits over the long term. It is valued at £5.9m an acre, but analysts estimate that the site could increase to £15m-£25m an acre by the end of 2012 following residential planning permission. Morgan Stanley’s bull case is of £40m an acre, an 85 per cent growth in net asset value.Planning gains should appear towards the end of the two years that the South Africans can hold for – and some will no doubt do just that. CapCo will also have a new management team led by Ian Hawksworth that is eager to prove its credentials.Earls Court could also prove to be the honey for a potential takeover – particularly as the capital-intensive site needs new equity. The obvious buyer would be a sovereign state fund, given the longer-term returns, although overseas property companies, particularly from North America, could be interested. Unibail-Rodamco has been linked with a bid to bolster its own large conferences business, for example, and a continental buyer would benefit from sterling’s weakness.One rival chief executive laughed last week that CapCo was likely to start trading at a premium given the amount of takeover talk. He had been asked three times that morning if he was interested. His reply? “Maybe”.CSC, the owner of Liberty’s prime UK malls, will remain in all indices, meaning there will be little technical pressure on trading. It has its own attractions in becoming more of a cash cow for investors with a better earnings yield as a result of the demerger.Again, the company may have suitors. Westfield and Simon can be assumed to be interested in the malls from when they began buying stock in Liberty. It becomes manageable also for the likes of Land Securities or British Land, looking to make a mark on the recovery cycle. Gossip linked London & Stamford with a reverse takeover only a few months ago.The last big European real estate demerger was of Rodamco, which split four ways. All ended with new ownerships, albeit it took eight years before the European business was eventually merged with Unibail. There are similarities between the European business of Rodamco and CSC, given their prime retail portfolios that would be very difficult to replicate given planning restrictions.There would have to be a big premium to NAV, of course, and that is rare in the property sector. But some could feel that it is better to move soon than miss out in a few years’ time should values continue to recover.dan.thomas@ft.com
50;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-04-14T22:12:47Z;Simon offers to invest $2.5bn in GGP;;Simon Property Group has joined forces with the hedge fund run by John Paulson in a restructured bid to invest in bankrupt US mall owner General Growth Properties. Simon – which in February made a $10bn offer to buy GGP outright– has changed its proposal to reflect the structure of a rival proposal from Canadian fund Brookfield Asset Management.Brookfield teamed up with hedge fund Pershing Square, an investor in GGP, and Fairholme Capital Management with a March offer to recapitalise the owner of 200 shopping malls on a standalone basis.Its proposal envisaged splitting GGP into two distinct entities on its emergence from bankruptcy, valuing the company’s equity at $15 a share.Simon’s latest salvo in the battle for GGP mirrors its rival’s approach.It on Wednesday offered to invest $2.5bn in GGP’s reorganisation, with a $1bn co-investment from Paulson & Co, the fund known for its prescient and lucrative bets against the subprime mortgage market.Simon invited Brookfield’s partners, Pershing and Fairholme, to invest alongside it in GGP’s recapitalisation.It is already seeking out alternative investors to contribute up to about $2.9bn and has offered to backstop the investment under its plan if required.David Simon, chief executive of Simon, said in a letter to Adam Metz, the chief executive of GGP, that its proposal was now “very substantially more favourable” to GGP and its equityholders.”Meanwhile, Simon is offering to invest without the warrants that would be granted to Brookfield’s investment partners under their deal.Simon estimated that the benefit to GGP’s shareholders from eliminating the warrants could reach $895m, or $2.75 a share.One person close to the thinking of the Brookfield consortium disputed that valuation and said that having a significant rival as a top shareholder was an unattractive prospect which could raise anti-trust concerns. To attempt to mitigate this, Simon has pledged to limit its voting interest in GGP to 20 per cent of the outstanding shares.A majority of GGP’s board members would be independent under the Simon proposal.Simon would be able to nominate three members to the GGP board, who would not vote on certain issues such as acquisitions or disposals in areas close to Simon’s own properties.A bankruptcy hearing is scheduled this month to consider the competiting merits of the proposals for GGP.GGP said on Wednesday night that its board would study the proposal. Brookfield declined to comment.Shares in GGP fell slightly and were trading at $16.04 in the morning in New York.Meanwhile, the rival bidders for GGP have been seeking financial support from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and Asia, with Simon said by people familar with the matter to have talked to groups such as the Qatar Investment Authority.
51;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-03-14T22:00:48Z;US mall bidders eye SWF support;;The rival bidders for General Growth Properties, the bankrupt owner of some of the most high-profile shopping malls in the US, are seeking financial support from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and Asia, according to people familiar with the matter.The talks between the bidders and the foreign investors remain in the early stages but highlight the growing risk appetite of the world’s leading SWFs as well as their interest in finding bargains in the beleaguered US commercial property market.With Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management vying for control of GGP’s portfolio of 200 malls, “several of the larger sovereign funds are working with both parties,” said Guy Metcalfe, head of real estate investment banking for Morgan Stanley.The GGP battle began this year when Simon made a $10bn offer for the company. GGP’s board rejected that and put together a recapitalisation plan under which the mall owner would receive about $6.5bn in additional capital from Brookfield, Fairholme Capital Management and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square hedge fund.Simon has been talking to SWFs such as the Qatar Investment Authority about contributing to its bid, people familiar with the matter said. Blackstone is also expected to join forces with Simon and may turn to investors such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for additional financial firepower.Brookfield is likely to raise money for the deal from at least some of the SWFs that have invested in its $5.5bn distressed real estate opportunity fund, which was set up for opportunities such as GGP, the people familiar with the matter say.The distressed fund’s investors – each of which contributed a minimum of $500m – include China Investment Corporation, the Australian Fund for the Future, Government Investment Corp of Singapore and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, a quasi-SWF. CIC has signed a separate confidentiality agreement, according to people close to the matter, indicating it might join a GPP bid.Mr Metcalfe said the potential involvement of additional investors reflected the “size of the deal and the quality of the assets”. He said: “The younger funds [such as CIC and the Kuwait Investment Authority] especially are under-allocated to real estate and have no performance or legacy issues. It is a unique opportunity.”Simon, Brookfield, CIC, GIC and QIA declined to comment.
52;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-03-09T23:22:26Z;Liberty demerger heralds new era;Two new copmpanies to emerge;Liberty International’s proposed demerger of its £6.1bn property empire marks the beginning of a new era for the UK real estate investment trust sector since its inception in 2007.Two new companies are expected to start trading on the London Stock Exchange as early as this summer: Capital Shopping Centres (CSC), a mall-owning Reit expected to have a market capitalisation of £2bn, and Capital & Counties (CapCo), which will own the London estate and developments around Covent Garden and Earls Court, with a capitalisation of about £1bn.Support for the move has been voiced by shareholders, underlined by a strong share price performance since the news emerged last month. However, the shares fell 19p to 487½p on Tuesday on the back of weaker-than-expected full-year results.Patrick Burgess, Liberty chairman, says the move is in response to a changing approach to investment in real estate, both in the equity and property markets, which were requiring greater focus and more active management.“[The two companies] will be positioned to execute their own strategic plans, engaging with investors who will be able to select their individual weightings to each of the businesses,” he says.Liberty reported a net asset value of 464p for 2009, down from 745p at the end of December 2008. There was a loss before tax of £329m, down from £2.7bn the previous year. Liberty’s properties fell by 10.6 per cent in value over 2009, with its UK shopping centres down by 10.4 per cent and CapCo by 7.8 per cent.The decline in these portfolios reversed in the second half of last year, and investors are betting that both sides of the business will continue to recover.On paper, Liberty has engineered a clean split, with shareholders set to retain existing Liberty shares under the name of CSC and gain one new share in CapCo. CSC will own an investment and development portfolio of £5bn, including Lakeside in Thurrock, and the MetroCentre in Gateshead with a NAV per share of 339p.David Fischel, chief executive and an architect of the demerger, will head the Reit, which will also have a listing in Johannesburg.“We haven’t encountered anyone in the UK who does not think this is a good idea,” he says. “We have been through a tough two years and it’s now about making our strong centres even stronger.”Mr Burgess will remain chairman. CSC will also own Liberty’s Indian and US assets, though it is set to sell the £368m US group to Equity One, a Miami-based Reit. The dividend is expected to be 15p in 2010.CapCo will lose its Reit status owing to higher exposure to development, in particular the revamp of Earls Court. It will own the conference business, as well as properties around Covent Garden, as part of its £1.2bn estate. CapCo is expected to pay a dividend of 1.5p in 2010.Ian Hawksworth, managing director of CapCo, will become chief executive. Ian Durant, finance director of Liberty, will be chairman.Earls Court will need considerable expenditure for its development programme, certainly more than covered by income from Covent Garden and the Great Capital Partnership, the £218m joint venture with Great Portland Estates. There is speculation that both companies could tap shareholders for cash, and CapCo could also seek additional debt or a joint venture partner.Liberty’s shareholders will be able to choose which part of the property market they favour – relatively low-risk shopping centre investment, or longer-term development opportunities in Earls Court and Covent Garden.Land Securities, the UK’s largest Reit, attempted to demerge in 2007,arguing at the time that it would create more value for shareholders. However, it had a single large securitised debt facility, which would have needed to be broken up and refinanced at the point when liquidity in the debt markets disappeared. Liberty’s debt is secured on individual assets, however, which can be separated into the two businesses.All third-party consents, including from lenders, have been obtained except approval from the South African authorities. Rothschild and BofA Merrill Lynch are advisers and brokers. UBS is also joint broker. Demerger costs were estimated at £11.3m.The proposal has also received support from analysts. Harm Meijer, analyst at JPMorgan, says it makes sense, although adds that potential valuation gains and merger benefits are priced into shares.Mike Prew, Nomura analyst, says this will provide investors with a focused way to invest in either UK regional shopping centres or the cyclical London development sector at their own discretion.The move will also revive speculation about interest from overseas predators given the presence of Simon Property Group, the US retail property company, on both registers.Sir Donald Gordon, life president and the largest shareholder with 15 per cent, will keep his stake in each, retaining the kingmaker role he has played since building up the company over the past 30 years.
53;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-02-26T01:10:14Z;Liberty in talks to sell US malls;;Liberty International, the UK’s largest shopping mall owner, is in talks to sell its $560m (£368m) US shopping centre business to a Miami-based real estate investment trust as the next step in its planned demerger.Liberty is in advanced talks with Equity One, a large US retail owner, to sell its property business based in California. Liberty is believed to be structuring the deal to trade the properties in return for equity in the US group, rather than cash, which would give the UK Reit a stake in any growth of the business.Such a deal structure is expected to be more tax efficient for Liberty.The company this month confirmed to the Stock Exchange an FT report that it would separate into two businesses– a £2bn shopping centre owner and a £1bn London-focused development business.The transaction requires several third-party approvals and the company is expected to provide more information with its results next month.At its interim results last summer, Liberty said that steps would be taken to reduce US exposure. The company was linked this week with the sale of the portfolio to Vornado, a rival US Reit, although those close to the negotiations say that was incorrect.Instead, it had been negotiating the sale to Equity One, with a deal hoped to be finalised next quarter.The value of the business at June 30 2009 was £368m, representing about 6 per cent of Liberty’s portfolio. The US group, which owns retail malls and is called Capital and Counties USA, generated net rental income of £12.4m for Liberty, partly owing to favourable currency translation.The total portfolio comprises 2.5m sq ft, of which 93 per cent is occupied by area. It has its headquarters in San Francisco.Liberty said last summer that it expected rental and valuation deterioration in the US and was exploring methods to mitigate exposure.Liberty is also looking at the future of its Chinese and Indian businesses.The demerger process has been broadly welcomed by analysts and shareholder groups, given the prospect of greater strength through specialisation of its business units.Earlier this week, Harm Meijer, an analyst at JPMorgan, said that a demerger made sense, adding that it was conceivable that both new companies could be taken over by one of the large retail owners on its share register, such as Simon Property and Westfield.
54;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-02-17T01:59:45Z;Simon Property bids $10bn for rival;;Simon Property, the largest US mall operator, said on Tuesday it had made a $10bn offer to acquire General Growth Properties, its big rival that fell into bankruptcy last year.The bid for General Growth, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, is likely to mean windfall profits to holders of $7bn in unsecured debt who bought in at distressed levels and an even greater possible windfall for shareholders. It is also expected to be the opening salvo in a heated contest for the Chicago-based mall owner.If accepted, Simon’s bid means that unsecured holders will receive the full face value of the debt and all the accrued interest while shareholders will receive about $9 per share, $6 of that in cash. That would give the company a market capitalisation of $2.8bn.Still, one main shareholder immediately dismissed Simon’s offer as “a low-ball bid to get the stock down”. Several others say they intend to hold rather than sell at the price on offer from Simon. Because creditors are being made whole, the fate of the company is largely in the hands of shareholders.The share price of General Growth rose 27 per cent to $12.02 in over-the-counter trading on the expectation that other bidders might now come in.“Everyone thinks that this is the first offer but it won’t be the last offer,” says one holder of the debt who came in when it was trading at 30 cents on the dollar last summer.The most likely second bidder would be Brookfield Properties, which holds a significant stake in the unsecured debt and has repeatedly expressed interest in a retail platform for shopping malls in the US, according to a person familiar with the matter.Because Brookfield already holds as much as $1bn in the debt, it could afford to pay a more generous price to shareholders and still put less capital into an offer than Simon’s bid.Both Brookfield and Simon have been holding talks with potential partners. People familiar with the Simon bid say those talks have involved sovereign wealth funds in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.Meanwhile, last summer, Brookfield created a $5bn global distressed real estate consortium with international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds that could help finance a bid. Brookfield declined to comment.Other potential bidders could include Vornado Realty Trust and Westfield Shopping Centers.David Simon, chairman and chief executive, said, “Our offer provides much-needed certainty to conclude General Growth’s protracted reorganisation process. We are confident it is the best option for all General Growth constituencies and far superior to any other third-party proposal or stand-alone plan that could be completed.”Simon added that it had not received “a substantive response to this proposal” and warned that “our offer is not open-ended”.
55;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-02-16T20:52:36Z;General Growth Properties;Investors are right to be eyeing a higher price tag;Simon Property Group’s $10bn offer to buy bankrupt US mall owner General Growth Properties could prompt others still browsing to reach for their wallets. With $7bn going to pay unsecured creditors in full, shareholders are left with about $9 a share, roughly in line with recent trading. A third of that consideration is an ownership interest in General Growth’s beaten-down land assets – smart given Simon’s lack of interest in land – with the remainder in cash or stock. The expectation of more to come, however, boosted General Growth shares by more than a quarter to above $12.Simon says the shares, which had more than doubled in the past three months before this latest leap, already included a bid premium. The actions of a bankruptcy judge means creditors’ interests hold some sway.But investors are right to be eyeing a higher price tag. In the concentrated US malls market, General Growth – the second largest owner after Simon itself – offers a portfolio that is near impossible to replicate, either for a strategic buyer or for other interested parties such as Canadian asset manager Brookfield. Putting together two large mall owners could necessitate asset sales, but Simon could also take substantial (though unspecified) costs out of the combined group and work General Growth’s 200-strong portfolio harder on the revenue side.Hedge fund Pershing Square, which sits on about a quarter of General Growth’s equity and a seat on the board, will push shareholders’ cause. The aim is to shift General Growth’s valuation closer to where the market values the portfolio of Simon itself. The latter appears to have the means and motivation to go higher. If the court next week grants General Growth more time in exclusive control of its reorganisation, Simon may have to.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
56;SPG;Simon Property Group;2010-02-05T22:29:41Z;Wall St volatile after mixed US jobs report;;US stocks see-sawed on Friday after a mixed monthly jobs report created further uncertainty about the pace of the economic recovery.While the unemployment rate fell to a five-month low, the labour department also reported a surprise decline in January payrolls.Futures initially turned positive on the data but the market continued to fluctuate.After dropping 1.8 per cent at one point, the S&P 500 staged a dramatic last-minute recovery, closing 0.3 per cent higher at 1,066.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 10,012.23 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher at 2,141.12.On Thursday, Wall Street suffered its worst daily losses since April last year after fears over European sovereign debt and disappointing weekly unemployment data unnerved investors.The Vix index, which tracks market volatility through option prices and is known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped more than 20 per cent on Thursday and edged very slightly higher on Friday.Over the course of the week, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent, the Dow lost 0.5 per cent and the Nasdaq was 0.3 per cent lower. The benchmark index has fallen 4.4 per cent since the start of the year.Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said he believed the market was facing a correction of at least 10 per cent as the earnings season continues to weigh on investors’ confidence. “As people have come to accept the idea that we’re in recovery, their expectations have risen.“There’s been a tendency when companies have reported – unless they’ve shown not only good solid earnings progress but improved revenues or business fundamentals – for investors to be disappointed.“Expectations may be a little high here relative to the economy and what companies are able to deliver. And because the market has run up so much, this is pushing us into a general correction.”Tyson Foods helped lift the market higher, rising 4.7 per cent to $14.65 after the company swung to a first-quarter profit.The results were also better than had been expected, thanks in part to lower grain costs for its chickens.Simon Property Group, the country’s largest owner of shopping malls, posted a sharp decline in quarterly profit due to writedowns and lower occupancy rates.However, the results were also better than expected, helping to lift its shares 5.6 per cent to $73.36.American Axle & Manufacturing, an auto parts supplier, initially rose after cost cuts enabled the company to post a quarterly profit. The group, which narrowly avoided bankruptcy in September, gave an optimistic forecast for this year. However, the shares were later down 10.6 per cent to $8.42.Airgas showed one of the market’s steepest gains, surging 40 per cent to $60.96.Air Products and Chemicals, Airgas’s rival, launched an unsolicited $5.1bn cash bid for the company in an effort to become the country’s largest industrial gas group.Meanwhile, shares in Air Products fell 6.9 per cent to $68.64.Aetna posted a lower quarterly profit than analysts had been expecting due to higher costs at its disability business.However, after early weakness, its shares were up 1.3 per cent at $29.61.In the retail sector, Coach lost 0.4 per cent to $34.32 after Goldman Sachs cut the country’s largest maker of luxury leather handbags to “neutral” from “buy”.Retailers were in focus earlier this week as companies posted their January sales figures.The 29 retailers that posted their monthly revenues recorded an average sales rise of 3.3 per cent after analysts had been expecting a 2.5 per cent increase, according to Thomson Reuters data.
57;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Mall investors set for bonanza as finance recovers;;Hedge funds and other investors now stand to make billions of dollars from their holdings in bankrupt US mall owner General Growth Properties, underscoring the extent of the recent rebound in financial markets, people familiar with the matter say.Among the biggest potential winners is William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, which is sitting on a paper profit of more than $800m on investments in the debt and equity of GGP, according to people familiar with Mr Ackman’s fund. Other investors that stand to make big profits on holdings in the high-profile retail property owner include Centerbridge Partners, Elliott Associates, Goldman Sachs, John Paulson’s Paulson & Co and York Capital, the people said.“General Growth is a fantastic example of the speed with which real-estate finance is coming back,” said Bob Steers, co-chairman of real estate investment firm Cohen & Steers, which has not invested in General Growth.GGP, owner of malls including Boston’s Faneuil Hall Marketplace and Honolulu’s Ala Moana Center, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April. It has about $22bn in senior secured debt and $6bn in debt not backed by collateral.During the darkest days of the financial crisis, the value of GGP’s unsecured debt fell below 10 cents on the dollar. That debt has soared to 95 cents as markets have revived amid unprecedented stimulus efforts. Equity in the mall owner, which is traded over the counter, has risen to about $7 a share from less than a dollar.GGP commanded a market value of about $10bn when Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. Two months later, GGP shares were worth just $100m. The revival of GGP’s fortunes is helping to validate the views of investors who reckoned that the company was essentially brought down by a panic in the mortgage-backed securities markets in which it raised financing.“It is a classic good-company, bad-balance-sheet operation,” said Jeff Aronson, co-founder of Centerbridge Partners.Mr Ackman began accumulating his GGP position in November 2008, said a person familiar with the fund. He spent $50m on stock – priced at under a $1 a share at the time – that is now worth $560m. He invested $100m in unsecured debt now worth $400m. Centerbridge holds $300m in GGP unsecured debt, purchased when it was trading for 30-odd cents on the dollar, a person familiar with the fund said.Last week, lenders restructured $9bn of GGP commercial mortgage-backed securities. In return for lengthening the maturity of the debt, lenders received fees and tighter documentation. Some analysts believe that GGP could have avoided a bankruptcy filing if it had been able to extend the maturities of its debt earlier.Simon Property also said last week it hired advisers as it considers a possible bid for GGP. Such a transaction could be valued at up to $30bn if Simon were to bid for all of GGP’s holdings, according to a person familiar with the potential deal.The GGP rally is also certain to stir the debate over whether the Federal Reserve’s low-interest rate policy is working – or is instead encouraging the formation of new bubbles in the markets. In last week’s Global Data Watch, JPMorgan said: “The recovery trade is largely complete, leaving us in an asset reflation phase.”
58;SPG;Simon Property Group;2009-11-19T00:30:48Z;Simon eyes General Growth’s mall portfolio;;Simon Property, a mall owner and property investment trust, has hired advisers to explore a possible bid for rival General Growth Properties, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.If Simon decides to bid for GGP’s entire mall portfolio, the transaction value could be between $25bn and $30bn, according to one person familiar with the potential deal.As Simon considers its options, its interest might trigger other potential bids, investors and analysts said. Reports suggesting Simon was interested led to higher prices for General Growth debt. General Growth shares, which trade over the counter, also rose.“Risk-taking is coming back to the commercial real estate sector but only for those with liquidity,” said Robert Steers, co-chairman of Cohen & Steers, a property investment firm.Commercial real estate has failed to respond to the Federal Reserve’s low interest rate policy. A bid for General Growth would fuel hopes that the market is poised to recover – although Simon would be a strategic, rather than a financial, investor.Any buyer of General Growth assets would have to satisfy creditors that its offer was better than a restructuring plan offered by the company. General Growth has about $22bn in senior secured debt and about $6bn in unsecured debt. The company has been planning to convert almost all its unsecured debt to equity when it emerges from bankruptcy protection. It would then go public again and pay back senior lenders from the proceeds of that listing.Analysts speculated that Simon would be interested in General Growth’s more high-quality malls. Other potential bidders could include Brookfield, a Canadian property firm that has said it is interested in a US retail platform, analysts said.Simon has retained Lazard investment bank and the Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Krantz law firm as advisers.
59;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Wall Street slumps after disappointing data;;"A rally among bond insurers was not enough to lift Wall Street out of the red on Wednesday after the release of disappointing housing figures.The recovery of the housing market in the US was shown to be more fragile than previously thought when data revealed that the number of new houses built last month had fallen for the first time since April.The technology sector also led the market lower after Autodesk, the world’s biggest maker of design software, forecast fourth-quarter profits below estimates. The group said its recovery could be hindered by continued job losses, sending its shares down 10.4 per cent to $24.20.However, the financial sector was buoyed by Ambac Financial, which eased market concerns over its balance sheet.The second-largest US bond insurer said the statutory capital of its main unit was well above a regulatory minimum at the end of the third quarter.Last week, the group said it might have to seek bankruptcy protection if it could not solve its liquidity problems, sending its shares down more than
30 per cent.But Ambac shares soared 44.3 per cent to $1.01 on Wednesday and MBIA, the world’s largest bond insurer, jumped 10.1 per cent to $3.82.After brief gains in the morning, the S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,109.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 10,426.31 and the Nasdaq was down 0.5 per cent to 2,193.14.Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage, said: “The housing starts [data] was not expected to be that weak, but there is a lot of complacency in the market and that is being interpreted through implied volatility, which is nearing year-to-date lows.”The Vix, an index that gauges market volatility and investor anxiety, surged over the 80 points level in November last year but has fallen steadily since. The index dropped a further 3.4 per cent to 21.64 on Wednesday.The market was also torn between a series of deals, which helped to lift sentiment, and continued pessimism in the consumer discretionary sector.Hershey and Ferrero International said they might enter the bidding for Cadbury, the British confectionery group that is the subject of a hostile bid from Kraft Foods. Hershey fell 2 per cent to $37.63 and Kraft 1.4 per cent to $27.26.American Express also announced that it had bought Revolution Money, an internet-based payment platform, for $300m.The company was set up in 2007 by Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL. American Express shares edged 0.5 per cent higher to $41.57.Shares in Delta Air Lines dropped 1.8 per cent to $7.76 after the airline and its partners offered a $1bn aid package to Japan Airlines, which is facing possible bankruptcy.The deal is intended to lure Asia’s biggest carrier out of a potential alliance with American Airlines.Shares in AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, lost 3.7 per cent to $5.77.But discount retailers weighed on the market.Shares in Target, the second-largest discounter in the US, slipped 1.5 per cent to $47.87 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral” from “buy”. The company’s shares lost more than 3 per cent on Tuesday after the retailer gave a cautious outlook for the upcoming holiday season.BJ’s Wholesale Club reported lower sales from its third quarter than had been expected, pushing its shares down 2 per cent to $35.63.The retailer remains popular with shoppers seeking to save money by buying in bulk. But BJ’s and its rivals are facing tough comparisons given that last year’s sales were boosted by high petrol prices and food price inflation.But the retailer Perry Ellis International reported third-quarter profit above expectations due to its aggressive cost-cutting. Its shares gained 0.7 per cent to $14.99 as it raised forecasts for next year.Chico’s, the women’s casual clothing chain, also beat estimates for the third quarter, sending its shares up 8.8 per cent to $14.67.General Growth Properties, the bankrupt shopping mall owner, surged 36.3 per cent to $5.82 after reports that rival Simon Property Group was considering buying assets of the company.Simon also gained after the announcement, rising 4.7 per cent to $75.58."
60;SPG;Simon Property Group;2009-08-06T19:27:09Z;Turnround hope pushes Lloyds to year high;;A short squeeze pushed Lloyds Banking Group into pole position on Thursday as the FTSE 100 climbed for the first day in three.Lloyds was up 12.3 per cent to 104¾p, its high of the year, as brokers including UBS and Goldman Sachs said hopes of a recovery look well founded.“Unlike most European banks, we think Lloyds can claim the worst is behind it,” said UBS, which repeated “buy” advice.“Falling impairments, improving margins and declining costs represent a powerful cocktail and is the investment case that Lloyds offers on its return journey.”The view was far from unanimous. BNP Paribas dismissed Lloyds’ prediction that margins would recover in 2010 as a “leap of faith,” while Panmure Gordon said the optimism may be “a typical midsummer uplift in spirits and asset prices”.Lloyds shares have gained 24 per cent since Wednesday’s better than feared results. Traders said the sharp reaction was at least partly driven by several London-based hedge funds scrambling to close short positions.Some were hoping for a similar reaction in Royal Bank of Scotland, which rose 9.8 per cent to 52p before its first-half results, due this morning.The move put the government in profit on its RBS stake for the first time. The 70 per cent holding was bought at an average price of 50½p.Meanwhile, Barclays rose 5.2 per cent to 354p after shareholders approved the sale of its investment management unit.Real estate companies followed the banks higher in spite of a sector downgrade from Mike Prew, Nomura’s influential property analyst.British Land rose 7 per cent to 597¾p and Hammerson put on 2.1 per cent to 384½p, while Land Securities was up 5.4 per cent to 610½p amid vague talk of stake building.“Real estate values are stabilising but rents are still in mid-recession,” Mr Prew said. “We are mindful that after the 1990s crash, real estate prices suffered a relapse with two years of soggy pricing until rental growth was comprehensively restored some two years later.”The financial and property sectors helped underpin the FTSE 100, which rose 43.4 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 4,690.53.Shire was up 4.5 per cent to 960½p after Merrill Lynch upgraded the drugmaker from “underperform” to “buy”.The risk to earnings from generic competition looks to have played out, Merrill said, while Shire’s key hyperactivity treatment should benefit from a back-to-school sales boost.Forecast-beating figures lifted Thomson Reuters, up 6.1 per cent to £19.93, and Unilever, which gained 5.4 per cent to £16.29.There were also better than expected figures from Cobham, lately the subject of speculation about possible corporate action. The defence and aerospace engineer was up 5 per cent to 187½p. Sector rotation put pressure on the utilities, with Severn Trent losing 4.5 per cent to 934p and United Utilities off 3.2 per cent to 438½p.The moves were in contrast to bonds, which rose sharply in reaction to the Bank of England’s injection of a further £50bn into the economy via its quantitative easing programme.Bodycote, up 2.4 per cent to 163¾p, was helped by vague gossip of another approach from Sulzer. In 2007, Bodycote rejected offers from the Swiss industrials group of up to 344½p per share.Shares in Bodycote have rallied 32 per cent since its interim results last week, matching a rally among operationally geared peers such as Cookson, which was up a further 1.9 per cent to 379½p, and GKN, which closed steady at 110p.Vectura led the mid-cap leaderboard, gaining 10.1 per cent to 84p after Citigroup added the asthma drugs developer to its “buy” list.Millennium & Copthorne gained 10.1 per cent to 84p after the hotelier said it saw signs of stability returning to its main markets.The news helped support InterContinental Hotels, which was up 2.8 per cent to 742p in spite of talk it might cut its dividend when interim results are announced on Tuesday.Cosalt surged on Thursday after the marine safety company announced an £18.9m fundraising.Investors also welcomed news that David Ross, the former deputy chairman of Carphone Warehouse, was set to become chairman following the capital raising.Mr Ross, who owns 15 per cent of Cosalt, resigned all his directorships last year after failing to declare that he had pledged stock against personal loans.Cosalt shares surged 68 per cent to 16p.Gulf Keystone, which has regularly been mooted as a takeover target, surged by 113 per cent to 26½p after test results from part of its Kurdistan prospect showed between 300m and 500m barrels of oil in place.Lavendon, the cherry picker rental group, rose 17.4 per cent to 175p after it bought most of the assets of EPL Access, a competitor that had entered administration last month.Rebel shareholders led by Vine Street Capital blocked a management buy-out at Spark Ventures, the technology investment company formerly known as New Media Spark.Spark said after the market closed that its non-executive directors had pulled resolutions to vote on the buy-out from Friday’s general meeting. The stock ended unchanged at 7¾p.Mecom, the newspaper publisher, lost 11.1 per cent to 102¼p after reporting advertising revenues fell 22 per cent in the first half.Drugs developer Vernalis climbed 11 per cent to 93p after signing a licensing deal with GlaxoSmithKline.GW Pharmaceuticals, the maker of pharmaceutical cannabis, advanced 7.9 per cent to 82p on news of a £6.6m share sale.Great Point Partners, the US specialist healthcare investor, bought 7.55m new shares at 78p apiece in response to an “unsolicited request”, GW said.M&G Investment Management, GW’s leading shareholder, was also allocated stock and warrants at the same price to avoid being diluted.
61;SPG;Simon Property Group;2008-10-14T20:42:35Z;Capital injection plan fails to lift Wall Street;;The fresh $250bn plan to shore up US banks bolstered hard-hit financial stocks on Tuesday but failed to lift the broader market amid heightened concerns of global economic slowdown.Disappointing third-quarter figures from PepsiCo and, moreover, its failure to provide guidance for next year reinforced Wall Street concerns that corporate earnings would be badly hurt by the effect of the financial crisis.PepsiCo, which plans to cut 3,300 jobs as part of a plan to save more than $1.2bn over three years, tumbled 11.9 per cent to $54.40 while peers Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple lost 7.5 per cent to $543.73 and 3.3 per cent to $23, respectively.Consumer staples – normally a defensive haven – were one of the biggest sectoral laggards, down 2.6 per cent overall.After another volatile session, the S&P 500 lost 0.5 per cent at 998.01, having earlier risen as much as 4.1 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.8 per cent at 9,310.99The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3.5 per cent at 1,779.01. Intel slipped 6.3 per cent to $15.93 ahead of results that were due after the bell. Microsoft fell 5.5 per cent to $24.10 after Credit Suisse cut its forecasts and Google lost 4.8 per cent to $362.71 after Barclays cut its price target from $600 to $542.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 8.8 per cent to 59.81, which continued to indicate signs of severe distress.“You’d be delirious to say all of a sudden that this situation has been resolved,” said Joe Cusick, analyst at OptionsXpress, who added the reaction to the PepsiCo numbers showed traders were “starting to focus on the earnings and economic outlook.” A slew of other corporate results are due in coming days.Financials were the stand-out winners on Tuesday, up 6.4 per cent overall. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – surged 16.4 per cent to $26.53, 10.7 per cent to $122.90 and 18.2 per cent $18.62, respectively. There were also tentative signs on Tuesday that the paralysis in credit markets, which reached historic levels had begun to ease.Bucking the trend, JPMorgan Chase fell 3.1 per cent to $40.71, weighed down as Barclays cut its third-quarter earnings estimate ahead of results due today. Some analysts also said that the government plan may be of less benefit to the group, which has thus far appeared more resilient to the crisis than rivals.Regional banks boasted the biggest gains, up 14.3 per cent. The Treasury confirmed that it was also prepared to plough money into a wide range of lenders in addition to the nine institutions from whom it has secured participation. Keycorp and National City surged 54.3 per cent to $11.97 and 34.8 per cent to $3.10 respectively.Meanwhile, General Motors and Ford soared as much as 22.6 per cent and 24.3 per cent, respectively.The hard-hit car groups, subject to merger speculation, later retreated to stand 0.5 per cent higher at $6.54 and 2.5 per cent higher at $2.45. Concern over the likely success of a merger with each other, or Chrysler, offset hopes that the Treasury could purchase auto loans under the remit of its financial sector rescue plan.Most non-financial sectors posted declines.

62;SPG;Simon Property Group;2008-08-26T21:27:06Z;Foreign rivals declare stakes in Liberty;;Two of the world’s largest retail real estate companies, Australia’s Westfield and US developer Simon Property group, have declared stakes in Liberty International, strengthening the prospect of a bid for the UK FTSE-100 retail property owner.Westfield on Tuesday said that it had built a stake of just under 3 per cent in Liberty, days after Simon declared a holding of 3.5 per cent.Simon, the biggest US public real estate company, raised its position to 4.2 per cent on Tuesday, and is expected to declare a larger stake of more than 5 per cent before the end of the week.Westfield bought 10.7m shares in June and July at an average price of 835p.The company said that the stake was being held for “investment purposes” and declined to comment further.Simon, likewise, has refused to comment on its intentions, although it is unusual for the company to build indirect stakes in rival developers. This is also its first investment in the UK property market.Analysts say that the chance of an eventual take-over bid appears high.There was speculation on Tuesday that Simon and Westfield could be working in tandem on a bid, with one analyst remarking that they had now both “pulled up a seat at the table”.Westfield and Simon have previously worked together on takeover attempts in the US of Rodamco North America, Taubman and Mills.A potential price of around £12 per share was being talked about in the market on Tuesday, a premium to the last stated net asset value of £10.95. Shares in Liberty closed up 65p at £10.10.Westfield has been linked with Liberty in the past, potentially with the support of Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC. Buying Liberty – owner of London’s Covent Garden shopping development – would give Simon a springboard into the UK market, a feat which may be more difficult to achieve without a deal.The companies know each other well, helped by friendships between the dominant personalities at the top, Liberty’s Sir Donald Gordon, founder and life president of the company, David Simon and Westfield’s Lowy family.Liberty has long been mooted as a takeover target, partly because Sir Donald still owns 21 per cent.Sir Donald has intimated that an offer above net asset value could tempt him, and he would bring a loyal band of South African investors to the table.Liberty is one of the most expensive stocks in the UK property sector, trading at near parity to net asset value, but both companies could probably afford the deal, according to analysts.
63;SPG;Simon Property Group;2008-08-26T19:07:38Z;Imperial deal points to a richer route out of Russia;;There are two ways for the west’s oilmen to exit Russia. The Robert Dudley route: by the backdoor, pursued by bear, for an exile’s existence “Somewhere in Central Europe”. Or the Peter Levine route: via the red carpet, with £90m of spending money, for the riviera of your choice.Yet the trajectory of Imperial Energy, founded by Mr Levine, is not a straight line from Aim to fortune. Less than a year ago, a fierce stand-off with the Russian regulator was followed by an approach from Gazprom to buy a minority stake. At the time, you might even have bet that Mr Levine’s fate would match that of TNK-BP’s Mr Dudley, condemned by a politicised power struggle to run the company from a secret location.Now India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp has launched an agreed bid, are there any other surprises in store for Mr Levine?Imperial’s chairman was careful on Tuesday to make frequent reference to fat ladies not yet having sung. His caution is natural for a man who as recently as spring was shunned by bank lenders and forced to raise funds for Imperial through a rights issue. But only two events could delay the final curtain. One would be a decision by the Russian authorities to block state-controlled ONGC on antitrust or anti-Indian grounds. Another would be the emergence of an even fatter lady in the form of China’s Sinopec, with a higher bid.The first is the least likely. Assuming a large part of behind-the-scenes manoeuvring towards yesterday’s announcement must have taken place between two nuclear powers, there would be more at stake than Mr Levine’s retirement pot if Moscow imposed a last-minute veto. Still, stranger things have happened.As for the second, Mr Levine and the Imperial directors have pledged their shares irrevocably to ONGC, as has Baillie Gifford, Imperial’s biggest shareholder. But the latter has reserved the right to switch allegiance if an offer emerges at a 10 per cent premium to ONGC’s, leaving the door ajar for the slim chance of a counter-bid.Imperial shares stand at a small discount to the offer price. One option for other investors would be to cash in now – if you first invested four years ago when the shares stood at 25p, that would be the safe way out. Others can afford to stay put in the hope of a final positive twist.They’re ready to talk shopGiven their business is based on opening stores, global retail developers form a pretty closed shop. The largest retail real estate companies know each other well, a relationship lubricated by friendship between the dominant personalities at the top.If it comes to deciding the future of Liberty International, Sir Donald Gordon – the South African entrepreneur who founded Liberty and still owns a 21 per cent stake – David Simon of Simon Property and Westfield’s Lowy family could all now have seats round the negotiating table.Sir Donald’s retirement in 2005 started the musical chairs, but if there is a deal to be had, it will come down to price rather than sentiment. The decline in the commercial property market is tempting potential buyers. Simon, which is expected to emerge with a 5 per cent stake in Liberty, had not dabbled before in the UK market.Sir Donald has previously intimated that an offer sufficiently above net asset value could tempt him and he would bring a loyal band of South African investors to the table. But Liberty is already one of the most expensive stocks in the UK property sector, trading near parity to net asset value. Compare Hammerson, another UK retail specialist. Even buoyed by takeover speculation around Liberty, its shares change hands at a discount of about 33 per cent to stated net asset value.Both Liberty’s potential suitors could probably afford to pay up for the privilege of owning (or, if they acted together, sharing) the house that Sir Donald built. The fact the wily South African deal-maker holds the keys is good for other Liberty shareholders. If it prompts the market to reassess its gloomy view of the prospects for other property companies, it could even be good for the sector as a whole.Buy-to-let-to-defaultJust as Lombard suggested last week, new data show lenders seem to be tightening their grip on buy-to-let landlords who show signs of financial fragility.According to Council of Mortgage Lenders statistics, the absolute number of possessions stayed low in the first half – still only 1,800 properties out of more than 1m buy-to-let mortgages outstanding – but the axe is falling earlier on landlords than it is on other borrowers in arrears. If you don’t like banks, you will still presume they’re heartless. Just bear in mind that they seem to be applying their lack of heart with increasing discrimination.Liberty: dan.thomas@ft.comandrew.hill@ft.comTo comment, visit www.ft.com/lombard
64;SPG;Simon Property Group;2008-08-25T19:47:50Z;Retailers’ woes hit real estate investors;;When Boscov’s filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, it was the latest in a slew of retailers to be pulled under as consumers have reined in their spending.But as the mid-range Pennsylvania retailer held closing sales at 10 of its 49 stores last week, the little-known company’s woes were a sign of how troubles facing US retailers will also hit investors in the buildings that house them.Simon Property Group and General Growth Properties, two major real estate investment trusts that between them own six of the malls in which the Boscov’s department stores sit, will struggle to fill the vacant space in a weak retail environment.There could also be problems for investors who hold Boscov’s debt. Boscov’s mortgages on seven of the stores that are closing were packaged up by Bank of America into a commercial mortgage backed security deal.Boscov’s is late in payments on the $117m in debt, according to Bloomberg data. If it defaults on the loans, owners of the lower classes of bonds will face losses, although Darryl Wheeler, an analyst at Citigroup does not expect them to be major.In total, Boscov’s has more than $1.53bn in outstanding loans spread through $52.75bn worth of CMBS deals, property data company Realpoint calculates, signalling how wide the company’s problems could spread, although it has not announced any other store closures. Boscov’s did not respond to calls for comment.Boscov’s bankruptcy emphasises the growing problems in retail property, which is expected to be the worst hit property sector outside of residential.“Boscov’s expanded too quickly,” said Mr Cardone. “Most of the problems [in retail property] come from over-aggressive expansion. We expect to see more of this.”Beyond Boscov’s a long list of companies such as gadget seller Sharper Image, discount women’s clothes store Steven and Barry’s and Linens N Things, a home furnishings chain, have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent months.Major retailers, such as Home Depot, Zales and Starbucks are also closing stores, and others such as JC Penney are holding back on renewing existing leases or store openings.The result is a market facing a flood of empty space, especially in many parts of the country where the housing boom was most pronounced, with vacancy rates rising to their highest since 1996 in the second quarter according to Reis.“Declines in retail sales in once-hot housing markets in Florida, Arizona, Nevada and Southern and Central California have been significant, and owners of malls in these regions could get more severely battered as a result,” said analysts at Green Street Advisors in a recent note.The rising vacancy and slowing demand for space is beginning to hit the businesses of public retail property investors.General Growth is delaying $500m of development because of the poor retail environment and difficulties securing credit, and recorded weaker than expected profits in the last quarter.“Now is not the best time to be opening new projects,” said John Bucksbaum, the company’s chief executive, after reporting its last results, spurring a sharp drop in the company’s shares.Overall, a rise in speculative building means the proportion of store space filled by tenants when construction is completed has slipped sharply from a historical average of more than 80 per cent to just over 60 per cent in the last two years, Reis reports.Prices for retail buildings have fallen 4 per cent since their peak in the third quarter of last year – less than the 11 per cent decline in office buildings – but Sam Chandan of Reis puts this down to the fact that wary buyers and lenders are only agreeing deals on the safest, best properties.This weak environment has helped drag down construction of shops, which is now falling at its fastest rate in nearly three decades, according to projections from McGraw Hill Construction. “What’s made it dramatic is how quick the decline has been,” said Bob Murray, of McGraw Hill.Mr Murray puts the speed of the slowdown down to the range of problems facing the industry – the credit crisis, the worst housing market since the Great Depression, rising inflation and a struggling economy – as well as greater transparency in property markets allowing a quicker correction.The decline in shop building comes after an extended period where developers raced to erect retail space to keep pace with residential building, and consumer spending grew fast fuelled by mounting personal debts often secured against the value of their homes.More store space was built in 2005 and 2007 than any other years since McGraw Hill’s records began in 1967.“The pace of development picked up as consumers used their home equity like ATMs, spending much of this newfound equity at the mall or neighbourhood shopping center,” says Ben Yang, an analyst at Green Street Advisors.
65;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Property powers Footsie higher;;Real estate stocks powered the London market higher as traders marked Liberty International as a potential bid target.Liberty jumped 8 per cent to 945p after Simon Property Group, the US shopping centre developer, disclosed a 3.45 per cent stake.“We believe the stake building should be taken seriously and underpins our view that UK property stocks own generally high quality assets with [long-term] value creation prospects,” JPMorgan said.Simon’s move heightened speculation that Donald Gordon, Liberty’s founder and former chairman, may sell his 22 per cent holding.By buying a stake, Simon could be signalling to Liberty management that it would be a serious buyer, JPMorgan said. Its analysts also saw potential for the US company to act as a white knight if Liberty had been approached by another developer, such as Westfield.British Land – in which the Singapore government this week raised its stake over 5 per cent – was up 6.2 per cent to 751½p. Hammerson gained 5.2 per cent to 918p.The FTSE 100 finished higher by 2.5 per cent, up 135.4 points to 5,505.6, helped by short covering ahead of the long weekend.Banks gained ground on the prospect that Lehman Brothers might be sold. State-run Korea Development Bank said it was studying options for investing in Lehman, and would not rule out making a hostile bid.Royal Bank of Scotland gained 5.4 per cent to 220¾p and Barclays was up 5.1 per cent to 326¾p. Lloyds TSB rose 7 per cent to 299½p, with stake-building talk rife, after 20m shares changed hands in a single clip.Among the miners, BHP Billiton took on 1.7 per cent to £16.98 after the Australian antitrust regulator identified the iron ore market as its only main concern regarding the proposed takeover of Rio Tinto.Rio, which is expected to give further details of its bid defence plan with interim results, was up 0.7 per cent to £51.79.Accounting software maker Sage Group inched higher by 1.4 per cent to 205½p after Intuit, its main rival in the US, said sales of its competing products had remained strong.On a more speculative tack, BT Grouppicked up 3.4 per cent to 167.8p as rumours about interest from Dubai were given another airing. Vague talk about a potential break in British Energy’s takeover stalemate with EDF helped it put on 1 per cent to 729p.Condom maker SSL International gained 6.2 per cent to 465p after Goldman Sachs analysts named it a potential takeover target.“We believe the recent pick-up in M&A activity is a positive signal,” said the broker. “It draws a line in the sand for asset valuations, shows managements are confident that asset prices are reasonable, implies some willingness among banks to lend – as many deals are debt-financed – and makes the risk/reward for shorting stocks less attractive.”Goldman also saw potential for predators to circle spread bettor IG Group, up 3.9 per cent to 340p, and Carphone Warehouse, 5.3 per cent firmer at 199p.Game Group – another stock on Goldman’s M&A list – gained 5.7 per cent to 261¼p after US peer GameStop boosted sales and earnings guidance for its year to January.“GameStop’s comments suggest continued market strength, and any further step-up in used game sales would clearly be a positive for Game margins and profit forecasts,” said RBS.Benfield led the mid-cap risers, up 27.5 per cent to 245½p after the reinsurer agreed a 350p bid from Aon.Michael Page was down 4.4 per cent to 357p, having tacked on 17.7 per cent this week amid hopes Adecco would sweeten its rejected 400p bid for the recruiter.Goldman downgraded Michael Page to “neutral” from “buy”. While Adecco has the wherewithal to increase its offer, it faces a significant challenge to win over the hearts and pockets of senior Page management, it said.
66;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Simon takes stake in UK rival Liberty;;Simon Property Group, the largest US public real estate company, has made its first investment in the UK with the unexpected acquisition of a 3.5 per stake in Liberty International, its UK shopping centre rival.The £120m stakebuilding by the US retail developer sparked rumours on Friday of an impending bid for Liberty, which has long been talked of as a target for an overseas property company.The rumours are partly because of the 21 per cent stake owned by Sir Donald Gordon, Liberty founder and life president, who is seen as a potential “kingmaker” in a deal if a suitable price is offered.On Friday, real estate analysts suggested that Simon was unlikely to mount a bid itself for Liberty – with which it has good relations – but that such a stake could help it facilitate a bid from a third party.Simon Property is known to have been building the stake in Liberty over the past few months, and analysts said the public declaration of its stake at the 3 per cent disclosure level was unlikely to be the act of a predator.Westfield, the Australian shopping centre owner, and Singaporean sovereign wealth investor GIC have previously been linked with Liberty. Both Liberty and Simon declined to comment.Simon Property owns or has an involvement in 383 properties across the world, including malls in Italy, France and Poland, but it is not known for taking indirect stakes in rival shopping centre owners. This is the first time that Simon has become involved in the UK property market, either directly or through a public stake in another company.Shares in Liberty closed the day up 68½p at 943½p. Liberty International is one of the most short-sold stocks on the market, however, and some of the price movement probably reflected the closing of positions.Shares in Liberty fell sharply this month, when it revealed an unexpectedly high level of bad debt caused by its retail tenants going into administration. The move sparked similar takeover speculation about UK peers such as Hammerson, which also closed the day up 47p at 920p.
67;SPG;Simon Property Group;2007-03-06T22:01:22Z;Wall St rallies on weaker yen;;"Wall Street stocks on Tuesday made their biggest one-day gains since July as a rebound in overseas equities and a weaker yen lifted spirits.After a torrid week for equities, almost all sectors advanced, led by some of the financial, materials and technology stocks that have particularly suffered of late.The tentative recovery came in spite of moderately disappointing economic data that showed a higher-than-expected rise in labour costs and lower-than-expected pending home sales and factory orders.“The market was deeply oversold in a bloody week that quickly changed from greed to fear. We are well overdue for at least a knee-jerk bounce,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite surged 1.9 per cent to close at 2,385.14, lifted by Cisco and Google.The S&P 500 Index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,395.41 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.3 per cent higher at 12,170.34. The rally recovered Monday’s losses in the biggest one-day percentage rise in the S&P and Dow for more than six months.Investment banks and brokerages improved after a bad week as fears about the financial markets began to ease. Bear Stearns was 3.1 per cent higher at $149 while Lehman Brothers leapt 4.4 per cent higher to $74.23.Shares in mortgage lenders also experienced a bounce after Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, said the subprime mortgage problems were contained.Countrywide was 4.7 per cent stronger at $36.85 while subprime lender New Century Financial gained 10.1 per cent to $5.02 after losing almost two-thirds of its market value on Monday.Real estate investment trusts were on the march, with the MSCI Reit Index up 3.5 per cent while shares in the Simon Property Group rose 4.7 per cent to $109.07.Analysts at Bear Stearns raised their rating on Texas Instruments to “outperform”, lifting its shares
1.5 per cent to $31.35. Texas was one of a number of technology groups that showed strength.Google and Apple rose 3.7 and 2.2 per cent respectively to $457.55 and $88.19 on signs that the two companies were working together more closely. Cisco rose 2 per cent to $25.96.Rising commodity prices helped materials stocks recoup some losses, with the aluminium group Alcoa up 2.1 per cent to $32.41 and US Steel rising 3.2 per cent to $87.67.Altria made gains after analysts at Deutsche Bank upgraded the group from “hold” to “buy”, arguing it was undervalued. Its shares rose 2.7 per cent to $84.42.Sentiment was given an additional boost by merger and acquisition activity, such as Citigroup’s $10.75bn bid for Nikko Cordial, Japan’s third-largest brokerage. Citigroup’s stock gained 2.7 per cent at $50.58."
68;SPG;Simon Property Group;2006-11-24T18:52:47Z;US retailers fire starter gun on sales;;US shoppers on Friday launched their frantic traditional post-Thanksgiving Day assault on stores and malls across the country, amid predictions of a solid but not spectacular holiday season for the retail sector.The annual Friday ritual of early-morning openings and “door-buster” limited availability offers is used by retailers to mark the start of the holiday shopping season.However, most leading retailers now launch their Christmas marketing campaigns at the beginning of November.This year the event again crept into the Thursday holiday itself – led in part by online retailers, who last year saw a spike in transactions from customers shopping from home on the holiday.Underlining the trend, Amazon, the largest online retailer, staged a Thanksgiving afternoon promotion in which it sold 1,000 Xbox 360 systems for a third of their advertised price. Kmart’s 1,400 discount stores opened for the first time on Thanksgiving Day, while CompUSA, the computer retailer, opened its stores from 9pm to midnight. FAO Schwartz, the Manhattan toy store, also opened on Thursday.Department stores, including JC Penney, Kohl’s, Saks and Macy’s also launched “pre-Thanksgiving” sales in the week before the holiday.A number of malls owned by Simon Properties opened their doors at midnight on Thursday. But the early Friday morning remains the most bitterly contested retail battleground. The focus on the day after Thanksgiving continues a tradition that dates back to the days when department stores reopened their stores with Christmas decorations and settings on the day after the holidays.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, and Best Buy and Circuit City, the largest electronics retailers opened their doors at 5am on Friday, with customers in some locations queuing all night for “door-buster” bargains, traditionally advertised in Thanksgiving Day papers.In an effort to thwart websites that have managed in the past to publish details of its door-buster offers ahead of time, Wal-Mart this year announced 17 “secret” items on its website on Thanksgiving Day – including the latest Xbox game console that would be limited to just six per store.The hooplah this year also included a stunt by David Blaine, the escapologist, in New York’s Times Square sponsored by Target, Wal-Mart’s main rival.Overall, economists are predicting stronger consumer spending over the holidays than last year, despite an initial level of pessimism based around high fuel prices and interest rate concerns.The National Retail Federation in September predicted a modest 5 per cent increase this year in sales in November and December to $457.4bn against a 6.1 per cent increase last year.But Wayne Best, Visa USA’s chief economist, said earlier this month that it expected growth of 7.5 per cent, as lower fuel prices and a buoyant stock market have improved consumer’s confidence.
69;SPG;Simon Property Group;2004-12-23T13:10:40Z;Macerich joins mall consolidation wave;;The rapidly consolidating US shopping mall industry produced another large merger on Wednesday as The Macerich Company agreed to buy Wilmorite, a private partnership, for $2.3bn including debt.The deal will give Macerich control of some landmark suburban shopping malls in the US north-east, such as the Tysons Corner Center outside Washington DC and the Danbury Fair Mall outside New York. Macerich shares were down 4 per cent in morning trading, as Wall Street gave a lukewarm reception to the deal. ?Our initial reaction is that this is a fully priced transaction,? said equity analysts at Morgan Stanley.The agreement is the latest in a wave of consolidation that is being driven by the industry's saturation. In August, General Growth Properties, the second largest US shopping mall owner, sealed the biggest US property deal when it agreed to buy The Rouse Company, a Maryland-based rival, for $12.6bn.That deal followed Simon Property Group's $3.5bn takeover of Chelsea Property Group, announced in June after the end of Simon's long and ultimately unsuccessful hostile bid for Taubman Centers.In the 1980s and 1990s, a rash of new shopping centres spread across the country in response to the growing strength of the US consumer.But new mall construction slowed in recent years, prompting the largest owners to seek alternative ways to enhance earnings, including acquisitions.?With this transaction, Macerich has clearly made a stand that it intends to be an acquirer, not a seller in the current hot retail consolidation environment,? said David Shulman, a Lehman Brothers analyst, on Thursday.The acquisition marks a further step in the expansion of Macerich, which was founded in 1964 when Mace Siegel and Richard Cohen, two entrepreneurs who combined their first names to form the company's name, bought their first property: an abandoned athletic field in a small Iowa town.Deutsche Bank advised Macerich. Morgan Stanley advised Wilmorite.
70;SPG;Simon Property Group;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
