0;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-16T19:08:48Z;ConocoPhillips slashes oil output and spending plans;Company makes biggest production cuts of any US energy producer as coronavirus impact deepens;"ConocoPhillips has slashed its spending plans and announced the biggest oil output cuts yet by a US energy producer as the sector retreats in the face of historic demand losses and plummeting prices.Conoco said it would “voluntarily curtail” 225,000 barrels a day — almost a fifth of its recent total — across North America. The planned reduction would be greater than that of most countries involved in the Opec+ deal agreed at the weekend, the biggest-ever cuts agreement. The company said operating capital expenditure this year would be $4.3bn, down 35 per cent on its original capex plan. Operating costs would fall 10 per cent compared with its original guidance, to $5.3bn, while total cash savings would amount to $5bn versus previous guidance, it said. “These actions reflect our view that near-term oil prices will remain weak, largely due to demand impacts from Covid-19 and continued oil oversupply,” said Ryan Lance, chief executive.Global oil demand is now down as much as 30 per cent because of global coronavirus lockdowns and analysts fear North America’s onshore storage facilities could soon fill up, forcing companies to shut production.Conoco said it would reduce output at the Surmont oil sands facility in Canada by 100,000 b/d to just 35,000 b/d by May. Canadian oil grades have traded beneath $5 a barrel in recent weeks.

The company said it would also cut another 125,000 b/d across the US starting next month.Its cuts are the biggest announced by a US producer so far. Supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron recently cut capex and reduced planned shale output growth.Chevron on Thursday announced it had sold its interests in some oilfields in Azerbaijan and a pipeline to Turkey to Mol, the Hungarian company, for about $1.6bn.Shale producer Continental Resources recently said it would cut production by about 30 per cent, or 50,000 b/d. Other producers have cut spending without specifying their production cuts.Producers in North America’s high-cost oil sector have been ravaged by a near-70 per cent drop in crude prices since the start of the year. Despite Sunday’s Opec+ deal, which pledged to cut almost 10 per cent from global supply in May and June, US oil prices remained below $20 on Thursday.The US Department of Energy now forecasts the country’s crude oil production, which hit 12.7m b/d in January, will end the year 1.6m b/d lower.On Tuesday the Texas Railroad Commission, the state’s oil and gas regulator, held a hearing into proposals to mandate production curtailments."
1;COP;Conocophillips;2019-04-30T12:38:43Z;Canadian recovery helps ConocoPhillips beat expectations in Q1;Earnings per share up 4 per cent from the equivalent period of 2018;ConocoPhillips, the largest US oil and gas exploration and production company, reported earnings for the first quarter that were above analysts’ expectations, helped by a return to profitability for its Canadian operations.Earnings per share, excluding one-off items, were $1, up 4 per cent from the equivalent period of 2018.Unlike many of its peers in the US E&P industry, the company generated free cash flow that was comfortably able to cover its capital spending and dividend payments. Cash from operations was $2.89bn in the quarter, while capital spending was $1.6bn and dividend payments were $350m. The company also bought back about $800m worth of shares.Profits in Conoco’s business in the “Lower 48” contiguous states of the US were squeezed by oil and gas prices, and after-tax earnings there dropped 37 per cent to $193m.However, that impact was offset by a recovery in the price of heavy crude produced in Canada, and Conoco’s business there swung into a profit of $122m, from a loss of $65m in the equivalent period of 2018.Total production, excluding the operations in Libya, was 1.318m barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing 5 per cent underlying growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals.Production in the “big three” shale oil plays of the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken rose 30 per cent to 326,000 boe/d.Ryan Lance, chief executive, said in a statement that Conoco had set a strategy “designed for the volatile environment that we believe has become the norm”.At its meeting for analysts and investors in November, Conoco plans to set out a plan for its capital investment over the next decade, which it says will enable it to increase production while returning 30 per cent of its cash from operations to shareholders, with US benchmark crude at $50 a barrel. It expects to be able to generate free cash flow even with US crude below $40.Mr Lance said: “We continue to execute and deliver on a plan that’s resilient to lower prices, while offering investors upside to higher prices. We approach the business with an aim to level-load our investment and distribution programs, rather than chase cycles up or down, because we believe that is the best way to create sustained value in the energy sector.”
2;COP;Conocophillips;2019-04-18T11:57:41Z;Chrysaor strikes $2.7bn deal for ConocoPhillips’ North Sea assets;Private equity-backed UK oil company becomes one of the basin’s largest producers;Chrysaor, the private-equity backed UK oil company, has bought the North Sea assets of US energy major ConocoPhillips in a $2.7bn deal that will catapult it into the top ranks of producers in the region.The acquisition of Conoco’s North Sea assets is the biggest in the exploration and production sector outside of the US this year, and will add approximately 72,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day to Chrysaor’s output.Phil Kirk, Chrysaor chief executive, has laid out ambitious plans to become one of the largest producers in the ageing basin since its $3bn deal two years ago to acquire a host of Royal Dutch Shell’s old assets.With ConocoPhillips production Chrysaor will challenge France’s Total as the biggest producer in the UK portion of the North Sea, with both companies set to produce more than 180,000 boepd this year.It marks the latest evolution of the basin which is increasingly attracting private equity cash at a time when many energy majors are looking at other, faster-growing opportunities like US shale.“This significant acquisition reflects our continuing belief that the UK North Sea has material future potential for oil and gas production,” said Mr Kirk.The company, which is chaired by former Shell executive Linda Cook, is part of the Harbour Energy arm of EIG Partners, a $29bn investor in energy projects worldwide.Under the agreement, which was announced shortly after the FT reported the deal, Chrysaor will become operator of two new hubs — Britannia and J Block in the central North Sea.The deal, which comes as ConocoPhillips is pulling back from the North Sea, will also involve an interest in the BP-operated Clair field, in the key west of the Shetland islands area, which is considered the growth area of the mature North Sea basin.ConocoPhillips will retain its trading business in the UK and its stake in the Teesside oil terminal, but is otherwise leaving the North Sea after five decades.“We are extremely proud of the legacy we’ve built in the UK over the last 50 years and are pleased that Chrysaor recognises the value of this business,” said Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive.Ineos, the energy and petrochemicals group controlled by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, had previously been in exclusive talks with ConocoPhillips for its North Sea assets, having paid a substantial deposit, but negotiations between the two broke down in January.Chevron, another US oil major, has also put its assets up for sale in the North Sea as US companies increasingly focus on the shale sector and other prospects.Chrysaor would assume responsibility for an ongoing decommissioning programme on ConocoPhillips assets in the southern North Sea, which they said they hoped to have completed by 2022.Jefferies and BMO Capital Markets acted as joint advisers to Chrysaor on the deal.
3;COP;Conocophillips;2019-03-08T19:26:14Z;Venezuela ordered to pay $8.7bn to Conoco over asset seizure;Award is one of the largest arbitration settlements on record;Venezuela’s financial difficulties have been deepened by an award of $8.7bn to ConocoPhillips of the US, as compensation for the expropriation of its investments in the country in 2007, in one of the largest arbitration settlements on record.The award was made by a tribunal of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, part of the World Bank Group, which ruled in 2013 that the government of former president Hugo Chávez had breached one of Venezuela’s bilateral investment treaties when it took control of Conoco’s stakes in three oil projects in the Orinoco Belt.The timing and procedures for collecting the settlement remain to be determined, and Venezuela is expected to seek to have the ruling overturned. The award appeared to have no impact on Conoco’s share price, which was down about 4 per cent at about $65 in early afternoon trading as crude prices weakened.However, the size of the award will make it a significant issue for Venezuela.Conoco was last year awarded about $2bn from PDVSA, Venezuela’s national oil company, in a separate arbitration process under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. That award was also related to the expropriation of the stakes in the three projects.Although PDVSA initially seemed reluctant to pay, Conoco quickly secured court orders granting it control over the Venezuelan group’s assets in Curacao, Bonaire, St Eustatius and Aruba in the Caribbean, and a deal was reached over a payment plan a few months later.PDVSA agreed to make an initial payment of $500m, part in cash, part in oil, and then to pay about $85m per quarter for about four and a half years.ConocoPhillips’ law firm for the arbitration was Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer
4;COP;Conocophillips;2019-02-13T04:00:27Z;Private equity leads the changing of the North Sea guard;Wave of new investment and M&A grips five decades-old basin as oil majors retreat;When Jonathan Roger, the former head of Centrica’s upstream oil and gas business, struck out on his own and set up an outfit to buy assets in the UK North Sea, conditions in the region were tough.“When we launched the business, not long after the oil price took a tumble at the end of 2014, deal-doing was very, very difficult during that period,” recalled Mr Roger, who set up Siccar Point with the backing of private equity groups Blackstone and Blue Water Energy. “If you look at the M&A environment [at the time], it was the lowest for many years but we persevered through,” he said.Two years later, when Siccar Point bought the North Sea assets of Austria’s OMV in a $1bn deal, it marked not only the largest M&A transaction in the region since the oil price collapse but was a turning point in what would transpire to be a significant changing of the guard in the five decades-old basin. More than $12bn of private equity money poured into the UK North Sea in the following two years, as a new breed of companies backed by some of the biggest names in the industry — including the likes of Carlyle Group and CVC Capital Partners — burst on to the scene, convinced they could still make money out of an ageing oil and gas basin.This changing face of the North Sea is far from over, according to industry executives and analysts. A further $13bn of private equity investment could be deployed to further shake up the industry, according to analysts at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, as oil majors and utilities continue to reshape their portfolios, retreat from oil and gas production altogether or focus their investment in lower-cost regions.This year is shaping up to be another period of significant change with assets on the block from a number of majors, including Chevron and ConocoPhillips.Other less traditional players, in particular the privately owned energy and petrochemicals group Ineos, are also playing a part. While private equity money is not new to the North Sea, and assets have always changed hands in the region, industry executives say this latest wave of M&A activity is different.As the UK North Sea continues to mature and its cost base remains high relative to other regions, its place on the list of investment priorities at some oil and gas majors is slipping away.New buyers, with more appetite or new ways of working to squeeze extra life out of existing fields — or to bring developments on stream — have been required to help extend the basin’s life.Here we look at some of the biggest new players shaking up the industry.Chrysaor has established itself as one of the biggest private-equity backed exploration and production companies in the North Sea, following its acquisition of a host of assets from Royal Dutch Shell in 2017 for more than $3bn.The company’s 400-strong workforce is on course to produce about 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent in 2019 and Phil Kirk, chief executive, admitted it was on the lookout for further, sizeable acquisitions.“Anything over $1bn we’ll look at,” said Mr Kirk, who trained as an accountant before starting his career in the oil and gas industry with Hess in 1996. Chrysaor has been linked to deals for both ConocoPhillips and Chevron’s asset sale programmes in the North Sea.Backed by Harbour Energy, which is run by former top Shell executive Linda Cook, Chrysaor says it is positioning itself as more than just an acquisition-led business.Harbour Energy is in turn backed by EIG Global Energy Partners, which manages investments totalling more than $22bn globally.Chrysaor operates eight fields spread over three hubs in the North Sea, and believes the best route to reach its production target of 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) is to also explore organic growth within its existing portfolio. “We have no pressure to IPO, sell, or return cash within a set timeframe,” Mr Kirk said.“We’re not handcuffed by knowing when we have to list by, which could be at the wrong time in the commodity cycle.”Like others, Mr Kirk said the tax and regulatory changes made to the North Sea helped the latest wave of private equity deals. For example, changes that allow the tax history of a North Sea field to be transferred so a buyer can use them to offset future decommissioning costs. Neptune rose to prominence last year with the purchase of the oil and gas assets of France’s Engie for $3.9bn. That has given the company a footprint spanning not only the North Sea, but north Africa and south-east Asia too, with production of more than 150,000 boepd, though the majority of its output is gas.“We’re much more than just a North Sea player,” Mr Laidlaw said. The company, which was originally seeded with capital by Carlyle and CVC Capital also added China Investment Corporation to its backers through the Engie deal.Neptune, alongside Chrysaor, was once touted as a potential buyer for almost every major deal that came up in the North Sea, but Mr Laidlaw and chief executive Jim House have struck a slightly different tone in recent months. They say the value they have uncovered within the Engie portfolio has encouraged them to develop their existing assets, though they will not rule out further deals.“We’ve seen a lot of potential within the existing portfolio so we don’t have to do anything,” Mr Laidlaw said. “But if we see the right opportunities that will add further long-term growth and good value for shareholders then we will do them.”Neptune has made little secret of its plans to eventually list on the stock exchange, going so far as publishing quarterly results despite having no regulatory requirement to do so. But Mr Laidlaw stresses it is not under any pressure.“We have longer life reserves, we’re not facing decommissioning costs, we have growth, and we are generating strong cash flows that could support a dividend,” he said. “If we wanted to, our portfolio is much more IPO ready than many others out there. But we think there’s a lot more performance improvement to come. We’re not in a rush to do it.”Ineos has a been a fixture in the North Sea for more than a decade, but as a refining powerhouse rather than an explorer and producer.That has changed in the past four years, since it bought the North Sea assets of Germany’s DEA Group in 2015 and those of Danish company Orsted — previously called Dong Energy — in 2017.The $1bn deal for Orsted’s assets gave Ineos about 100,000 boepd, primarily in the Norwegian North Sea, adding to its gasfields off the UK coast, and the company has since shown an appetite for further expansion.It came close to buying up to $3bn of ConocoPhillips’ North Sea assets at the turn of the year, before an exclusivity contract, for which it had paid a handsome premium, expired last month.It has also been linked to a host of other assets, including gasfields owned by Anglo-French company Perenco that produce about 70,000 boepd. Geir Tuft, who runs Ineos’s oil and gas business, said it had not been put off by the collapse of the ConocoPhillips deal.“We’ve grown up in Ineos doing deals,” Mr Tuft said. “There will always be another one down the road.”He emphasised, however, that Ineos did not just want to expand production for its own sake although it is facing production declines at some of its assets.“Generating value is at the heart of what Ineos does,” Mr Tuft said, saying that while the plan was to grow its output in the North Sea, partly to offset declines at existing fields, it was not singularly focused on its overall production number.“When we buy an asset it’s generally to keep it for the long run. We’ve got a patient owner where we can get to a size where we can do that,” he added.Mr Roger believes Siccar Point benefited from first-mover advantage when it completed the deal with OMV in 2017.The difficulties many of the larger oil companies found themselves in following the oil price crash allowed Siccar Point to “get assets that would typically not have been for sale”, he said. The competition then was also “pretty limited”. Siccar Point’s assets, which include an 11.75 per cent stake in the BP-operated Schiehallion field and 70 per cent of the Cambo oilfield, about which it expects to make a final investment decision this year, are largely concentrated in waters to the west of the Shetland Islands, considered the growth region of the North Sea.Siccar Point has funds to do further deals but any opportunities would have to compete with its portfolio of existing development opportunities, said Mr Roger. “The assets have got to be absolutely high quality for us to be interested.”Mr Roger acknowledges private equity investors are often accused of short-termism but added that they brought “good strategic advice” and strong relationships with banks. The private equity-backed oil groups also tended to have much lower cost bases, he said. “We are running this business with less than 40 staff.”Kerogen Capital has a 21.9 per cent stake in Hurricane Energy, the listed explorer active in the region west of Shetland.Kerogen is also the majority shareholder in the private group Zennor Petroleum. Jason Cheng, managing partner and co-founder at Kerogen, said private equity-owned companies were able to move much faster to exploit assets.“The structure of private equity is different. When you look at having a much more streamlined, nimble decision-making structure . . . you can do things more quickly,” he added.Kerogen also has further appetite for deals in the region.“A lot of assets are for sale at the moment and we pretty much look at everything on its merits, both in terms of geography within the North Sea and the play type,” Mr Cheng said.“We could invest in larger asset packages and it would be a new standalone investment for us. For smaller assets, we would probably review it as a bolt-in acquisition through one of our platforms.”Set up in 2016, First Alpha Energy Capital is one of the more recent private equity investors looking at the UK North Sea.Its founders include former JPMorgan Cazenove bankers Verne Grinstead and Fred Lucas and David Latin, an oil industry veteran who worked in various roles at BP and Austria’s OMV.
5;COP;Conocophillips;2019-01-31T17:34:55Z;Higher oil production and prices boost ConocoPhillips in Q4;;Higher oil prices and increased production helped ConocoPhillips report earnings and revenue ahead of market forecasts in the fourth quarter, pushing shares higher in morning trade.Production, excluding Libya, reached 1.31m barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in the fourth quarter, a 7.7 per cent increase from a year ago and 7.3 per cent higher than the September quarter.The realised price for oil, of $53 a barrel, in the fourth quarter, was up 15 per cent from a year ago, but down a touch from the $54.20 during the September quarter, just before Brent crude reached a four-year high in October.Still, that helped push total revenue 18.6 per cent higher from a year ago to $10.36 in the fourth quarter, and ahead of the median estimate of $10bn in a Refinitiv survey of analysts.Adjusted earnings of $1.13 a share were up from 45 cents a year ago and ahead of Wall Street forecasts for $1.01 a share.The Houston-based company said it expected production in the current quarter to be in the range of 1.29m to 1.33m boe/d, which it said would reflect a planned turnround in Qatar of about 15m boe/d and government-mandated production curtailment in Canada of about 10m boe/d. Production is expected to increase in the second half of the year, ConocoPhillips said.In a memo to staff earlier on Thursday, the company also confirmed that negotiations had broken down regarding the sale of its assets in the North Sea to privately owned energy and chemicals group Ineos.Shares were 2.7 per cent higher around midday on Thursday, leaving them 8.2 per cent higher for 2019 to date.
6;COP;Conocophillips;2019-01-31T16:03:03Z;Ineos fails to reach deal with ConocoPhillips on North Sea assets;Energy and chemicals group to lose ‘substantial’ deposit after talks fall through;Ineos, the privately owned energy and chemicals group run by multi-billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, has failed to reach a deal with ConocoPhillips over acquiring the US oil major’s assets in the North Sea, despite several months of exclusive talks.ConocoPhillips confirmed the breakdown of negotiations in a memo to staff on Thursday and said it would now engage with other potential bidders. These are expected to include Chrysaor, the private equity-backed energy company that became a leading North Sea producer after acquiring $3.8bn worth of assets in the region from Royal Dutch Shell in 2017.“The period of exclusive negotiations with Ineos has concluded and we will now continue the marketing process with a number of additional parties expressing interest in our UK assets,” the memo read.Ineos also confirmed the talks had come to an end.Ineos will forfeit a “substantial” deposit paid to keep the talks exclusive. It had paid the retainer — a practice that remains fairly unusual in the energy industry — fearing considerable competition from other potential bidders, including newer private equity-backed players that have build up a strong presence in the region in just a few years.However, after news of the exclusive talks broke in November, oil prices took a turn for the worst, which would have made valuing the assets difficult in such a volatile environment.Brent crude oil fell from $86 a barrel in early October to below $50 a barrel between Christmas and New Year. While it has rallied back to $62 a barrel since then, most analysts are cautious about the potential for significant further gains given the growth in supplies from the US shale sector.Wood Mackenzie, the oil and gas consultancy, estimates that up to $8.8bn worth of assets may exchange hands in the North Sea as oil majors scale back their operations in the region and sell to newer companies, which believe they can squeeze more life out of mature fields or have greater appetite to develop fields not yet in production. US energy major Chevron also last year started a sales process for its North Sea assets.Analysts say some of the listed independent explorers and producers should not be discounted as potential buyers, however, despite many of them carrying hefty debt burdens. They point to recent examples of sellers agreeing unconventional funding packages with independent producers. In 2017, for example, EnQuest agreed to buy a 25 per cent stake in the Magnus field from BP but no upfront payments were involved. Instead, it was agreed the purchase price would be met by cash generated from the field.Premier Oil, the heavily indebted UK independent oil and gas company, has been linked to the Chevron assets. However, its share price suffered after a report in a UK newspaper suggested it could fund a potential acquisition via a rights issue, forcing the company to issue a statement to the stock exchange assuring that “no firm decision” had yet been made to bid for all, or any of, the Chevron assets.News of the talks ending between Ineos and ConocoPhillips was first reported by Bloomberg.
7;COP;Conocophillips;2018-11-23T18:32:02Z;Corporate week in review, November 24;1MDB scandal, Boston Scientific, StanChart, chipmakers, Tencent and Alibaba;A round-up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.The fallout over Goldman Sachs’ involvement in the vast 1MDB fraud deepened this week, after the bank said its former chief executive met with the man at the heart of the scandal on a second occasion.Lloyd Blankfein, now chairman of Goldman, met with Jho Low in December 2012 at the bank’s New York headquarters during a meeting with the chief executive of Aabar, an Abu Dhabi investment fund, according to a spokesperson for the bank. The revelation that the bank’s most powerful executive met with Mr Low on at least two occasions could hamper the bank’s efforts to distance itself from the Malaysian financier, who has been charged by US prosecutors of masterminding the $2.7bn money laundering and bribery scandal. Earlier in the week, an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund sued Goldman over the scandal, accusing the US bank of bribing its officials during a “massive global conspiracy”.The International Petroleum Investment Company, a former partner of the 1MDB fund, filed a lawsuit in New York seeking unspecified punitive damages from Goldman and individuals, including Tim Leissner, a former partner at the bank who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges over the affair.The long-running 1MDB scandal, in which high-ranking Malaysian officials including former prime minister Najib Razak have been accused of helping loot $4.5bn from the government fund, has spread beyond the country’s borders, ensnaring officials and executives around the globe. Mr Najib, who was charged this year, has denied all accusations.Goldman’s role has come under increasing scrutiny since US prosecutors charged two former Goldman managing directors — Mr Leissner and Roger Ng — for their alleged involvement in the scheme and claimed one current Goldman partner was a co-conspirator.BTG agreed to be acquired by US medical devices company Boston Scientific for £3.3bn in cash amid a flurry of takeovers in the UK healthcare sector.The deal will see Boston Scientific pick up the jumble of healthcare products owned by BTG, which has spent the past few years reducing its reliance on an expensive rattlesnake bite antidote that faces increased competition.It also comes after executive pay criticism against Dame Louise Makin, BTG’s chief executive, over future stock awards and bonus arrangements put in place for the company’s former finance director. Last month, BTG chairman Garry Watts announced his intention to retire by the end of the year.Michael Mahoney, chairman and chief executive of Boston Scientific, said the deal would help enhance his company’s presence in categories including oncology and heart disease. The US group said it expected to realise annual synergies of $175m by the end of 2021, predominantly by eliminating costs.Dame Louise, who took over BTG in 2004, said the cultural and strategic fit with Boston Scientific gave her confidence in the merger. Under her leadership, the company transformed itself from a ragbag of intellectual property rights into a healthcare group that operates in interventional medicine, pharmaceuticals and licensing.Analysts at Panmure Gordon said BTG was the eighth company in the British healthcare sector to be acquired in the past 18 months. It attributed the activity to depressed valuations in the UK compared to global competitors.Boston Scientific is to pay 840p for each BTG share, a premium of 36.6 per cent to its closing price of 615p on Monday. The offer also represents a 51 per cent premium to BTG’s volume-weighed average share price over the past 90 trading days, as volatility from the company’s shaky performance has affected its shares.BTG was created in 1981 by the merger of the National Research & Development Council and the National Enterprise Board. The NR&DC was created in 1948 to help commercialise government patents, which included hovercraft and defence technology, drug treatments and medical devices.BTG said it considered the offer — which values BTG at roughly £3.3bn but may be reduced if it pays any dividend or other distribution before the deal is completed — to be “fair and reasonable”. The company’s directors plan to unanimously recommend to shareholders they vote in favour of the takeover.Alibaba and Tencent’s main business may be shopping and gaming, but their latest earnings reports show they are also giving investment managers a run for their money.The Chinese tech duo’s substantial investment portfolios generated roughly one-third of their pre-tax income in the quarter to the end of September. Tencent declared net other gains of Rmb8.8bn ($1.27bn) while Alibaba noted Rmb6.6bn ($951m) of net interest and investment income.By comparison, Tencent made 7 per cent of its profits from investments in 2016 and 22 per cent in 2017. For Alibaba the share was 14 per cent in 2017 and 30 per cent in the year to March, though some investments may have been booked under different categories in the accounts.The investment gains in the latest quarter were an important buffer for Tencent in particular, as it weathered falling revenues in its gaming division.Standard Chartered is drawing up plans to buy back shares for the first time in a generation as management tries to revive the emerging markets bank’s flagging share price.The buyback plan, which could be announced alongside full-year results at the end of February, represents a significant shift in the direction of the bank, which has raised billions of pounds from investors in the past decade to fund its growth. The proposal is still in its infancy and is contingent on the size of any fine the bank must pay to settle allegations by US authorities that it breached sanctions against Iran, said several people familiar with the plans. Given the sensitivity of the negotiations over the penalty, management are reluctant to put a figure on the scale of any potential buyback, said a person briefed on the plans. However, analysts and investors believe that Standard Chartered would easily be able to afford a buyback of at least £1bn, which could help drive up the company’s share price and its return on equity, a key measure of profitability. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, estimated in a note published this month that the bank was operating with about £3.1bn of surplus capital. One person briefed on the proposal said that any buyback would represent a “disciplined approach to capital allocation” that would balance shareholder returns with the need to preserve capital for the pursuit of new business. The person said a buyback would show that management is serious on boosting the company’s stock price and improving shareholder returns. Bill Winters, chief executive of Standard Chartered, has pledged to achieve a return on equity of 10 per cent in the medium term, well above the 6.1 per cent the bank returned in the first nine months of the year.Chinese investigators said they found “massive evidence” of anti-competitive behaviour by the world’s top three makers of computer memory chips, in a probe that could exacerbate global trade tensions.Officials in Beijing said a price-fixing investigation into South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix and US-based Micron Technology had made “important progress”, without offering any specific examples of wrongdoing.“The anti-monopoly investigation into these three companies has made important progress . . . [It] has yielded massive evidence,” said Wu Zhenguo, head of China’s anti-monopoly bureau under the State Administration for Market Regulation.Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment, while Micron did not respond to a request for comment.The three companies control as much as 95 per cent of the global market for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips, which are widely used in computers and smartphones.After steadily falling for most of the past three decades, the price-per-bit of DRAM chips rose 47 per cent in 2017, according to the US research firm IC Insights, and has continued to increase this year.The Chinese investigation follows a class-action lawsuit in the US, lodged in April, which alleges that the three companies conspired to inflate DRAM prices. The companies are contesting the case.Ineos, the privately owned energy and chemicals group run by Britain’s richest man, is in exclusive talks with US oil major ConocoPhillips to acquire its assets in the North Sea.The potential deal, which has a price tag of more than $3bn according to industry sources, could transform Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s company into a major operator in North Sea oil and gas production, building on other acquisitions and its ownership of infrastructure, refineries and chemical plants fed by the basin.People familiar with the sale process said Ineos had paid ConocoPhillips a “substantial” deposit to give it exclusivity over the talks for three months, fearing competition from other buyers including private equity companies that have a growing role in the North Sea.The ConocoPhillips assets are one of a handful on the block that give companies an opportunity to acquire a substantial North Sea footprint at a time when the energy majors, particularly from the US, have been scaling back in the mature basin to focus on the US shale sector and other prospects.If a deal is reached it would be the latest audacious move by Sir Jim who has built his business empire by borrowing to fund acquisitions in the last decade. Ineos is Britain’s biggest privately owned company with sales of $60bn and earnings before interest, tax and other charges of $7bn last year.Sir Jim founded the company in 1998 and owns a majority stake in the business. The company has expanded from its petrochemicals roots into an industrial conglomerate with positions in other industries including shale exploration, automotive and fashion. Last week Ineos added the resins business of US-based Ashland Global Holdings in a $1.1bn deal.Five of the world’s biggest food companies have abandoned trials aimed at developing a new nutrition labelling scheme for Europe, dealing a blow to efforts to help consumers better understand what is in their food.Coca-Cola, Mondelez, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever have been working together for two years on an “Evolved Nutrition Label”, which would have replaced the monochrome labelling system in place in Europe.The new label sought to use colours from red to green to indicate whether a portion of a given food was high in calories, fat, sugar or salt.But after trials in several countries and consultation with academics and consumer groups, the companies could not gain consensus around the new portion-based, colour-based scheme, said Bart Vandewaetere, a Nestlé government affairs executive.“Colour coding of food labels is very controversial in continental Europe,” said Mr Vandewaetere. “We need leadership from the European Commission to come up with a common approach.”Although the companies have stopped the effort on food labelling, Coca-Cola said that it would continue to trial colour-coded labelling schemes on its beverages.The setback means that European countries will continue developing their own food labelling. In recent years, the UK, Ireland and France have created their own voluntary labelling schemes that use traffic light-like designs to convey information to people scanning packages in supermarkets.
8;COP;Conocophillips;2018-11-18T15:25:30Z;Ineos in exclusive talks with ConocoPhillips for North Sea assets;Britain’s richest man negotiates to buy UK oil holdings worth more than $3bn;Ineos, the privately owned energy and chemicals group run by Britain’s richest man, is in exclusive talks with US oil major ConocoPhillips to acquire its assets in the North Sea.The potential deal, which has a price tag of more than $3bn according to industry sources, could transform Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s company into a major operator in North Sea oil and gas production, building on other acquisitions and its ownership of infrastructure, refineries and chemical plants fed by the basin.People familiar with the sale process said Ineos had paid ConocoPhillips a “substantial” deposit to give it exclusivity over the talks for three months, fearing competition from other buyers including private equity companies that have a growing role in the North Sea.The ConocoPhillips assets are one of a handful on the block that give companies an opportunity to acquire a substantial North Sea footprint at a time when the energy majors, particularly from the US, have been scaling back in the mature basin to focus on the US shale sector and other prospects.A spokeswoman for ConocoPhillips said it was in “exclusive negotiations with Ineos” for its UK assets, excluding the Teesside oil terminal and London.If a deal is reached it would be the latest audacious move by Sir Jim who has built his business empire by borrowing to fund acquisitions in the last decade. Ineos is Britain’s biggest privately owned company with sales of $60bn and earnings before interest, tax and other charges of $7bn last year.Sir Jim founded the company in 1998 and owns a majority stake in the business. The company has expanded from its petrochemicals roots into an industrial conglomerate with positions in other industries including shale exploration, automotive and fashion. Last week Ineos added the resins business of US-based Ashland Global Holdings in a $1.1bn deal.Ineos also owns the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical sites in Scotland’s central belt, and the associated Forties Pipeline System that delivers much of the North Sea oil and gas to shore.The ConocoPhillips assets include a 7.5 per cent interest in the Clair field, which the US company had already disposed of a 16.5 per cent stake in July through an asset swap with BP.Neptune Energy, a private equity backed energy company run by former Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw, is said to have also been in the running for the ConocoPhillips assets. Chrysaor, another private equity backed group that bought a host of North Sea assets from Royal Dutch Shell last year, was also in the running, people familiar with the talks said. Both companies declined to comment.Ineos confirmed on Sunday it was in talks with ConocoPhillips, which were first reported by the Sunday Times, but did not comment on the exclusivity arrangement.Additional reporting by Sylvia Pfeifer and Javier Espinoza
9;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
10;COP;Conocophillips;2018-10-26T15:52:49Z;Big oil persists with spending discipline mantra;European and US rivals keep purse strings tight despite increased quarterly profits;The soaring oil price might have boosted the profits of some of the world’s biggest energy companies when they reported third-quarter results this week, but they are all sticking to one overarching mantra: we’re not going to spend it all.From France’s Total to Norway’s Equinor, and even US exploration and production companies like ConocoPhillips, all of their chief executives hammered home the point that they could not let spending get out of control, even with oil prices 40 per cent higher than a year ago.“What we see across our portfolio is costs are still coming down, mainly through project execution where we have been very disciplined and learned a lot,” said Eldar Saetre, Equinor chief executive, after his group’s results on Thursday.“The industry is starting to heat up a bit so we’re very proud we’ve still been able to do that.”The stance reflects concerns in the industry that investors will no longer stand for freewheeling spending, which during the days of $100 a barrel crude at the beginning of this decade contributed to money being sunk into ever more expensive and complex projects.Their biggest fear is that oil demand growth is no longer a given in perpetuity, with some predicting that by the end of the next decade the industry could be facing a peak in consumption, as government policies try to curb the use of fossil fuels.Investors have been pushing executives to cut costs, reign in investments in the type of oil megaprojects that might take decades to pay back, and focus on generating cash, either for dividends or share buybacks.Bernstein Research said this week that companies were responding, noting that those who had raised capital expenditure in the second quarter had been taught a lesson.“Investors punished E&Ps that raised guidance by 230 basis points on average,” said Bob Brackett at Bernstein.Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said the company was delivering “by successfully executing our disciplined, returns-focused plan”, even as cash from operations more than trebled to $3.5bn.The US company is the biggest operator among the majors in US shale, and has been squeezing costs as it tries to prove the sector can be a cash cow, despite criticism unconventional resources are heavily reliant on financing just to keep operating.Almost one in every four barrels of oil equivalent Conoco produces now comes from shale, with its US operations outside Alaska making $550m in adjusted earnings in the quarter, or almost a third of the total.However, the strategy of cost discipline does face challenges. The recovery in the oil price is slowly starting to lead to a pick-up in activity and with that the cost of hiring oil services companies tends to rise. Oil executives may be wary of mega-projects but they still need to explore and develop resources due to decline rates at existing fields.There has been a rush of mergers in the oil services sector in the past two months, led by Transocean cutting a $2.7bn deal for Ocean Rig in September, as the industry looks to consolidate in the hope of higher prices ahead.Any cuts to capital expenditure budgets have therefore been modest. French energy major Total said it was adjusting it its capex guidance to $16bn but only from a range of $16bn to $17bn previously. Equinor, which was previously known as Statoil, cut its guidance for capex from $11bn to $10bn.Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Italian energy major Eni, which has had one of the most successful exploration campaigns in recent years, said that while it remained focused on expanding they needed to make sure the “underlying cost structure is staying where it was when oil prices were lower”.Investors will be watching closely next week when Royal Dutch Shell and BP, the two largest European majors report, to see whether they too can remain disciplined.Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, said earlier this month that the company was planning on a world of $60-$65 a barrel crude, up from the $50-$55 a barrel level he had said was their assumption previously. Many took that as a sign that keeping spending in check forever, especially when prices are rising, can be a hard promise to keep.
11;COP;Conocophillips;2018-10-25T11:31:45Z;ConocoPhillips profits boosted by higher oil prices;Surging production from shale oilfields proves lucrative;ConocoPhillips, the largest US oil and gas exploration and production company, has reported earnings well above analysts’ expectations and a strong cash flow, boosted by higher crude prices and surging production from its shale oilfields in the US.Earnings per share excluding one-off items were $1.36, more than eight times earnings of 16 cents for the equivalent period of 2017.Ryan Lance, chief executive, said the company was delivering a year of strong performance “by successfully executing our disciplined, returns-focused plan”.Cash from operations was $3.5bn in the quarter, more than three times its level of $1.1bn in the equivalent period of last year, and $600m more than the company’s spending on new wells and other capital, dividend payments and share buybacks.Total production, excluding operations in Libya which have been hit by the crisis in that country, was up 2 per cent at about 1.22m barrels of oil equivalent a day. But within that production from the “big three” shale oil regions — the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford shale in Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota — rose by 48 per cent to 313,000 boe/d.The average realised price for the company’s sales was $57.71 per barrel of oil equivalent, up 46 per cent from $39.49 per barrel equivalent in the third quarter of 2017, thanks to the rise in crude prices over the past 12 months and a shift in the mix of production towards oil, which is more lucrative than gas.Mr Lance said:Our strategy is designed to generate superior returns through cycles by maintaining discipline, focusing on free cash flow and allocating this cash according to clear, shareholder-friendly priorities. This is what the market can expect from us again in 2019.
12;COP;Conocophillips;2018-08-20T13:06:57Z;Venezuela’s state oil group agrees $2bn Conoco payout;Deal ends dispute over nationalisation that had disrupted PDVSA’s exports;Venezuela’s national oil company has agreed to pay $2bn compensation to ConocoPhillips of the US, ending a dispute that had disrupted the state-controlled group’s exports.Conoco said on Monday that PDVSA had agreed to pay the full amount of $2bn awarded by an International Chamber of Commerce tribunal in April, to compensate the US group for former president Hugo Chávez’s nationalisation of stakes in two Venezuelan heavy oil projects in 2007.The pressure on PDVSA to pay up increased in May, when Conoco secured court orders granting it control over the Venezuelan group’s assets in Curacao, Bonaire, St Eustatius and Aruba. The orders caused difficulties for PDVSA, which had used ports, refineries and storage tanks in those islands as routes for Venezuela’s oil exports. It had been forced to transfer oil between tankers at sea or in Cuba, to avoid having it seized under the grant of the ICC award.As part of the settlement, Conoco has agreed to suspend all its legal actions to enforce the award including the orders in the Caribbean islands. PDVSA has in return promised to pay $500m within 90 days, and the remaining $1.5bn, plus interest, in quarterly instalments over the next four-and-a-half years.Conoco said it had “ensured that the settlement meets all appropriate US regulatory requirements, including any applicable sanctions imposed by the US against Venezuela”.Shares in Conoco rose 1.5 per cent in morning trading on Monday to $70.83.The total $2bn payout to Conoco is almost a quarter of Venezuela's $9bn in foreign reserves. The country is overdue on almost $6bn of debt payments on its international bonds, cutting the country off from fresh credit and prompting creditors to try to seize Venezuelan energy assets in an attempt to force payment.Earlier this month, Canadian company Crystallex won a key battle in its attempts to secure $1.4bn in compensation for expropriation of a Venezuelan gold mining project. A judge in a federal court in Delaware accepted Crystallex’s argument that it had the right to seize PDVSA assets in the US.Conoco separately has another action under way against Venezuela at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The tribunal has already ruled that Venezuela acted illegally in seizing Conoco’s assets, and is working on setting the amount of compensation owed.PDVSA had no formal comment about the settlement, and government officials were more interested in reinforcing what President Nicolás Maduro has called “big economic plan” for the hyperinflation-wracked country.In a tweet, Mr Maduro said: “This Monday, Venezuela begins a huge process of economic recuperation, we are living historic days, of a necessary and definitive change.”The economic changes are aimed at ending 1m per cent inflation and include liberalising domestic petrol prices, raising the minimum wage by 3,000 per cent and releasing a new currency, called the “sovereign bolívar”, which will be pegged to Venezuela’s petro cryptocurrency, which is thought to be the first time any country has used such a scheme.Venezuelans who have “fatherland cards”, a rationing system, will still be able to buy petrol at highly subsidised prices that make it among the cheapest in the world. Manuel Quevedo, head of PDVSA, said on Twitter: ”The Venezuelan people will get the gasoline they need via a direct subsidy so as to defend our resources and avoid contraband. PdVSA has enough inventory to meet demand, so avoid unnecessary queues based on unfounded rumors!”
13;COP;Conocophillips;2018-07-26T11:57:44Z;ConocoPhillips profits gush higher on oil price rebound;;ConocoPhillips, the US energy exploration and production company, swung back to big profits in the second quarter, helped by rising oil prices and growing output in its US shale operations.The company had adjusted earnings of $1.3bn, or $1.09 a share compared with $200m or $0.14 a share in the same period last year, with international benchmark crude prices averaging above $70 a barrel in the quarter and the company pumping more oil. Earnings per share were slightly ahead of expectations, with analysts having forecast $1.08 a share for the quarter.ConocoPhillips said that while it planned to remain disciplined on spending it was raising its guidance for capital expenditure to $6bn for the full year from $5.5bn previously, as a result of higher-than-expected oil prices.Alongside the stronger oil price, production in the second quarter, excluding operations in Libya which have been affected by the conflict in that country, was 1.225m barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 5 per cent excluding the effect of asset sales.The boost to production came principally from the 37 per cent growth in the “big three” US shale oil regions: the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the Eagle Ford, also in Texas, and the Bakken in North Dakota. Together the three regions are now producing more than 300,000 boed or just under a quarter of the company’s output, highlighting how the onshore shale patch has become a key driver of ConocoPhillip’s future.Chief executive officer and chairman Ryan Lance said the company had now met all its strategic milestone set out two years ago during the depths of the oil slump, when crude prices had halved from the $100 a barrel seen at the start of this decade.“We’re benefiting from higher oil prices, but also driving underlying cash flow expansion,” said Mr Lance. “We achieved our debt target 18 months ahead of plan, we’ve outperformed on our target payout to shareholders, we’re executing our operating plan and remain committed to our disciplined approach to the business.”The company paid down $2.1bn of debt in the quarter to cut its debtpile down to its $15bn target 18 months ahead of plan, while being able to fund its $300m dividend, capital expenditures and $600m in share repurchases with the $3.16bn it generated in cash from operations, excluding working capital.
14;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Energy majors BP and ConocoPhillips agree asset-swap deal;;BP has entered into an agreement with ConocoPhillips for an asset swap deal, in which the UK energy major will increase its share of the Clair field in the North Sea while its US counterpart will gain a stake in the Kuparuk field in Alaska.BP said on Tuesday it would buy a 16.5 per cent interest in Clair, which it operates in the west of Shetland in the UK, through the acquisition of a Conoco subsidiary. This would take BP’s stake to 45.1 per cent, with Conoco retaining a 7.5 per cent share.In exchange, Conoco is taking on some of BP’s assets in Alaska, including a 39.2 per cent interest in the Greater Kuparuk Area, which the US company operates on the North Slope of Alaska, as well as BP’s holding in the Kuparuk Transportation Company.Details of the transactions, which are subject to regulatory approval, are not being disclosed but are expected to be “cash neutral” for both energy companies.“This is a further step in focusing our portfolio around core assets and developments which have the potential for significant growth,” said Bernard Looney, who heads BP’s upstream division, which overseas exploration and production.Even as some of the world’s energy majors have been selling their assets in the ageing North Sea basin, production has seen a revival in recent years as companies invest more money and use advanced technologies to retrieve more oil.The giant Clair field once had more than 7bn barrels of hydrocarbons and produced an average of 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2017. A second development phase is expected to start production later this year with production capacity of 120,000 boed.Mr Looney said BP would sell its holding in the Greater Kuparuk Area, which had average production of around 108,000 b/d in 2017 through the namesake oilfield and several satellite ones, in order to focus on managing its share of the massive Prudhoe Bay oilfield.In a separate statement Ryan Lance, chief executive officer of Conoco, said the company was looking to continue expanding oil production in Alaska: “We have a long history of creating value in Alaska and an ongoing commitment to invest in our legacy assets, as well as in the development of our recent exploration success”.Conoco last winter held its biggest exploration programme in Alaska since 2002, and last month it completed the $400m acquisition of a stake in assets in the North Slope field from Anadarko Petroleum. It has had considerable success with its exploration, including the discovery of the 300m barrel Willow field in 2017, and is making progress with several new production projects.
15;COP;Conocophillips;2018-07-02T10:00:25Z;Conoco’s step back from Permian Basin is temporary, CEO says;Lance predicts short-term pipeline bottlenecks will not curb US oil production growth;US oil production can “comfortably” continue its strong growth over the next few years, in spite of hold-ups caused by a shortage of pipeline capacity in Texas, the chief executive of the country’s largest exploration and production company has said.Ryan Lance of ConocoPhillips attracted attention when he told a conference last month that Conoco was looking at redeploying resources out of the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the new US oil boom.But talking to the Financial Times, Mr Lance made clear that he saw it as only a temporary delay, caused by the fact that Conoco had been taken by surprise by how quickly the pipelines for taking oil out of the region had filled up.The US could continue to add about 800,000-1.3m barrels a day of additional production each year, he said.“Production has come on quicker in the Permian Basin, because the rigs were ramped up a lot faster than we would have thought maybe a year or a year and a half ago,” Mr Lance said.Conoco had expected pipeline constraints to hit Permian production about a year from now, but instead they are biting already, forcing oil in the region to sell at a steep discount to benchmark US crude.On Friday oil at Midland in west Texas, the heart of the Permian region, was selling at a discount of almost $12 a barrel below oil at the Cushing hub in Oklahoma.Conoco does not have firm commitments for pipeline capacity to take its oil from the Permian to refineries or export terminals, and has had to book space on pipelines as available, or use trucks and possibly trains to carry its oil.It is those challenges that have prompted the company to think about slowing down the rate at which it is drilling and completing wells in the Permian.“We have other opportunities to go spend our capital,” Mr Lance said. “And I am not sure it makes sense to drill into that headwind.”The decision is a complicated one, however, because Conoco also wants to keep working in the Permian to learn about how to operate there, so that “when we’re ready to go into full manufacturing mode, we’re there and we’re optimised”, Mr Lance said.If Conoco does redeploy resources, they would not go out of the US, but to other shale oil regions: the Eagle Ford formation of south Texas or the Bakken of North Dakota, where the company has transport facilities booked and can secure better prices for its production.Activity in the Permian could be ramped back up again as new pipelines are built, adding about 1.5m-2m of new takeaway capacity by early 2020, some of which Conoco has booked for its expected production.Despite the run-up of crude prices, the company is not planning to step up its capital spending.It is retaining its policy of approving new investments only if they can make money with oil at $50 a barrel, even though prices are now comfortably above that. Benchmark Brent crude was over $79 a barrel at the end of last week.“To get into the capital allocation game in our company, you need a cost of supply that’s below $50 and probably closer to $40 a barrel,” Mr Lance said.“We’re not trying to chase the cycle up, so as prices go up dramatically you won’t see us adding a bunch of capital,” he said. “And equally on the downside, we’re not intending to have to chase the market down.”
16;COP;Conocophillips;2018-05-15T03:01:36Z;Collapsing Venezuela oil exports seen to be pushing prices higher;Country’s foreign crude sales have fallen 40 per cent from a year ago;With Venezuela’s exports of crude on the brink of collapsing below 1m barrels a day to historic lows, the bull case for energy has additional support as creditors of the cash-strapped national oil company PDVSA threaten to seize overseas assets.The global energy market is bracing for a spike in crude oil prices as Venezuela’s export troubles intensify, just as Iran’s foreign sales are set to drop because of new US sanctions after the Trump administration’s withdrawal from a nuclear deal.A drop in both Venezuelan and Iranian supply could provide the “perfect cocktail” for oil at $100 a barrel next year or sooner, said analysts at London-based broker PVM.Brent crude hit a near four-year high of $79 a barrel on Tuesday, which may raise pressure on Opec and Russia to unwind their 18-month-old production deal to reduce supplies.Venezuela’s foreign oil sales have fallen 40 per cent from a year ago to 1.1m b/d in April, according to data from tanker tracker website Kpler.And the Opec member’s exports are seen to be dropping sharply as troubles mount for PDVSA, with Russ Dallen of investment bank Caracas Capital saying that the company faces “an avalanche” of lawsuits over unpaid bonds.US exploration and production company ConocoPhillips recently won court orders giving it control over refining and storage assets owned by PDVSA in the Caribbean, a hub for exporting Venezuelan crude to Asia.The enforcement of a $2bn arbitration award, related to the nationalisation of Conoco projects in Venezuela in 2007, prompted PDVSA to suspend oil storage and shipping from Caribbean facilities and order the return of tankers to national waters to avoid seizure.“This shows how devastating not paying arbitrations or debts that are owed by PDVSA . . . could be for the Venezuelan oil exports,” said Francisco Monaldi, at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. “This will worsen the already catastrophic situation”.One industry executive said it was unclear whether Conoco had possession of the seized assets, but PDVSA is challenging the court and trying to sidestep orders. “Short term, this will surely have an impact on both Venezuelan exports and oil markets.”At least 150,000 b/d of Venezuelan crude was exported via the facilities targeted by Conoco. But not only are these supplies at risk, the knock-on effect of any seizures and related backlogs at ports in Venezuela could result in bigger falls in foreign sales.Several oil tankers used by PDVSA have been seized by local authorities for non-payment of debts in the past. But now a fresh round of claims by PDVSA’s contractors could further stymie exports.The drop in essential crude revenues comes ahead of a snap presidential election in Venezuela on May 20, where incumbent Nicolás Maduro is seeking a second term in office despite economic and social crises.The country, which has the world’s largest proven crude reserves, faces a devastating recession and sizeable debt payments to bondholders, while also confronting other arbitration cases after a wave of nationalisations under the late leader Hugo Chávez.SNC-Lavalin, a Canadian engineering and construction group, filed a legal suit in New York last week for default on a promissory note that would allow it to seize assets worth $25m. SNC’s claim is small, but others could follow from those holding identical financial instruments worth more than $2bn.Mr Dallen of Caracas Capital said that SNC and the other noteholders could even get ahead of ConocoPhillips in the queue to seize PDVSA assets. “SNC doesn’t have to register its claim in court, it can just go ahead and enforce,” he said.Such claims could multiply quickly if SNC’s lead is followed by holders of about $23bn worth of PDVSA’s eurobonds, said Mark Walker of advisory firm Millstein & Co in New York, who represents a committee of PDVSA and Venezuelan sovereign bondholders.But Mr Walker warned that a wave of legal actions and asset seizures could go against creditors’ interests. “The fact is that PDVSA doesn’t have any money,” he said. “Creditors need to co-operate.”He said that ConocoPhillips would do well to reach an agreement with PDVSA that allowed it to continue exporting and earning revenues.The danger is that PDVSA may no longer be acting in a rational manner. Last month, two executives at US major Chevron, which has continued to operate in Venezuela, were arrested and charged with treason after reportedly refusing to sign over-priced supply contracts.Until last year, says Mr Dallen, PDVSA had sought to keep its creditors engaged in helping to get its oil to market. But this changed in November with the appointment of Major General Manuel Quevedo as oil minister and head of PDVSA, who had no previous experience in the industry.“Quevedo has declared war on everybody,” said Mr Dallen. “That’s just stupid. They’re your partners — you don’t lock people up for doing their job.”The greatest danger to creditors and PDVSA’s exports is that Mr Quevedo could make use of a presidential decree on April 12 that gives him absolute control of the oil industry, including the explicit power to liquidate PDVSA.Meanwhile, Gary Ross, head of oil at S&P Global Platts, warned that western energy majors could further scale back operations in Venezuela.“There’s little evidence the slide in their production is going to slow,” said Mr Ross. Output has fallen by more than 500,000 b/d in the past year, according to Opec.Meanwhile, although the Trump administration has already imposed far-reaching financial sanctions against Venezuela, an additional risk is potential direct penalties on the oil sector.Sanctions on exports though would be a “bold move”, said Mr Ross. The risk of much higher oil prices would be difficult for the US government to tolerate.If prices keep heading higher and more oil is lost from Venezuela, the US may consider tapping the country’s crude held in its strategic petroleum reserves. “There’s a very important election in November,” he added, referring to the US midterms. “I think [President] Trump would use the SPR.”Reporting by Anjli Raval, Jonathan Wheatley and David Sheppard in London, and John-Paul Rathbone and Gideon Long in Bogotá

Of that I have zero doubt,” he said. “What’s more, I don’t think he’ll even need to resort to outright fraud on election day to do it. The electoral process is skewed so much in his favour that he will get the votes he needs.”The bigger question is what Mr Maduro will do after next Sunday’s vote given the magnitude of Venezuela’s economic collapse, mounting international opposition to his rule, social discontent at home and increasing restiveness within the armed forces.“I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a coup within Chavismo . . . He [Maduro] can’t keep running the country like this,” Mr Pantoulas said. referring to the ruling movement formed by the late President Hugo Chávez, Mr Maduro’s patron and predecessor. “Venezuela at the moment is ungovernable.”Internationally, there is the risk of more international sanctions, including a possible ban by Washington on US purchases of about 500,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan crude exports. Private claims against the government are also starting to snowball.This month, US group ConocoPhillips seized assets that state oil company PDVSA holds in the Caribbean to compensate it for $2bn owed in a dispute dating back a decade. PDVSA recalled its oil tankers to national waters to stop further seizures.Creditors of Venezuela’s partially defaulted $70bn of bonds are also starting to take action. Last month, for the first time, a defaulted bondholder opened a lawsuit in New York against PDVSA, and similar actions are likely to follow.The increasingly cornered Venezuelan authorities have also recently arrested executives from the country’s largest bank Banesco and from US oil company Chevron.“Both incidents show a government with increasingly scarce tools to deal with a rapidly deteriorating economic crisis and threats to internal unity,” said Risa Grais-Targow, Latin American director at the Eurasia Group. “The government has few policy options beyond intervention and scapegoating.”Domestically, there are growing risks too. Fissures may be opening up in the military as soldiers leave its ranks, amid reports of a crackdown on nine officers who were arrested last month on suspicion of plotting an uprising.“Sources agree the situation in the barracks is getting worse by the day, and that without changes, it will explode sooner rather than later,” opposition news website Caracas Chronicles recently reported.Tensions within the governing socialist party have also been long rumoured and are likely to be put to the test as the strains on Venezuela’s economy increase. Mr Maduro has already purged senior ranks and put in place loyal military men, such as Manuel Quevedo as head of PDVSA.But despite such future challenges and current problems that include plunging oil production and hyperinflation, Mr Maduro is still expected to win the May 20 election hands down.“These elections are a fraud,” said María Rosario Pérez, a 38-year-old shop worker in Caracas. “We already know what the results will be. The elections are just pure theatre.”Government-issued food ration cards provide an incentive for many to vote for Mr Maduro in a country suffering widespread scarcities. In addition, the opposition’s best-known figures are under house arrest, barred from seeking office, or in exile.The US, Canada, Europe, and Latin America’s biggest countries say they will not recognise the vote and are considering more international sanctions as punishment.Mr Maduro, meanwhile, has allowed two relatively unknown candidates to run: former state governor Henri Falcón and evangelist preacher Jesús Bertucci. Critics say this provides the appearance of a competitive democratic race for foreign consumption, but it has further divided the demoralised opposition and many are expecting high abstention rates.In contrast to the massed opposition protests of last year, it has been a strangely quiet election campaign as a result, with the government assuming victory and its opponents largely resigned to defeat.“Election fever is the last thing there is here,” said Eugenio Martínez, a Caracas-based journalist and election specialist. “Even Maduro hasn’t staged huge public rallies like we saw in the past. Instead they’ve been smaller events in closed off streets.”— Additional reporting by Vanessa Silva in Caracas"
18;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConocoPhillips ups output forecast for 2018;;ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, has revised up its projection of expected output for 2018, following first quarter earnings that were well above expectations.The company benefited from rising oil prices and rising production in the first quarter, moving it back into profit with earnings per share of 96 cents, compared to a loss of 14 cents in the equivalent period of 2017.The earnings per share were significantly above the average of analysts’ forecasts, which was 73 cents. Revenues were slightly lower than expected at $8.96bn, up 15 per cent on the first quarter of 2017.Production in the first quarter, excluding the operations in Libya which have been affected by the conflict in that country, was 1.224m barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 4 per cent excluding the effect of asset sales. The boost to production came principally from 20 per cent growth in the “big three” US shale oil regions: the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the Eagle Ford, also in Texas, and the Bakken in North Dakota.The company has raised its projection of production this year to 1.2m-1.24m boe/d, up 20,000 boe/d, as a result of strong performance for the quarter and a change in expectations about when assets will be sold.Conoco is comfortably covering its capital spending and dividend payments from its cash flows. In the first quarter it made $2.5bn in cash from operations, spent $1.5bn in capital expenditure including drilling and completing new wells, paid $300m in dividends and used $500m for share buybacks.Conoco was one of the first US E&P companies to say it would be focusing on returns to shareholders through shares and buybacks, a policy that has now become common across the industry.Ryan Lance, Conoco’s chief executive, said in a statement: “We continue to differentiate ourselves by executing on our strategic, financial, and operational plans… We remain focused on creating value for our shareholders by maintaining discipline, following our priorities and staying committed to our returns-focused value proposition.”
19;COP;Conocophillips;2018-04-25T18:48:23Z;ConocoPhillips awarded $2.04bn over Venezuela nationalisation;Arbitration ruling against state oil company PDVSA stems from Chávez-era expropriation;ConocoPhillips, the US exploration and production group, has been awarded $2.04bn in compensation from PDVSA, Venezuela’s national oil company, in an arbitration decision by the International Chamber of Commerce.The award relates to the forced nationalisation in 2007 of Conoco’s stakes in two extra-heavy oil projects in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt, under former president Hugo Chávez. Conoco had claimed maximum compensation of $17bn.Janet Langford Carrig, Conoco’s corporate secretary, welcomed the award. She said: “The ruling upholds the contractual protections to which ConocoPhillips is entitled under the applicable agreements and acknowledges PDVSA’s independent contractual liability arising from the government of Venezuela’s unlawful and uncompensated expropriation of ConocoPhillips’ investments.”The award, which is subject to very limited scope for review, raises the question of how Conoco will be able to collect from a company and a country that are in a deepening financial crisis.One possibility is that Conoco could seek payment from Citgo, PDVSA’s US refining and marketing subsidiary. Conoco has already brought legal action in Delaware to try to strike down PDVSA’s pledge of part of its stake in Citgo as collateral.The award for Conoco is more than double the $908m granted to ExxonMobil in a similar ICC arbitration over expropriation in Venezuela.Separately, Conoco is also pursuing a legal action against the government of Venezuela at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (Icsid).The Icsid tribunal has already ruled that Venezuela broke international law when it nationalised Conoco’s stakes in the two fields. Proceedings are under way to determine the amount of compensation.
20;COP;Conocophillips;2018-03-07T04:39:36Z;Australia-East Timor treaty unlocks $40bn oil and gasfield;Vast reserves to be tapped after resolution of decade-long maritime border dispute;Australia and East Timor have signed a treaty redrawing their maritime boundary, ending a decade-long dispute between the countries and unlocking tens of billions of dollars in oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea.The treaty signing in New York marked the first conciliation under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea — a process officials hope could offer other countries a path towards resolving contentious maritime boundary disputes.“The treaty is a historic agreement that opens a new chapter in our bilateral relationship,” said Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister. “It establishes permanent maritime boundaries between our countries and provides for the joint development and management of the Greater Sunrise gasfields.”The deal is a coup for East Timor, one of the world’s most impoverished countries. Dili has fought a long legal battle to scrap a 2006 maritime deal with Canberra, which it argued did not give it a fair share of revenues linked to the development of the Greater Sunrise oil and gasfield in the Timor Sea.A joint venture between Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Osaka Gas holds commercial rights over the Greater Sunrise project, which is estimated to have oil and gas reserves worth up to $40bn. In an unusual move, the commercial partners were involved in the recent maritime boundary negotiations between the two parties, highlighting the field’s importance to East Timor’s economy.“Greater Sunrise has always been the prize in these negotiations and the bottom line is that under this new agreement East Timor would get more oil and gas money,” said Donald Rothwell, professor of law at Australian National University.Under the terms of the deal, East Timor will get either a 70 or 80 per cent share of revenues flowing from the gasfields, depending on how they are developed by the joint venture partners. This compares with an equal share under the 2006 maritime agreement signed between Dili and Canberra.East Timor later opposed the 2006 treaty and took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. It alleged that under the cover of an international aid programme, Australia bugged its cabinet office in 2004 to obtain commercial advantage in negotiations for the deal, which was struck when the country was still recovering from violence sparked by its 1999 vote for independence.The maritime dispute threatened East Timor’s fragile economy, as revenues from its sole operational gasfield, Bayu-Undan, are set to dry up in the early 2020s. The legal action in The Hague also embarrassed Canberra — one of the biggest overseas aid donors to Dili — which has called on Beijing to follow the rule of law in its activities in the contested waters of the South China Sea.“The agreement is a testament to the way in which international law, in particular Unclos, reinforces stability and allows countries to resolve disputes peacefully. It is an example of the international rules-based order in action,” said Ms Bishop.Agio Pereira, East Timor’s minister, said the treaty was a landmark for his country and the friendship between Australia and East Timor.Prof Rothwell said a potential threat posed to the new agreement would be Indonesia’s reaction. “There could be an issue if Indonesia decides it can also revisit the boundaries it negotiated in the 1970s,” he said.
21;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConocoPhillips raises dividend, ups buyback amid oil rebound;;ConocoPhillips, the largest US oil exploration and production company, has reported earnings above expectations for the fourth quarter of 2017, and increased its dividend and planned share buyback.The results reflect the upturn in oil and gas prices over the past 12 months, as well as rising production from continuing operations, and cost reductions.Earnings per share excluding one-off items were 45 cents, above the average forecast from analysts which was 40 cents.Ryan Lance, chief executive, said the company had had “a very successful year by all measures” in 2017, but pledged to remain careful with capital spending and plans for production growth.He said: “While the outlook for commodity prices has improved, our operating plan remains unchanged and we have already taken clear actions to demonstrate our commitment to maintain discipline and follow our priorities.”The company was still losing money on its “lower 48” US operations outside Alaska in the fourth quarter before tax, but cut its losses there from $327m to $102m for the quarter, and reported strong growth in profits from its other operations.The average price Conoco received from its production was $46.10 a barrel of oil equivalent, up from $32.93 a barrel in the final quarter of 2016.Production outside Libya was 1.22m barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 4 per cent excluding the effect of asset sales.Having been primarily a seller of businesses over the past two years, Conoco announced a small acquisition. It has agreed to pay $400m to Anadarko Petroleum for assets in the north of Alaska where Conoco already has a position.The dividend, which was cut in February 2016 during the worst of the oil slump, is being raised 7.5 per cent to 28.5 cents per share for the quarter, although that is still a long way short of the 74 cents per share that the company was paying in 2015.Conoco also raised its planned share repurchases for this year from $1.5bn to $2bn.
22;COP;Conocophillips;2018-01-10T23:24:21Z;New York sues big oil companies over climate change;City will also look at divesting its pension funds of fossil fuel companies;Some of the world’s largest listed energy companies are facing a lawsuit for “billions of dollars” after New York City accused them of contributing to climate change.The city also said it would start analysing ways to divest its pension funds, which have $189bn in assets, of fossil fuel companies “in a responsible way that is fully consistent with fiduciary obligations”.Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city was seeking damages from BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell to “protect New Yorkers from the effects of climate change”.“We’re bringing the fight against climate change straight to the fossil fuel companies that knew about its effects and intentionally misled the public to protect their profits,” said Mr de Blasio.“As climate change continues to worsen, it’s up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient.”The lawsuit, filed to federal court in New York on Tuesday night, adds to the pressure on the fossil fuel companies, which are already under scrutiny from investors about the impact of climate policies on their future earnings.The same five companies are fighting court cases in California brought by cities and counties over the harm they expect to suffer from climate change.Exxon in a court filing this week described those actions as “abusive law enforcement tactics and litigation” that were attempting to stifle the company’s right to “participate in the national dialogue about climate change and climate policy”.The New York mayor’s office accused the energy companies of being aware of the effects that burning fossil fuels would have on the planet’s atmosphere, citing “recently uncovered documents”.“They deliberately engaged in a campaign of deception and denial about global warming and its impacts, even while profiting from the sale of fossil fuels and protecting their own assets from the effects of rising seas and a changing climate,” the city said.Exxon responded that it welcomed “any well-meaning and good faith attempt to address the risks of climate change”, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions required global action.However, it added: “Lawsuits of this kind — filed by trial attorneys against an industry that provides products we all rely upon to power the economy and enable our domestic life — simply do not do that.”In the past Exxon has attacked allegations that it understood the risks of climate change in private while minimising them in public, describing them as “a complete fabrication that was conceived, paid for, and executed by anti-oil and gas activists”.It argues that critics have “cherry-picked statements from company officials and misrepresented the context of other events and statements, giving an incorrect impression about our corporation’s approach to climate change”Shell, which has said it is setting its strategy for a world of tightening constraints on fossil fuel use, said in a statement: “We believe climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.”[The cases brought by New York and other cities] face an uphill battle, to say the leastChevron described the lawsuit as “factually and legally meritless”, and said it would “only serve special interests” rather than addressing the real issue of climate change. Conoco and BP declined to comment.Previous attempts to use the courts in the US to win damages over climate change have failed. Kivalina, a village in Alaska, sued Exxon, Chevron and others in 2008, but its case was dismissed by the district court, and attempts to persuade the appeals court and the Supreme Court to overturn that decision were unsuccessful.Ben Rubinstein of the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills said the cases brought by New York and other cities “face an uphill battle, to say the least”. Climate change is a complex global phenomenon, and establishing that New York had been harmed by five specific oil companies would be very difficult, he added.In the wake of the Paris agreement to limit global warming and weather events such as superstorm Sandy, governments globally have focused heavily on tackling climate change. President Donald Trump, however, has pulled the US out of the Paris agreement.Pension funds globally have increasingly begun pulling out of fossil fuel companies over concerns about their impact on climate change and fears that their assets could become “stranded” — or worthless — if governments across the world introduce stricter rules to tackle global warming.Mr de Blasio and comptroller Scott Stringer will submit a “joint resolution to pension fund trustees” to begin the process of divesting. New York City’s five pension funds hold $5bn in the securities of over 190 fossil fuel companies.

24;COP;Conocophillips;2017-11-19T18:53:57Z;Conoco sets $50-a-barrel oil price ceiling for new projects;US group targets North American shale for bulk of its investment spending;ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, has ruled out investing in projects that need an oil price of $50 or higher to make a profit, as it attempts to raise shareholder returns after years of poor profitability.It is also committing most of its investment for growth to shale oil resources in North America, arguing that operations there are most able to respond to volatile markets.Companies in the US shale oil and gas industry have generally made poor returns on capital and been unable to cover their costs of drilling and completing new wells from their cash flows.But Conoco is one of many exploration and production companies now trying to deliver improved returns for shareholders and live within its means without requiring continual infusions of fresh capital.Ryan Lance, Conoco's chief executive, said the company was seeking “returns over growth”.“The whole E&P sector, really, has not performed very well, even [through] the commodity price cycles,” he said. “We really want to be a stock that will perform through the cycles.”Mr Lance is planning to increase capital spending to an average of $5.5bn a year in 2018-20, up from $4.5bn this year.But he is trying to maintain cost discipline, with managers seeking support for investment projects in spite of the rise in oil prices since June. US benchmark crude ended last week at about $56.70 a barrel.“You don’t even get through the door unless you are below $50 cost of supply, and you don’t really get to the table in the capital allocation fight unless you are $40 a barrel or below,” he said.He added that those were “fully loaded” costs, including components such as spending on acquiring drilling rights, investment in pipelines and other infrastructure, and corporate overheads, which are often excluded when US oil companies present figures for the economics of their wells.In the oil industry downturn since the summer of 2014, Conoco’s shares slumped along with those of other US exploration and production companies.In the past 12 months, however, they have begun to outperform, rising 14 per cent while the S&P 500 oil and gas production sector has fallen by 5 per cent.Conoco’s free cash position has swung from an outflow of about $470m last year to an inflow of about $450m for the first nine months of 2017, because of higher oil and gas prices, lower costs and asset sales that will cut its debts from $27bn at the end of last year to under $20bn at the end of this year.The increased capital spending for the next three years is intended to drive production growth, which Conoco projects will be 3-6 per cent next year, excluding the lost output from the assets it is selling, and about 5 per cent per year in average.The majority of the capital spending for growth is going to “unconventionals” — shale and similar resources — especially in the Eagle Ford shale and the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. Shale oil is attractive both because its costs are competitive, and because spending can be raised and lowered relatively quickly, Mr Lance said.“You need to have a large part of your capital programme that’s flexible in a given year or two, to deal with volatility in the [oil] price,” Mr Lance said.The dangers of insufficient flexibility were demonstrated in 2016 when Conoco was forced to cut its dividend, which had been affordable with oil at $100 or $80, but not at $60.“It was the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make, because it attacks your credibility as a leader, and where we’re at at the company,” Mr Lance said. “But it was so important for us to do to put ourselves in the position where we’re here today.”He added that while some analysts were sceptical about prospects for continued growth in US shale oil, given the industry’s lack of profitability, he was confident that Conoco could continue to improve productivity and raise production.“The efficiencies there aren’t done yet,” he said. “You probably don’t see as dramatic improvements as we’ve seen over the past three or four or five years, but the learning curve is still there.”
25;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConocoPhillips boosts capital spending for 2018-2020, extends share buybacks;;ConocoPhillips has set its capital spending budget for 2018-2020 at around $5.5bn a year, up 22 per cent from the current year.The US oil and gas major spending cut its capital spending plans for 2017 twice this year as it focuses on financial and shareholder returns. From the initial guidance of $5bn announced in February, it reduced the figure to $4.8bn in July and then to $4.5bn last month.The higher capex spending plans come amid a sharp rally in crude prices over the past month. Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate are trading at over two-year highs this week after climbing 11.5 per cent and 12.4 per cent over the past month.Conoco said in a statement ahead of its analyst and investor meeting that the spending budget was based on WTI staying at around $50 a barrel. The US oil benchmark was trading at $57.03 a barrel on Wednesday.The company also announced plans to extend its $1.5bn a year share buyback for an additional year to 2020. It added that it aimed to cut its debt to $15bn by the end of 2019.Shares in Conoco, up 6.7 per cent so far this year, were unchanged in pre-market trading.(Photo: Reuters)
26;COP;Conocophillips;2017-10-26T17:34:52Z;Statoil and ConocoPhillips to cut capital spending;Explorers aim to ‘get more for less’ as pressure builds to improve returns;The two largest oil companies to report third-quarter earnings so far this year, Statoil of Norway and ConocoPhillips of the US, have reported cuts to their capital spending budgets for 2017, as investors put pressure on the oil industry to improve returns for shareholders.Conoco, the largest US exploration and production company, said it was cutting capital spending while using the proceeds of more than $16bn worth of asset sales to buy back shares and pay down debt.Statoil, which is majority-owned by the government of Norway, said the reduction in capital spending was the result of “hard work” from the company and its suppliers, and “strict capital discipline”.Both companies described their positions as “getting more for less”.Both have benefited from the rise in oil and gas prices over the past year, and reported improved underlying earnings. However, Statoil was hit by an $856m writedown in the value of its holdings in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas, triggered by “lower than expected production”.Statoil’s revenues increased 12 per cent year on the year to $13.6bn, and adjusted earnings — its preferred performance measure — jumped from $636m in the equivalent quarter of 2016 to $2.3bn.After the writedown, however, net losses for the period mounted, rising to $478m in the quarter from $427m in the equivalent period of last year.Its capital spending budget for 2017 was cut from $11bn to $10bn. Eldar Saetre, chief executive, said in a statement that the company was continuing to “realise efficiency improvements and deliver strong progress on project development and execution”.Conoco reported earning per share for the third quarter that were above analysts’ expectations at 16 cents after adjustments to exclude one-off items. That compared with an adjusted loss of 66 cents per share in the equivalent period of 2016.Like the rest of the US exploration and production industry, Conoco reported losses during the oil industry downturn that began when crude prices crashed three years ago, and this is the first time it has reported positive earnings for two successive quarters since 2014. There were sharp improvements in Conoco’s earnings from the US, Canada and Europe and north Africa, helped by a sharp increase in gas prices. It sold gas at an average price of $4.11 per thousand cubic feet, up from $3.05 in the third quarter of 2016. Conoco has cut its capital spending budget for the year by 10 per cent to $4.5bn, and said it was on course to buy back $3bn worth of shares this year. It also plans to cut its debts to less than $20bn by the end off the year, down from $27bn at the end of 2016.The moves are a response to mounting concern from investors over poor returns and long-running cash outflows in the US exploration and production industry. Other companies have also been signalling that they intend to improve shareholder returns. Anadarko Petroleum said last month that it planned to buy back $2.5bn worth of shares by the end of next year.Ryan Lance, chief executive, said management was continuing to “reset our company” through asset sales, debt reduction and share buybacks. He added that even though the outlook for oil and gas prices had improved, “we remain committed to our disciplined strategy”, focused on generating cash and strong financial returns.This year the company has been able to cover its capital spending and its dividend payments from its cash flows, a widely shared objective for exploration and production companies.
27;COP;Conocophillips;2017-10-26T11:45:01Z;ConocoPhillips swings back into profit on higher gas and oil prices;;ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, has reported earnings above analysts’ forecasts and signalled its commitment to improving returns for shareholders by curbing its capital spending and buying back shares.Earning per share for the third quarter, adjusted to exclude one-off items, were 16 cents, compared to an average forecast about about 8 cents. The earnings compared to an adjusted loss of 66 cents per share in the equivalent period of 2016. Concoo has swung back into profit thanks to a steep rise in the selling price of its natural gas, and a more modest improvement in the price of oil.The company has been reporting losses during the oil industry downturn that began when crude prices crashed three years ago, and this is the first time it has reported positive earnings for two successive quarters since 2014.US exploration and production companies have been under pressure from investors this year to show that they can offer better returns to shareholders, and Conoco has been responding to that pressure. It is selling assets worth over $16bn this year, it has cut its planned capital spending budget for 2017 from $5bn to $4.5bn, and it bought back $1bn of shares in the quarter, putting it on track for $3bn of repurchases during the year. It has also cut its debt by $2.4bn, and is on course to have less than $20bn of debt by the end of the year.Ryan Lance, chief executive, said the management was continuing to “to reset our company” through asset sales, debt reduction and share repurchases.He added: “While the outlook for commodity prices has improved, we remain committed to our disciplined strategy. We are focused on free cash flow generation, strong financial returns, shareholder value creation and distributions through the cycles.”So far in 2017, the company has been able to cover its capital spending and its dividend payments from its cash flows, an objective that many companies in the exploration and production companies are seeking.There were sharp improvements in Conoco’s earnings from the US, Canada and Europe and North Africa, helped by a sharp increase in the selling price of the company’s gas. It sold gas at an average price of $4.11 per thousand cubic feet in the quarter, up from $3.05 in the equivalent period of 2016.Production was 1.2m barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 1 per cent from the equivalent period of 2016 after adjusting for asset sales.Conoco shares, up by more than a fifth over the past 12 months, were largely unchanged in pre-market trading.
28;COP;Conocophillips;2017-10-20T17:39:56Z;Nuns tell companies to get real over virtual AGMs;US religious order joins good fight against trend towards online-only annual meetings;The Sisters of St Francis of Philadelphia, known for their work with the poor and elderly, have a new mission: tackling corporate America over online-only shareholder meetings.The 400-strong order of Catholic nuns, whose motto is “No Risk . . . No Gain”, have filed resolutions with ConocoPhillips, the oil group, and Comcast, the telecoms company, over their decisions to scrap physical annual general meetings for shareholders.The nuns, no stranger to the metaphysical realm, are calling for businesses to reintroduce face-to-face meetings with direct access to boards to run next to virtual events. “We fear a reduction in access for shareholders [due to online-only meetings],” they said.A rising number of US companies, including Ford, HP, Duke Energy and PayPal, are moving to virtual meetings, claiming it saves costs and provides greater accessibility for investors. Jimmy Choo, the luxury shoe brand, became the first UK company to host an online meeting in 2016. They remain uncommon in Europe.But opponents argue online-only meetings disadvantage shareholders, particularly smaller investors for whom the annual meeting is often their only opportunity to speak to management.There are also concerns that by moving to virtual AGMs, companies will escape scrutiny over controversial issues. Some shareholders claim boards ignore their questions at online meetings — something that is much harder to do at physical meetings.Timothy Smith, director of environmental, social and governance shareowner engagement at Walden Asset Management, the fund house, said: “If a company faces debate on their [pay] package or its climate-change position or has votes on shareholder resolutions, it is a problem to have a disembodied discussion online for a stockholder meeting.”Broadbridge, the investor services company whose software is used for virtual meetings, said the number of US companies holding virtual-only meetings had jumped almost 50 per cent to 164 during the first half of this year, compared with the same period in 2016.The Conoco resolution has been co-filed by the Church of the Brethren Benefit Trust, which oversees the retirement income of pastors and members of the Brethren community, and the Needmor Fund, a social justice organisation.The nuns wrote in their Conoco filing: “Annual meetings are one of the few opportunities for top management and the board to interact directly, face-to-face, with a cross-section of their shareholders.” They warned that the “controversial” move was setting a precedent to create a “slippery slope” that would also encourage other companies to “insulate themselves from shareholders”.Other investors have echoed concerns.The Council of Institutional Investors, whose members have $3tn in assets under management, has warned companies against hosting virtual-only meetings. Ken Bertsch, executive director at CII, said: “We think shareholders should generally support the continuation of in-person meetings.”New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the $170bn retirement assets of the east-coast city, has also proposed that its pension fund vote against directors on the governance committees of businesses that have cyber meetings only.“It’s one of the great markers of American enterprise — whether you own one share or one million, you can speak at a company’s annual meeting,” Mr Stringer said this year.“[Companies that host cyber-only meetings] want to avoid looking shareowners in the eye — they’re treating face-to-face interaction as a nuisance instead of a duty. If boards shirk this responsibility, shareowners should join us in holding them accountable.”Conoco did not respond to a request for comment. Comcast said virtual meetings allowed all shareholders to participate, regardless of where they lived.“Given the very limited attendance of our prior in-person meetings, we do not believe having an in-person meeting meaningfully increases our interaction with our shareholders,” the company said.Since the start of 2016, the Sisters of St Francis of Philadelphia have also issued AGM resolutions on climate change, drug pricing, corporate lobbying and on the problems at Wells Fargo.In a statement on corporate responsibility on the order’s website, they say they seek “to do the right thing as we continue to confront corporate structures and systems that exploit, alienate, and delude”.
29;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US equities bogged down by energy, insurance;;US equities were showing the lingering effects of Tropical Storm Harvey on Monday, with losses in the insurance and energy sector and the dollar stuck in low gear.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day flat at 21,808, thanks in part to a 2.5 per cent decline for property and casualty insurer Travelers — one of several insurers that took a leg lower as investors contemplated potential post-Harvey claims. On the opposite end of the spectrum, home-improvement retailer Home Depot, however, picked up 1 per cent.The S&P 500 closed nearly flat as well at 2,444, with gains in the healthcare sector — buoyed by biotech stocks, and in particular Gilead Sciences on the heels of its $11.9bn acquisition of Kite Pharma — offset by losses in energy, as shares of oil companies Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips declined.The Nasdaq managed to buck the trend, however, finishing the day with an 0.28 per cent gain at 6,283.The dollar index — measuring the buck against a basket of its peers — was down 0.51 per cent at 92.26, on track for its lowest close since January 2015.Gold, on the other hand, closed above $1,300 a troy ounce for the first time since the week before the US presidential election in November. Both moves have been driven by a lack of clear monetary policy signals out of Janet Yellen’s Jackson Hole speech last week, as well as growing anxieties about the slate of political issues looming over the next few weeks, including Nafta talks and a debate over the debt ceiling.Oil, meanwhile, continued to swing on the latest concerns about Harvey’s effect on the US Gulf coast, a major US refinery hub. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate, the US standard, was down 2.5 per cent at $46.67, while Brent, the international benchmark, declined 0.8 per cent to $51.97. Gasoline futures, meanwhile, picked up 3.6 per cent to $1.72 a gallon.
30;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Tech, energy sectors lead US equities lower as oil prices drop;;A shadow has fallen over the tech and energy sectors in Monday morning trading.Just a few hours before a rare total solar eclipse is set to wind its way across North America, a sell-off in some of tech’s biggest names has sent the sector to the bottom of the S&P 500 with an 0.6 per cent decline.Some of the biggest consumer tech brands were slumping, with Apple down 1 per cent, Microsoft off 0.88 per cent, Google parent Alphabet declining 0.6 per cent and Facebook dipping 0.3 per cent. Chipmaker Nvidia was also under pressure, falling 1.8 per cent.The declining tech sector comes after a week of political turmoil that saw the departure of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and a widening rift between US President Donald Trump and business leaders. As Evercore IS analyst Dennis DeBusschere said in a note on Sunday:Bottom line, to the extent that political risk remains elevated, the market leaders (Tech stocks) that have supported the outperformance of active managers in 2017, will likely come under pressure, but any decline stocks should reverse if political risk fades.The fall also hit the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which was down 0.3 per cent since the start of trading Monday. The S&P 500 by contrast was trading flat at 2,425 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was similarly little changed at 21,665.Energy stocks were also in retreat, with oil giants including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips all in the red as oil prices took a beating.A barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude — the US benchmark — was down 1.44 per cent at $47.80, while Brent, the international standard, had fallen 1.78 per cent to $51.78.
31;COP;Conocophillips;2017-07-27T11:53:29Z;ConocoPhillips quarterly beat underscores energy industry recovery;;ConocoPhillips joined the procession of international oil and gas groups to announce forecast-beating second quarter results on Thursday, adding to signs of recovery in the sector.The US exploration and production company reported a headline loss of $1.1bn in the three months to June because of one-off items, including impairment charges on an Australian LNG project due to reduced forecasts for future prices.But on an underlying basis, ConocoPhillips returned to the black with a profit of $200m, or 14 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1bn in the same period last year. This exceeded the average 1 cent per share loss forecast by analysts.European majors Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Statoil and Repsol also beat market expectations with their second quarter numbers on Thursday, showing how the oil and gas industry is gradually adapting to an era of protractedly low crude prices.ConocoPhillips said operating cash flow exceeded capital expenditure and dividends for a fourth consecutive quarter. But in a sign of the continued pressure on budgets, the company cut its full-year guidance for capital expenditure to $4.8bn from a previous target for $5bn.Operating expenses were down by 8 per cent from a year ago and $3bn of debt was retired in the quarter with a further $2.4bn to be cut in the third quarter, in pursuit of a target to lower borrowings below $20bn by the end of the year.Headline earnings were hit by impairment charges related to asset disposals, premiums on early debt repayments and a write down of expected future revenues from the APLNG project in Australia.Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive, said:We are on track to far surpass our initial debt reduction and shareholder payout targets, while accelerating strong underlying financial and operational performance. We remain focused on lowering our breakeven price for the business, generating free cash flow and delivering strong per-share growth with improving returns through the price cycles. This is the right approach for value creation in the upstream sector, especially at a time of uncertainty in the commodity markets.
32;COP;Conocophillips;2017-04-02T16:21:06Z;Canadian operators buy oil sands assets as foreign groups retreat;As industry comes under domestic control, its ability to grow could be impaired;Canada has been nationalising its oil sands industry. Not in the sense that the government is taking greater control of private companies: it tried that with Pierre Trudeau’s National Energy Program of the early 1980s, and is unlikely to repeat the experiment any time soon.But in a wave of deals in recent months, US and European companies have been retreating from the oil sands of Alberta, and Canadian operators have been stepping in to replace them.Since December, Statoil, Royal Dutch Shell, Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips have announced significant disposals of oil sands assets. In all of those sales, a Canadian company was the buyer.The transactions have benefits for both sides: the international groups are freeing up capital for more appealing opportunities elsewhere, while the Canadian companies are buying additional production at attractive valuations.Like other moves towards economic isolation, however, the Canadianisation of the oil sands also creates vulnerabilities. As the industry increasingly comes under Canadian control, its ability to grow could be impaired.In the 2000s, a project or two in the oil sands was a must-have in the portfolio of any oil company with global ambitions. The industry consensus was that crude supplies would be tight, and even high-cost barrels from the oil sands would be needed to meet growing demand.Today, all the talk is about an “age of abundance”. The US shale revolution has unlocked new sources of supply, and some companies think global demand could peak in the 2020s. Having a position in the oil sands no longer seems so vital.In Canada, as in the rest of the industry worldwide, costs have fallen sharply during the downturn. A new oil sands project will typically need a US crude price of $50-$60 per barrel to break even, according to Kevin Birn of IHS Markit, the research group. That is in line with other higher-cost sources of supply around the world, but the best US shale reserves and even some deepwater offshore projects will be profitable at lower prices.There is also the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, which are significantly higher for the oil sands than for many other sources of crude. Alberta’s new carbon tax, which has been estimated to add up to 75 cents to the cost of a barrel, does not seem likely to make much difference to project economics, but if you believe that governments will over time do more to curb emissions, then that is another reason to be wary of oil sands investment.Perhaps the biggest problem, though, is that a new development in the oil sands can take seven or eight years from first concept to first crude flowing. Activity in shale can be dialled up and down in a matter of months, giving companies the flexibility to respond to changing market conditions.Not every international company is pulling out of Alberta. ExxonMobil has a large presence, in its own right and through Imperial Oil, its 69.6 per cent owned Canadian subsidiary. BP, Chevron, Total and Conoco have stakes in joint ventures. But none of them is highlighting the oil sands as a priority for future investment.No country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them thereFor the Canadian companies that have been the buyers in the recent deals, including Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy and Athabasca Oil, the shift in international companies’ outlook on the oil sands has created opportunities to acquire assets at much lower prices than they would have had to pay three years ago.The great disadvantage of the deals, however, is that assets have generally been sold by larger companies to smaller ones. Shell, with a market capitalisation of $221bn, is selling to Canadian Natural Resources, valued at about $36bn. Conoco, worth $62bn, is selling to Cenovus Energy, valued at about $8bn.The cash position of the oil sands industry is looking better this year than it has done at any time since the 1990s, according to Jackie Forrest of ARC Financial. Production will keep growing for a while, too, as new projects ramp up. But those Canadian companies will not have the same access to capital as the international groups they are replacing, and will not be able to finance investment so easily.Speaking at the CERAWeek conference in Houston last month, Justin Trudeau, Pierre’s son and Canada’s prime minister, described oil sands development as inevitable. “No country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there,” he said. The oil industry’s “Canexit”, however, will make it more difficult to get them out.ed.crooks@ft.com
33;COP;Conocophillips;2017-03-31T23:09:03Z;US companies defy investors with switch to online annual meetings;Ford says it will join growing list of ‘forward-looking’ groups ending in-person event;The number of US companies scrapping the traditional annual shareholder meeting and hosting the event online has surged in the past 18 months, in defiance of complaints from investors.Corporate giants Ford and ConocoPhillips are among those switching to “virtual” meetings this year, in a move they say makes it possible for more shareholders to take part and ask questions.Opponents, however, say directors are using technology to hide from the small shareholders and activists who have enlivened corporate meetings for generations.According to Broadridge, the investor services company whose software is used for virtual shareholder meetings, 184 US companies will hold online meetings in the first six months of this year, a one-third increase on the period in 2016.HP, JetBlue, Sprint, Fitbit and PayPal are among those to have switched to virtual meetings. The number of companies holding online-only events was 155 last year, with a further 32 testing the waters by holding an in-person meeting as well as a virtual event.Ford announced on Friday that it was joining “a growing list of forward-looking companies” by ending its in-person shareholder meeting. “The virtual nature of the meeting will enable us to increase shareholder accessibility, while improving meeting efficiency and reducing costs,” said Bill Ford, chairman.Broadridge is marketing its software as a way to broaden access to people who cannot afford to travel and as a way of cutting expenses, such as the security bills some companies must pay for contentious meetings.The decision by Duke Energy, the largest utility in the US, to switch to a virtual meeting this year, was criticised by As You Sow, a shareholder group that has put a resolution on the agenda demanding information on pollution from its coal-fired power plants.“They do not want to face the folks they have harmed,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow. “Our goal is to make the board understand how important these issues are but, if you are so many voices on a webinar, you lose the impact of the message. It feels like they are running away from their shareholders.”Duke’s 2016 meeting included emotional speeches from residents affected by spills from ash basins at the company’s coal-fired power plants in North Carolina. The company said it continued to meet environmental groups at other times and the virtual meeting would allow it to take more questions from more shareholders.ConocoPhillips said it would take live questions from shareholders online and on the phone. “We are excited to embrace the latest technology to provide ease of access, real-time communication and cost savings for our stockholders and the company,” it said.The Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension funds and other large US shareholders, opposes virtual-only meetings, saying companies should also provide the opportunity for shareholders to attend in person.“If it is a non-event, and not a lot of people attend, then there is not a lot of cost,” said Ken Bertsch, executive director of the CII. “If it is an event and a lot of people attend — well, then it is an event that should be held.”The rise of virtual meetings has reignited debate over when and how they should be operated, prompting the formation of a group to design a code of best practice. It includes representatives of investors such as Calstrs and Capital Group and companies including Microsoft.A similar working group in 2012 failed to bridge the divide between investors and companies on when virtual-only meetings were acceptable, and concentrated instead on how companies should organise question and answer sessions.
34;COP;Conocophillips;2017-03-30T18:24:20Z;ConocoPhillips rallies as Wall Street cheers oil sands sale;;ConocoPhillips was on track to post its biggest rally in four months as investors applauded its sale of oil-sands assets that will help the energy group cut its debt load.The Texas-based company’s share price roared 7.4 per cent higher in mid-day trading in New York to its highest level since February 15.ConocoPhillips revealed late on Wednesday a deal to sell a large swath of its oil sands assets to Canada’s Cenovus Energy. The move will substantially reduce ConocoPhillips’s production of the type of crude that is more complex and expensive to drill for than shale oil — an important factor given the fall in oil prices since 2014.Analysts at UBS upgraded their rating for ConocoPhillips to “buy” from “neutral” on the heels of the decision to divest the “low growth, low margin asset”. As a result, the analysts said, ConocoPhillips will be able to reduce its debt by about $7bn and double its share buyback programme.Alex Topouzoglou, an energy specialist in Stifel’s trading division, added that “this continues [ConocoPhillips's] refocus to the US onshore [market] and marks the exit or partial [exit] from Canada from yet another international player”.Investors had quite the opposite reaction to Cenovus’s decision to pick up the assets, sending its shares plummeting 12.6 per cent in Toronto trading and putting the stock on track for its worst-ever trading day.Benny Wong, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said that the price of the deal was “not as sweet as recent industry oil sands deals”. However, Mr Wong reckons that the pact still provides a “number of strategic benefits”.
35;COP;Conocophillips;2017-03-30T16:22:15Z;Cenovus/Conoco: filthy lucre;Oil sands projects carry risks but offer hopes of trapped value;Cenovus is the latest local specialist to exploit the eagerness of energy majors to shed exposure to Canada’s oil sands. It has doubled down on the dirty end of the oil business by buying out partner Conoco from projects for $13.3bn.This marks the second time in a month foreign oil companies have sold Canadian oil sands holdings. Smaller local explorers must see value in these projects which others cannot.Especially when the seller is under pressure. Conoco’s shares have trailed those of US peers by 10 percentage points over three years. By the end of last year, Conoco’s net debts of over $23bn exceeded earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by nearly 5 times. Conoco will use sale proceeds to reduce these liabilities. It is selling some of the family silver to do so. Christina Lake and Foster Creek in Alberta are two of the lowest cost oil sands projects, using steam to extract the oil.Cenovus has its own issues with high debt. So it will issue $2.2bn of equity to help pay for this affordably priced deal. Its shares fell a tenth on Thursday, half the dilution threat. The transaction lifts its modest exposure to production partly to blame for poor performance.Conoco will get a share of higher profits from the projects if the oil price rises much more. Royal Dutch Shell, which sold its project to Canadian Natural Resources, opted for similar insurance. Both may fear that the worst has passed for oil sands, where low prices depressed margins. Total of France and Norway’s Statoil, have also retreated from tarry terrain recently.The slogan “local jobs for local people” smacks of pragmatism rather than xenophobia in relation to the oil sands. These complex projects are fraught with operational and environmental risk. Better for specialist operators to handle them. Better for investors to fund them separately from energy conglomerates. Both have an opportunity to release trapped value.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
36;COP;Conocophillips;2017-03-30T00:42:11Z;ConocoPhillips sells oil sands assets for $13.3bn;Deal is third this month of international groups selling to Canadian specialists;ConocoPhillips of the US has become the third company this month to announce a large sale of assets in the oil sands of western Canada, agreeing a $13.3bn deal with Calgary-based Cenovus Energy for heavy crude and gas operations.Houston-based ConocoPhillips said the sale would enable it to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders, and also cut the average cost of its production from about $40 to about $35 per barrel.The deal follows Royal Dutch Shell’s decision, announced earlier this month, to sell most of its oil sands assets to Canadian Natural Resources for $7.25bn.Marathon Oil of the US sold its Canadian subsidiary, which owns 20 per cent of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, for $2.5bn to Shell and Canadian Natural Resources in a related deal.All three deals involve international companies selling operations in the oil sands to Canadian companies that are specialists in that industry.Shell said Alberta’s oil sands had ceased to be a priority in its investment plans, which were focused on deep water developments and petrochemicals. Conoco similarly said it was making sure that its capital spending was focused on its lowest cost and most profitable operations.Conoco will retain one oil sands asset: a 50 per cent stake in the Surmont joint venture with Total of France. But heavy Canadian crude will drop from 15 per cent to 5 per cent of its production.The deal received an initially favourable reaction from the market, with Conoco shares rising 5.8 per cent in after-hours trading in New York.Under the deal, Conoco will sell its 50 per cent stake in the Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands partnership and the majority of its western Canada Deep Basin gas assets to Cenovus. The Canadian company already owns the other half of Foster Creek Christina Lake.Conoco will receive $10.6bn in cash and 208m Cenovus shares, valued at $2.7bn on March 28. There is also a small extra payment triggered if the oil price goes high enough: Conoco will be paid an extra $6m for every C$1 of the benchmark Western Canada Select oil price above C$52 per barrel, every quarter for five years.The cash will be used to pay down its gross debt from $27bn at the end of last year to $20bn at the end of 2017, and for a $3bn share buyback.Conoco was forced to cut its dividend last year because of its strained financial position. Ryan Lance, chief executive, said the Canadian asset sale would “make us a much stronger company and put us in an advantaged position for strong free cash flow generation and improved returns”.The moves by international companies to reduce their exposure to the oil sands do not look like a sign that the industry is stagnating, at least in the near term.The International Energy Agency, the watchdog backed by rich countries’ governments, said earlier this month that it expected Canada to “remain a key contributor” to global oil supply growth over the next few years.It highlighted production ramp-ups at Conoco’s Surmont project and Cenovus’s Foster Creek as two of the principal developments driving that production growth.
37;COP;Conocophillips;2017-03-29T20:54:37Z;ConocoPhillips to sell some Canada assets to Cenovus for $13bn;;"ConocoPhillips has forged a deal to sell some of its Canadian portfolio to Cenovus for $13.3bn, the latest move by a large energy company to pull away from oil sands projects.Texas-based ConocoPhillips said it will sell its 50 per cent stake in the Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands partnership as part of the pact. The company will also sell the majority of its western Canada Deep Basin gas assets as part of the deal.The group’s shift away from oil sands, which typically face higher breakeven crude prices than shale prospects available elsewhere in North America, follows a similar decision earlier this month by Royal Dutch Shell.ConocoPhillips will receive $10.6bn in cash, and 208m Cenovus shares, which were valued at $2.7bn on March 28.Cenovus, an integrated energy group based in Canada, has significant expertise in dealing with the complexities of drilling in oil sands. That has become particularly important with oil prices hovering around $50 a barrel — a far cry from the levels north of $100 recorded before the tumble in 2014.“This is a significant, win-win opportunity for ConocoPhillips and Cenovus,”
said ConocoPhillips chief executive Ryan Lance.Mr Lance said the deal would have “an immediate and significant impact” on the group’s target of reducing its debt load to $20bn. ConocoPhillips said it would put the cash proceeds from the sale towards paying back its debt, as well as increasing the level and pace of share buybacks.ConocoPhillips shares rallied 5.7 per cent in after-hours trading in New York."
38;COP;Conocophillips;2017-02-02T12:34:02Z;ConocoPhillips posts smaller than expected quarterly loss;;ConocoPhillips of the US, the world’s largest oil and gas group with only exploration and production operations, reported a smaller loss than expected for the fourth quarter of 2016, and highlighted its potential to make profitable investments in its business at low oil prices, but projected only slow growth in production this year.The underlying loss per share for the quarter, excluding some one-off items, was 26 cents, compared to a loss of 90 cents for the equivalent period of 2015. Analysts had on average forecast a loss of 40 cents.The results contrast with the fourth quarter reports from ExxonMobil and Chevron, the two largest US oil and gas groups, which both released disappointing earnings for the fourth quarter of last year.Conoco’s shares fell more than 60 per cent in the oil price crash, to a low point in February last year after it cut its dividend, but have risen 24 per cent over the past 12 months as crude has recovered.Ryan Lance, chief executive, said the company’s recent performance “highlights the significant changes we’ve made as a company to respond to a world of lower and more volatile commodity prices.”He added:For the second quarter in a row our cash from operating activities exceeded capital expenditures and dividends paid. Our capital intensity and cost structure are dramatically lower, we’ve increased our dividend, and our debt reduction and share buyback programs are underway. We are delivering our operational milestones and our 18 BBOE of resources with an average cost of supply less than $40 per barrel Brent represents a deep source of high-return future investments.Conoco cut capital spending by more than 50 per cent to $4.9bn last year, and cut production and operating expenses by 19 per cent.Production for 2016, excluding the Libyan operations that have been hit by disruption in that country, dropped slightly to 1.57m barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from 1.59m b/d in 2015.For 2017, the company expects capital spending to be roughly unchanged at $5bn, it said.It also projected average production outside Libya of 1.54m-1.57m b/d this year, representing growth of 0-2 per cent allowing for the effect of asset sales.
39;COP;Conocophillips;2016-11-10T19:18:53Z;ConocoPhillips plans cautious increase in 2017 oil output;World’s largest pure exploration and production group forecasts capital spending cut;ConocoPhillips, one of the largest US oil and gas producers, plans to increase output by no more than 2 per cent next year, in a sign of how many companies are only cautiously stepping up activity following the stabilisation of crude prices.Setting out its plans for the coming year in a presentation to investors, Conoco said it planned capital spending of $5bn next year, slightly less than its 2016 budget of $5.2bn. It emphasised that its priorities, ranked in order, were maintaining production, paying a growing dividend, cutting its debts, buying back shares and only then investing for growth. It is also seeking to sell assets worth $5bn-$8bn, principally gasfields, to raise money to cut debts and fund share buybacks. Ryan Lance, chief executive, told investors he expected a world of “lower, more volatile prices”. “Not long ago, we enjoyed — as an industry — pretty high and stable prices. But that world has changed. “You can’t count on rising commodity prices to bail out your business model. You have to position your business for the cycle.” He added that the company had “shifted our mindsets to be a business that is managed for free cash flow”, making it more resilient to downturns in the cycle. Conoco, which is the world’s largest pure exploration and production company, has been through a turbulent period following the collapse in oil prices. It cut its dividend in February, having previously said that maintaining the payout was its top priority, and its shares have lost about half their value since July 2014. You can’t count on rising commodity prices to bail out your business model. You have to position your business for the cycleBrent crude has risen 69 per cent from its low point in January, and has been reasonably steady in a range of about $42-$52 per barrel since May. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the US has been rising steadily, and some North American producers such as EOG Resources have been talking about stepping up activity and increasing production next year. Mr Lance said the company’s plans would allow it to achieve its priorities at a Brent price of $50 per barrel, including cutting its debts, which will be about $27bn at the end of this year, to $20bn by the end of 2019. Even at slightly lower prices of $45-$50, he added, the company could still maintain production and increase the dividend, while paying off some debt. At prices above $50, he said, “we’ll have the cash to make choices”: between buying back shares and investing in projects for production growth. In its presentation, Conoco gave several examples of the ways that its business has gone through a “transformation” over the past few years to adjust to lower oil and gas prices. In 2014, it needed crude to be above $75 per barrel to be able to cover its capital spending and dividends from its cash flow. Now that price is down to $50.Much of the change has come from large strategic decisions, including cutting the dividend, pulling out of deep water exploration, and not embarking on any more large projects such as the recently completed APLNG liquefied natural gas plant. But there have also been significant operational improvements. Conoco said it had cut the number of days needed to drill a well in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas in half since 2013, for example.
40;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConocoPhillips to sell up to $8bn in assets, sets $3bn buyback;;ConocoPhillips has announced plans to sell an additional $5bn-$8bn in assets, with the US oil and gas producer looking to shore up its finances as the slump in oil prices drags on into its second year.The company said in a statement ahead of its investors’ day meeting that the asset sale will focus primarily on its North American natural gas fields. It also announced a $3bn share buyback programme – which at Wednesday’s closing price would be equivalent to about 5.3 per cent of its market value.“The acceleration actions we’ve announced today will allow us to achieve our value proposition priorities at Brent prices of about $50 per barrel,” said Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive officer.“These priorities include a debt target of $20 billion, a 20 to 30 per cent payout of operating cash flows to shareholders, and modest production growth to drive margin and cash flow expansion. In setting out these priorities, our goal is to have strong resilience to low commodity prices with the ability to capture upside during periods of higher prices.”Conoco, which is the world’s largest oil exploration and production company without any refining or chemicals operations, also cut its planned capital spending for 2017 to $5bn, a 4 per cent drop from 2016 and less than a third of its $17.1bn outlay in 2014.Full year 2017 production is expected to be between 1.54m to 1.57m barrels of oil equivalent per day, which the company says results in flat to 2 per cent growth compared with expected full-year 2016 production of approximately 1.54m barrels of oil equivalent per day when adjusted for effect of asset sales.Shares in Conoco, down 2.1 per cent this year, were 0.1 per cent lower in pre-market trading.
41;COP;Conocophillips;2016-10-27T14:29:30Z;ConocoPhillips posts narrower than expected loss;Oil and gas group in stronger position than peers after solid performance;ConocoPhillips’ third-quarter earnings show the company is in a stronger financial position than many of its peers after cutting its dividend payments in February.The US oil and gas group was able to pay for its capital spending and its dividend out of its operating cash flow in the quarter, underlining how it is better placed to grow than its competitors that need to borrow to finance their drilling programmes.Conoco, Marathon Oil and Hess are among the US companies that will be able to increase their production next year without any additional borrowing, if oil stays at current levels of about $50, according to an analysis published by Wood Mackenzie on Thursday.Companies including Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern Energy will face falling production if they cut their capital spending to a level they can cover from their operating cash flows with $50 oil, Wood Mackenzie suggests.Conoco, which is the world’s largest oil exploration and production company without any refining or chemicals operations, benefits from having international assets including projects that are ramping up: its new Australia Pacific LNG liquefied natural gas plant and an expansion at its Surmont oil sand development in Canada.Once LNG plants or oil sands projects are in operation, they require less spending than US shale reserves, where the output from each well declines rapidly in the first few years, so companies need to keep bringing on new wells to maintain production.Kris Nicol of Wood Mackenzie said: “Conoco has got over the hill of major capital spending on new projects, and it will be reaping the benefit in 2017.”Conoco revised its planned capital spending for 2016 to $5.2bn, from its previous projection of $5.5bn. That is less than a third of its $17.1bn outlay in 2014.Earnings for the three months to September showed an underlying loss per share of 66 cents, hit by a fall in Conoco’s selling prices for its oil and gas compared with the equivalent period of last year. It was slightly better than the average analysts’ forecast of 69 cents.However, chief executive Ryan Lance said the company had “made great strides” in its efforts to cut costs so as to be profitable at lower oil prices, and to improve its balance sheet, and to “deliver differential performance as prices recover”.Production was 1.557m barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 4 per cent excluding the effect of asset sales and maintenance shutdowns, and the company revised up the midpoint of expected production for 2016 as a whole to 1.565m barrels of oil equivalent per day.The company’s shares rose more than 4 per cent to $43.75 following the third-quarter earnings report.In the past 12 months, Conoco’s shares have fallen 23 per cent. That is in line with peers such as Hess, which is down 18 per cent over the same period, and Marathon Oil, down 27 per cent. However it lags behind shares in some of the best performing US shale companies, including those of EOG Resources, which are up 6 per cent.
42;COP;Conocophillips;2016-10-27T11:29:44Z;ConocoPhillips posts narrower than expected loss;;"ConocoPhillips, the US oil and gas group, achieved its objective of covering its capital spending and dividend payments from its cash flows in the third quarter, putting the company in a stronger position than many of its peers.It has also cut its planned capital spending and operating costs for 2016, and increased its projected production.Earnings for the three months to September showed an underlying loss per share of 66 cents, worse than the 38 cent loss it reported for the equivalent period of 2015, but slightly better than the average analysts’ forecast of 69 cents.Conoco is the largest pure exploration and production company in the US, having spun off its refining, chemicals and pipeline operations in 2012 as Phillips 66.The lack of the more stable refining operations means its earnings are more reliant on oil and gas prices. The average selling price for Conoco’s oil and gas was $29.78 per barrel of oil equivalent, down from $32.87 in the equivalent period of 2015.Production was 1.557m barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 4 per cent excluding the effect of asset sales and maintenance shutdowns, driven by rising output from its Australia Pacific LNG liquefied natural gas plant in Australia, and its Surmont oil sands development in Canada.Ryan Lance, chief executive, said:Our focus throughout the year has been to lower our breakeven price, improve the balance sheet, position the company to generate free cash flow and deliver differential performance as prices recover. We’ve made great strides.Planned capital spending for the year has been cut from $5.5bn to $5.2bn, and the mid-point of expected production has been raised to 1.565m barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In the past 12 months, Conoco’s shares have fallen 23 per cent, compared to a 5 per cent rise for ExxonMobil and an 11 per cent rise for Chevron."
43;COP;Conocophillips;2016-10-20T12:04:45Z;Oil producers optimistic that the slump is over;But companies are divided over whether a supply crunch is coming after huge cuts;As several of the world’s top oil executives rolled up at a Mayfair hotel in London this week for an industry summit, Brent crude, their benchmark product, was trading at $52 per barrel — exactly same the level as a year ago.This might not seem like a cause for celebration. But, after the brutal retrenchment since prices collapsed from above $100 per barrel in mid-2014, the near 12-month highs of recent days have added to confidence that the worst is over for oil producers.“We are at the end of a considerable downturn,” said Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister and chairman of Saudi Aramco, the state-controlled oil company, at the annual Oil & Money conference. “The fundamentals are improving and the market is rebalancing.”His comments were echoed in London by executives, traders and investors from across the sector, reflecting the steady rise in optimism since members of Opec, the oil producers’ cartel led by Saudi, reached a provisional agreement last month to curb output. Brent has risen by 15 per cent in the past three weeks and by three-quarters since a 12-year low of less than $30 per barrel in January.There have been tentative signs of the upturn spurring renewed investment. A US explorer called Extraction Oil & Gas last week raised $644m in the biggest energy listing since the oil price crash. Meanwhile, the number of drilling rigs active worldwide — a proxy for exploration — has risen for the past four consecutive months after falling for most of the previous year.Recovery is clearest in the US, where the rig count is up by a quarter since May after declining by three-quarters since 2014. Activity is concentrated in shale oil and gas reserves which, owing to their relatively low costs and high flexibility, are being remobilised faster than conventional resources.It is too soon, however, to declare a wider resurgence of animal spirits in the oil and gas industry. Tom Ellacott, head of corporate research at Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy, says the deep investment freeze of the past two years will take longer to thaw beyond the onshore US. “The sector is moving beyond survival into the recovery phase. But companies are still cautious with a focus on capital discipline and cash flow.”The scale of the industry’s contraction has been epic in its proportions. Capital expenditure on exploration and production has fallen from about $700bn in 2014 to $400bn this year and, according to Wood Mac, $1tn of planned E&P work has been cancelled or deferred.The 2.7bn barrels of new reserves discovered last year was the smallest amount for almost 70 years and just a tenth of the long-term average. This year is on course to be even lower.The slump has led some industry leaders to warn of supply shortages in years ahead unless the brakes on spending are loosened. Saudi Arabia says the proposed action by Opec to put a floor under prices will help incentivise more drilling.Wood Mac estimates that 20m barrels a day of new production needs to be developed by 2025 to meet rising demand, and replace existing fields that are in decline. “There’s a crunch coming,” says Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered. “We need a signal to the market that more supply is needed.”Not everyone shares his sense of urgency. Several industry leaders told the London conference that the ability of US shale producers to quickly ramp up production would keep a ceiling on prices. Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said this meant that justifying big investments in conventional exploration would continue to be hard. “Those free-spending days are over,” he said, referring to the era of $100-per-barrel oil.Mr Lance and other executives described a shift away from high-risk, multiyear exploration in far-flung offshore frontiers — instead companies were focused on improving the efficiency of existing operations while looking to add new resources in places where infrastructure is already in place. “In the 1990s and 2000s the industry needed mega projects for growth,” said Mr Lance. “[Shale] oil has changed those economics. Companies are looking for shorter-cycle projects . . . you need the flexibility to throttle up and throttle down.”An example of this shift was BP’s decision last week to drop multibillion-dollar plans for a complex and environmentally contentious new development in the Great Australian Bight — a marine park off the south coast of Australia. Another big BP project called Mad Dog 2 in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to go-ahead, but it is an expansion of an existing field and its estimated cost has been cut from $20bn when first proposed to $9bn today. As Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, said: “Investments are back. But it’s only going to be the very best.”Royal Dutch Shell said offshore exploration could still be competitive provided costs were rigorously controlled. Andy Brown, head of Shell’s upstream business, said the oil price needed for some of the group’s new deepwater projects to be profitable had fallen from $70 per barrel to $45. Savings came from simplification and standardisation of designs and processes, and by driving a harder bargain with suppliers.“The mantra is value over volume,” said Mr Ellacott. “Projects will not get sanctioned unless they meet strict rates of return. We are going to see more activity but mainly in the real sweet spots, like offshore Brazil, where the economics are most attractive.”John Hess, chief executive of Hess Corporation, one of the largest independent US oil companies, said prices would have to reach between $60 and $80 per barrel before a wider resurgence in investment can take root. “If $100 was too high for the world, $50 is too low for the industry. It will have to be somewhere in between.”Weakness in the oil market has been bad for mergers and acquisitions because of the difficulty of reaching agreement on valuations. Buyers have demanded fire sale prices, while sellers have been holding out for better offers.Excluding Royal Dutch Shell’s $50bn takeover of BG Group unveiled last year — the industry’s only true megamerger of the past decade — the number of deals worth over $1bn fell from 46 in 2014 to only 14 in 2015. This was the lowest for over a decade, according to Wood Mackenzie. However, there has been a gradual upturn this year driven by renewed interest in US shale oil and gas.A $1.6bn deal on Tuesday for SM Energy to buy shale acreage in west Texas added to more than $30bn of M&A in US exploration and production in 2016. Half of it has come in the Permian basin, an area of Texas and New Mexico with among the country’s most economically attractive reserves.“Costs have come down so much that people in the productive basins like the Permian can make things work,” says Ian Taylor, chief executive of Vitol, the oil trading company. which sold a Texas crude terminal and pipeline system to Sunoco for $760m last month.Bankers say stabilisation in the oil market could encourage wider revival in M&A by narrowing the price gap between buyers and sellers. Several cash-rich private equity-backed investors are looking for assets in the North Sea and beyond, while some oil majors are under pressure to shed assets to shore up their balance sheets.As for acquisitions by majors, Statoil and ExxonMobil each struck deals worth $2.5bn in July to buy assets in Brazil and Papua New Guinea, respectively.However, executives say that, after a two-year clampdown on capital expenditure, they have plenty of in-house investment options before they go shopping outside for growth. One US executive expresses a preference to buy shale acreage rather than a whole company, saying many groups had significant debts.
44;COP;Conocophillips;2016-10-07T15:20:20Z;ConocoPhillips cries fraud over PDVSA bond swap;;ConocoPhillips has opened up a new front in its long-running fight against Venezuela over oil projects worth billions of dollars that were nationalised by the country’s leaders in 2007.In a lawsuit filed Thursday in US federal court in Delaware, ConocoPhillips, one of the world’s largest oil companies, accused Venezuela’s state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), of trying to shuffle assets to avoid paying up over the country’s confiscation and nationalisation of oil assets under the late President Hugo Chavez.Among those, ConocoPhillips contends, were an attempt to sell PDVSA’s US subsidiary Citgo in 2014, a $2.8bn Citgo bond offering last year, and a planned bond swap in which PDVSA has offered to exchange about $7bn in obligations due in 2016 for new notes maturing in 2020, for which PDVSA offered up slightly more than half of its interest in Citgo as collateral.“The purpose behind each of these transfers is the same: to remove assets from the United States to Venezuela, an/or to encumber assets in the United States, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud PDVSA’s and Venezuela’s arbitration award creditors, including ConocoPhillips,” the lawsuit said.More than 20 companies, including ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil, have gone to arbitration before the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes against Venezuela over the 2007 seizures of oil projects in which it had previously tapped companies to form long-term joint ventures.The tribunal ruled for ConocoPhillips in 2013, and while the amount of damages has not yet been decided, the company pegs it at “multiple billions of dollars,” according to the lawsuit. Two other Conoco subsidiaries are embroiled in related disputes before the same body, which are set to be decided in December. Venezuela has disputed that it did anything illegal.
45;COP;Conocophillips;2016-07-28T14:30:30Z;Shell misses expectations as profits plunge 72%;ConocoPhillips and Total also announce steep drops in earnings;Royal Dutch Shell appealed for investors’ patience after announcing a 72 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings as continued weakness in oil and gas prices battered the Anglo-Dutch group.The results were much worse than market expectations and added to the gloom hanging over the industry after weak numbers from BP and Statoil earlier in the week and a renewed dip in oil prices below $43 a barrel, the lowest level for three months.ConocoPhillips and Total also announced steep drops in earnings on Thursday, although the latter’s was less precipitous than analysts had feared.“The second quarter was incredibly challenging across the board,” said Iain Armstrong, analyst at Brewin Dolphin. “If oil prices don’t start improving in the third quarter the bears will start getting really aggressive again.”Shell’s results were especially disappointing for investors because it was the first full quarter after completion of its £35bn takeover of BG Group. The addition of BG assets helped lift production 28 per cent to 3.5m barrels of oil equivalent per day. But this was more than offset by the weak market conditions in which those products were sold.Shares in Shell were down 3.4 per cent at £19.75 on Thursday afternoon.On a current cost of supplies basis — the measure most closely watched by analysts — second-quarter earnings were $1.05bn, down from $3.76bn in the same period last year. Analysts’ consensus forecast had been for $2.2bn.Ben van Beurden, chief executive, admitted it was proving a difficult “transitional year” for Shell but insisted the group was making progress towards a more streamlined business that could deliver fresh growth in an era of lower oil prices.He said the group was on track to cut costs by 20 per cent by the end of this year, compared with the combined operating costs of Shell and BG in 2014. This year’s planned capital expenditure of $29bn, meanwhile, would be 38 per cent less than the pair jointly invested as standalone companies in 2014.The decision on Thursday to put on hold a multibillion-dollar liquefied national gas export facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana, was the latest example of the squeeze on spending.A combination of low prices and the BG acquisition have caused Shell’s debt to equity ratio to more than double in the past year to 28.1 per cent and Simon Henry, chief financial officer, warned it could edge closer to the group’s self-declared upper limit of 30 per cent.However, he said plans to raise $30bn from asset sales was progressing well, with 17 potential transactions worth $6bn-$8bn under way, two-thirds of them in the upstream exploration and production business.Jon Rigby, analyst at UBS, attributed the “disappointing” results to “much worse” than expected cash flow of $2.29bn, down from $6.1bn a year ago.Mr van Beurden said the big gap with market expectations reflected “a lot of noise and moving parts” caused by the integration with BG that had made it difficult for analysts to make accurate estimates. He said a cleaner picture of performance should emerge next year.Shell remained committed to defending its dividend, he added, with the payout held steady at 47 cents in the second quarter.Total reported a 30 per cent year-on-year fall in adjusted net income to $2.2bn, beating analysts’ consensus forecast for $1.89bn.Marc Kofler at Jefferies described the results as “resilient”, aided by strong cost controls.The French group said it was on course to exceed its target to cut costs by $2.4bn this year and aimed to generate $2bn from asset sales by the year end.Shares in Total were up 1.3 per cent at €43.24 on Thursday afternoon.ConocoPhillips, the largest pure exploration and production company in the energy sector, reported an adjusted net loss of $985m, or 79 cents a share, compared with a profit of $81m a year ago. Analysts’ consensus forecast had been for a loss of 61 cents a share.The US group said its production exceeded expectations in the second quarter and raised its output target for the year. But pressure from weak prices caused it to trim its 2016 capital expenditure budget for the third time from $5.7bn to $5.5bn.
46;COP;Conocophillips;2016-07-13T20:34:08Z;Juno Therapeutics surges as drug trial suspension lifted;US equities maintain ground after move into record territory as energy sector slips;Juno Therapeutics shares shot higher on Wednesday after a suspension of its experimental cancer treatment trial was lifted by the US Food and Drug Administration.Last week, the FDA ordered the Seattle-based company to halt the Phase II clinical trial of its drug, JCAR015, after two patient deaths. But Juno said late on Tuesday that the FDA removed the clinical hold on the trial in adult patients with a type of blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and revised the protocol for the treatment.The news spurred shares in Juno higher by 20 per cent to $33.19 at one point, but they later gave up some ground, closing the day 9.5 per cent higher at $30.42. The gains trimmed the share’s year-to-date losses to 30.8 per cent.Juno is among a group of companies developing a new type of cancer therapy, which involves extracting a patient’s white blood cells, modifying them in a laboratory so they can recognise and attack cancer, and then reinjecting them into the patient.“The rapid response from the FDA and the allowance of some flexibility [mid-trial] in the preconditioning regimen could be interpreted as an early signal that if the impressive rates of patient response and improvements in overall survival continue, as they have so far, the first CAR-T therapies . . . could gain approval as early as 2017,” said Jason McCarthy, analyst at Maxim Group.The advance in Juno shares arrived as US stocks struggled to hold on to their gains after the S&P 500 closed in record territory for the first two days of the trading week.At the close, the S&P 500 was little-changed at 2,152.4, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 18,372.1, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3 per cent to 5,005.7.Energy experienced the biggest decline among the S&P’s 10 major sectors, down 0.7 per cent, as an unexpected build in inventories of US gasoline pushed crude prices lower.Chesapeake Energy shares fell 5 per cent to $4.35 — the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 energy sector index. Meanwhile, Hess shares fell 3.5 per cent to $58.02, ConocoPhillips shares dropped 2.1 per cent to $42.87 and Halliburton shares declined 1.8 per cent to $45.21.Elsewhere, shares in Darden Restaurants slipped 0.2 per cent to $62.68 after analysts at Wells Fargo downgraded the company behind Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse to “market perform” from “outperform”.The downgrade was driven by a deterioration in same-store sales and the company’s plans to reinvest its cost savings, marking “a departure from FY16 when cost savings were dropped to the bottom line driving a five-quarter run of approximately 20 per cent EPS upside”, Jeff Farmer, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said.Elsewhere, shares in Host Hotels & Resorts fell 4 per cent to $16.48, after analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “neutral” and lowered their price target by $1 to $15.The cut was motivated in part by the company’s “high exposure to urban and gateway markets [specifically New York City], and therefore adverse supply growth, Airbnb and US dollar impact,” said Joseph Greff, an analyst at JPMorgan. The recent outperformance in Host’s shares compared to its peers and the S&P also prompted the cut from the bank.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
47;COP;Conocophillips;2016-06-12T10:22:16Z;Oil majors find virtue in integration;Slump in crude prices highlights benefits in owning upstream and downstream businesses;He was reporting record losses amid a prolonged industry downturn, and facing a big shareholder revolt against his 20 per cent pay rise. But Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, did manage to find one bright spot amid the gloom at the company’s annual meeting.“Not so long ago I used to hear a lot of advice about how we should separate out our downstream business and sell it off,” he told shareholders in April. “I don’t hear that so much any more.”Mr Dudley was reflecting what executives at the largest energy companies have been saying for the past year or so: that this downturn, the worst in 30 years, has vindicated the business model of the “vertically integrated” oil groups. These companies combine the upstream activities of finding and developing oilfields with downstream functions such as refining crude and selling petroleum products.As in many other industries, oil companies have been facing growing pressure to become more focused. However, since the collapse in crude prices began in mid-2014, that pressure has gone into abeyance. Low prices have crushed profits from oil and gas production, but helped refining and chemicals businesses, supporting integrated groups’ earnings.Yet while the questions over the value of integration may have eased off for a while, they are unlikely to have disappeared for good.There are two principal benefits from being an integrated company. One, in the words of Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, is that it “captures the highest value for every molecule that flows through our facilities”.As he explained it to analysts in March, Exxon can adjust its production to serve the most profitable markets.“We react more effectively and rapidly to changes in the business environment,” said Mr Tillerson. “Our global supply organisation utilises sophisticated demand planning and marketing tools that provide insights to achieve the best value for our upstream production.”The second professed benefit of the integrated model has come into focus during the oil slump: that owning both upstream and downstream businesses creates a hedge against a drop in the price of crude.In 2014, Royal Dutch Shell generated $16.5bn in profit from its upstream operations and $6.3bn downstream. The following year, the balance flipped: upstream earnings slumped to just $1.8bn, while downstream profits remained roughly flat, adjusting for one-off items.John Abbott, Shell’s head of downstream, says: “The business is very cyclical. Sometimes value will be in the upstream . . . sometimes it will be in the downstream. I’ve lost count, to be honest, over the last 35 years, how many times that has happened.”Weak oil prices helped refiners last year as crude fell faster than the value of refined products, boosting margins. BP reported average refinery margins of $17 a barrel last year, up 18 per cent compared with 2014.For more than 20 years, both of those putative benefits derived from integration have been challenged.Advocates for break-up accepted downstream profits could provide stability during an oil price slump, but argued the costs of the added complexity outweighed the benefits.They also pointed out physical integration — companies refining their own crude — was dwindling. Frederic Choumert of Roland Berger suggests most large international companies might run only 20 per cent of their production through their own refineries.The financial crisis subdued those break-up calls for a while, but as markets recovered the pressure re-emerged. In 2011, researchers at Oppenheimer argued large US oil groups could raise their valuations 20 per cent by spinning off their refining and marketing operations.A few US companies acted on those recommendations. Marathon Oil spun off its downstream operations as Marathon Petroleum in 2011, and ConocoPhillips did the same with Phillips 66 in 2012.Under pressure from Elliott Associates, an activist investor, Hess sold off its terminals and pulled out of refining in 2013, to focus on production.At first glance, the slump in oil prices since 2014 might seem to have made those moves look rash. In the past two years, Hess shares have dropped by 34 per cent, Conoco’s by 41 per cent and Marathon Oil’s by 61 per cent.But adding in the performance of the spun off refining businesses, the break-ups do not look like big mistakes. The weighted average total shareholder return for Conoco and Phillips 66 since the 2012 split, including dividends, has been 40 per cent. Over the same period. Chevron’s total shareholder return has been 12 per cent and Exxon’s 18 per cent.Mr Choumert argues if oil companies want to remain in upstream and downstream activities, they have to show investors there are real advantages to the model, whether in terms of scale and financial strength, or in physical integration.Some companies have been responding to those concerns. BP has restructured its US downstream operations, selling two refineries, to focus on those that are closely linked to its marketing businesses.Tufan Erginbilgic, BP’s head of downstream, says: “We are trying to create differentiated business models so we can generate differentiated returns . . . Then we are not going to have one good month for the company and another month not good.”Some companies are even expanding their downstream operations. Total is planning to get involved in building more liquefied natural gas terminals and power plants, to drive demand for the gas it produces.None of this, however, means the argument for splitting up vertically integrated companies has gone for good, not least because refining margins have slipped back again this year.Occo Roelofsen, a senior partner at McKinsey, which has published multiple papers in the past advocating break-up, says the argument looks weaker now.“The debate has shifted because large companies have improved their performance and lowered their costs during the downturn more than we thought,” he says.Mr Choumert, however, thinks there will still be pressure for change, especially at smaller integrated companies such as Repsol of Spain.“I would not be surprised if there is a move made on them to try to get them to realign their business.”The arguments over what segments of the oil value chain belong in the same company stretch back more than 150 years.John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil took control of the US oil business in the 1870s by dominating the refining and transport industries, which gave him leverage over the fragmented production companies, but it was not initially a significant producer.Standard subsequently acquired more wells, and by the end of the century accounted for 32 per cent of US crude output, according to Ron Chernow in Titan, his magisterial biography of Rockefeller. Even so, Standard’s position in the upstream industry was always weaker than its grip on refining and transport. At the time of its break-up in 1911, it owned 70 per cent of US refining capacity, but only 14 per cent of its crude productionIn the 1950s and 60s, when the cartel of large western companies known as “the seven sisters” controlled the global market, owning the entire value chain helped them maintain their dominance.In the 1960s and 70s, though, the oil-producing countries of the Middle East and North Africa took control of their industries with a series of nationalisations. Western companies were forced to range further afield in search of reserves, to Alaska, sub-Saharan Africa and central Asia, and as they did so their refineries became increasingly distant from their wells, according to Richard Forrest of AT Kearney.The emergence of a truly liquid global spot market for crude in the 1980s made it less important for companies to lock up supply chains internally to ensure reliable flows of crude. Physical integration — companies processing their own crude in their refineries — went into decline.
48;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Statoil and Chevron lead pack in securing Norwegian oil licences;Fierce competition to explore new areas demonstrates hunger for further sources of revenue;Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Statoil have all secured licences to drill for oil off the coast of Norway, as companies target new resources to make up for losses elsewhere.Some of the world’s biggest oil companies bid for rights in the country’s 23rd licensing round, which allocated areas in the Barents Sea, closer to the Arctic than before. Some are also in an area previously disputed with Russia.On Wednesday, the Norwegian government announced it had granted 10 licences to a range of companies, with the country’s own domestic producers being among the biggest winners.State-backed Statoil will become the operator of four of the licences, while Lundin, the Swedish company that discovered the Johan Sverdrup field in 2010, will take charge of three.Other groups to win a stake in one or more fields include US oil companies Chevron and ConocoPhillips, as well as Centrica, the UK utility which is selling many of its oil and gas assets elsewhere.Other multinational companies fared less well, however. Both BP, the international oil company, and Eon bid for licences but were not granted any.Tord Lien, the Norwegian energy minister, said: “The Barents Sea offers great, new opportunities. The industry’s interest in new acreage shows that the Norwegian continental shelf remains attractive.“The potential is huge. If the companies are successful in their exploration, northern Norway will enter a new era.”The results show that large oil companies are still interested in exploring in new areas, despite the collapse in the oil price since 2014. Oil hit a low earlier this year of $28 a barrel, down from $115 two years ago. But in recent months prices have recovered slightly, with a barrel of Brent crude now trading around $50.The North Sea is one of the oldest oil basins in the world, with oil output from Norway having fallen by half since 2000. But in recent years there have been more discoveries in the Norwegian part of the sea — including Johan Sverdrup — than in the British portion.The latest push for exploration rights suggests that even though many companies have had to make heavy writedowns on their existing assets, they are still looking for new sources of revenue.Victoria McCulloch, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “The big prizes in Norwegian oil are still in the Barents Sea — it is very under-explored.But the move has also been controversial with environmental campaigners, who point out that Norway was one of five Nordic countries which recently agreed with the US to re-evaluate its drilling programme in the Arctic.Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway, said: “New exploration licenses in the Barents Sea are in no way sustainable, either for the marine environment or the climate. Parliament should stop these licenses.”
49;COP;Conocophillips;2016-04-28T14:12:16Z;Conoco slashes rigs numbers and spending;Pressure in oil industry remains intense despite rebound in prices;ConocoPhillips has slashed the number of rigs it has drilling for oil and gas in the US and made a further reduction in its planned capital spending for the year, as it seeks to cut costs to keep its rising debts under control.The move is a sign of how even after the recent rebound in oil prices from their lows in January and February, the financial pressure on the industry remains intense. Conoco, which is the world’s largest pure exploration and production company, said it had cut the number of rigs it had running in the “lower 48” states of the contiguous US from 13 at the end of 2015 to just three in April. It also cut its planned capital spending for 2016 for a second time, to $5.7bn. In December it set a budget for this year of $7.7bn, and reduced that in February to $6.4bn. The cuts reflect reduced deepwater exploration — which Conoco plans to give up entirely from next year — projects being put on hold and lower costs.The company told analysts on a call that it had no plans “to add any rigs beyond the three that we are running in the lower 48 in 2016”. The sharp slowdown in drilling is expected to lead to a 10 per cent cut in Conoco’s production in the lower 48 states this year, although the company plans to offset that with growth elsewhere to keep its total output roughly steady.Conoco made the announcements as it reported an underlying loss of $1.2bn for the first quarter, a period when oil prices hit their lowest levels for more than 12 years. It sold its oil at an average price of $31.47 per barrel for the quarter, compared to $48.05 for the equivalent period of 2015.Its cash from operations of $421m fell well short of its capital spending of $1.8bn for the quarter. Net debt has risen 24 per cent over the past 12 months to $24.6bn at the end of March. In February Conoco announced a 66 per cent cut in its dividend to save cash. It also issued $4.5bn in debt in the first quarter, including bonds with maturities ranging from five years to 30 years, strengthening the company’s liquidity. Ryan Lance, chief executive, said those moves would “position the company for strong performance as prices improve”. He added: “As challenging as this price downturn has been, we are a much stronger company for the long term.” Executives told analysts that as oil prices recover “our first priority is going to be to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce our debt”.Even if prices are higher, the company said, new investment in production would have to compete with other uses of capital, such as share buybacks.In January Conoco began deliveries of liquefied natural gas from its new Australia Pacific LNG plant in Queensland, and loaded 11 cargoes in the quarter, but in spite of that the group’s production was down 2 per cent at 1.58m barrels of oil equivalent per day, because of natural decline in fields and some asset sales. For the full year, Conoco reiterated its previous guidance that production would be 1.525m barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line with last year’s output adjusted for the effect of asset sales.

Analysts had been braced for a loss of 97 cents a share, on sales of $6.2bn.A renaissance in US shale oil production that helped drive a more than 60 per cent drop in crude prices since mid-2014 has weighed heavily on the top and bottom lines of energy companies and prompted them to cut jobs, lower capital spending and even axe their dividend.ConocoPhillips said last year it would pull out of deepwater exploration altogether by 2017. The company also slashed its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share, from 74 cents a share, earlier this year*.On Thursday, the group said its decision to reduce capital expenditure this year was “primarily driven by reduced deepwater exploration activity, deferrals and lower costs across the portfolio”.ConocoPhillips shares have declined 30 per cent since the beginning of 2015.Note: The post was amended to reflect quarterly dividend cut, instead of annual dividend cut.
51;COP;Conocophillips;2016-04-24T20:01:21Z;Offshore rig operators reel from oil price rout;Seadrill, Ensco and others report losses as producers curtail costly projects;In the depths of the ocean off the coast of Uruguay, more than two miles below sea level, the oil industry is continuing to push back the frontier.Last month a drillship operated by AP Møller-Maersk of Denmark began the Raya 1 well in 3,411 metres of water, breaking the record for sea depth previously set in 2013.Drilling in such extreme conditions is a remarkable feat, but wells such as Raya 1 are becoming increasingly rare. Technology makes them possible, but economics militates against them.Further coverage of the far-reaching implications of the protracted slump in oil pricesFor the companies that operate offshore rigs on behalf of oil producers — including Transocean, Seadrill, Ensco and Noble Corp — the slump in crude prices since the summer of 2014 has been brutal. They have been reporting large losses, and have cut or scrapped their dividends. Their share prices have plunged.The impact of low oil prices is often depicted as a battle between Saudi Arabia and the onshore shale producers of the US. But other relatively high-cost sources of supply around the world have also been hit, and for offshore oil the effect is likely to last longer.The latest data for offshore oil and gas production still look healthy. Last year output from the UK sector of the North Sea rose 7 to 8 per cent, while crude production in the US waters of the Gulf of Mexico rose 10 per cent.That growth is the result of decisions taken years ago, however. Matt Cook of Douglas-Westwood, a consultancy, says that because offshore projects take years to develop, the impact of falling oil prices is felt only after a lag.“This hasn’t yet got as bad as it could well be,” he adds. “Some of the positive moves we have seen in drilling are the result of decisions that were committed to before the downturn. It’s quite possible that the worst is yet to come.”The number of drillships and “semi-submersible” floating rigs working around the world has dropped from 251 in September 2014 to 169 last month, according to the RigLogix database from Rigzone, a research firm.Only a handful of new offshore projects were given the green light last year, including Royal Dutch Shell’s Appomattox in the Gulf of Mexico, Eni’s OCTP off the coast of Ghana, and Statoil’s Johan Sverdrup field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.Even more ominously for the contractors, many oil producers have cut back sharply on exploration to find fields that will lead to future developments. ConocoPhillips of the US said last year it would pull out of deepwater exploration altogether by 2017.Paal Kibsgaard, chief executive of Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, on Friday told analysts that its customers showed signs of “facing a full-scale cash crisis”, and in the second quarter their spending was likely to be even lower than in the first three months of 2016.One particular weak spot for Schlumberger was sales of offshore seismic survey data — essential for exploration — which Mr Kibsgaard said had fallen to “unprecedented low levels”.With cash flows under extreme pressure, and commitments to investors that dividends will not be cut, oil companies see little benefit in spending money on exploration that might at best pay off in production 10 years from now.The slowdown in both exploration for new fields and the development of past discoveries is causing particular difficulties for those rig operators that are heavily indebted.For example, Seadrill’s net debt was 4.7 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2013, before oil prices slumped, and at the end of 2015 the company’s leverage had increased to 5.4 times.Noble and Transocean have had their credit ratings cut from investment grade to junk status as a result of the downturn.Jeremy Thigpen, the new chief executive of Transocean, stressed the company’s financial strength and its ability to ride out the downturn at a conference last month.But Transocean’s regular fleet status report last week showed that of its 28 rigs capable of working in “ultra deep” waters, just 12 were under contract, with the rest “stacked” or idle.Not every company is turning away from offshore oil and gas. Total is leading the Raya 1 project in Uruguay. Shell said the potential for growth in deep water off Brazil was a central reason for its £35bn takeover of BG Group.Although offshore and especially deepwater oil is expensive, the fields found can be very large. So the cost per barrel is not necessarily higher than for US shale, says Amrita Sen of Energy Aspects, a consultancy.The big difference, however, is in flexibility. Offshore, a well might cost $100m and take many weeks to drill, while onshore it will cost about $5m to $7m and take less than two weeks.That means shale operations can be adjusted quickly to respond to changing market conditions. If you commit to a big offshore project, you are pretty well stuck with it, even if falling commodity prices make it uneconomic.“The problem is not just that oil is at $45,” says Ms Sen. “It’s that you just can’t be certain of anything.”ExxonMobil told investors last month that it was pursuing “several” offshore development opportunities. However, executives also stressed the flexibility of its US onshore assets, which would allow them to ramp up production quickly if oil process rise.Mr Kibsgaard of Schlumberger suggested on Friday that this would be a common view across the industry. Large new offshore projects, he said, were “not going to be the first area that our customers are going to start putting money into“.When the recovery comes, he added, investment will pick up onshore first and offshore — and especially in deep water — only later.That means the financial pressures on the rig companies will continue, potentially with significant low-term consequences.Keeping a modern drillship “hot stacked” — ready to move off to a job if needed — can cost $150,000 per day, according to Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrross, an energy technology start-up. That creates an incentive for the operators to scrap or sell rigs, rather than retain them to wait for the upturn.There is a widespread expectation that as oil prices recover, the US shale industry will spring back to life. If, for whatever reason, that fails to happen, then it will take a long time for the offshore industry to be revved up to fill the gap. The result could be a surge in oil and gas prices, at least for a while.“This is a dangerous game for the industry,” says Mr Rostand. “The knock-on effect of reduced activity on the industry will be prolonged.”This is the seventh part of a Financial Times series entitled Oil: Lower for longer, looking at the consequences of the fall in crude prices.Although most of the news for the offshore oil industry is bad, there is one silver lining: projects that were prohibitively expensive might now be able to go ahead, because costs have fallen so far.BP’s proposed Mad Dog 2 project in the Gulf of Mexico, an extension to the Mad Dog development that started production in 2005, originally fell victim to soaring costs.The original complex design was rejected back in 2013, even before oil and gas prices started their big fall, because its sky-high costs made it financially unattractive.Engineers from BP and its junior partners in the development, Chevron and BHP Billiton, went away and came up with a new plan, and with the help of the extra leverage provided by the slump in oil prices the cost of the project has been cut in half.Lamar McKay, BP’s deputy chief executive, said at the IHS CeraWeek conference in February that the original estimate of the cost of Mad Dog 2 had been $20bn, and it was now less than $10bn.The new design would be more profitable with oil at $60 per barrel than the old one would have been at $100, he added.However, although BP says that the project is now commercially attractive and will go ahead at some point, it has still not actually made the commitment to invest in it.As Mr McKay told the Financial Times in February: “The project will be sanctioned. It’s just a question of when.”

The New York-based company expects full-year earnings between $6.05 to $6.35 a share, compared with analysts’ estimates of $6.11.The news came alongside fourth-quarter profits that climbed to $243m, or $1.19 a share, compared with $214.6m, or $1.06 a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 14 per cent to $1.5bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.15 a share, on sales of $1.5bn.Rob Sands, chief executive of Constellation, said the company’s Canadian business “delivered excellent overall financial results, outperformed the industry and gained market share, and we believe its full value is not being recognised”. He added that an IPO could “create better visibility” and that a final decision on pursuing the plans would be made this year.The rally in Constellation’s shares accompanied a broader advance in the US stock market. At the close, the S&P 500 had advanced 1.1 per cent to 2,067, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 17,716. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6 per cent to 4,921.The S&P 500 telecoms sector widely underperformed the broader market, sliding 1 per cent.AT&T and Verizon Communications, the group’s two largest components, began trading “ex-dividend” on Wednesday, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That means investors who buy the stock now will not receive the combined $5.3bn in quarterly dividends that each are set to pay in May.AT&T slipped 0.2 per cent to $38.64, while Verizon was unchanged at $53.52.Still, telecoms have been the top performers this year, rallying 13.8 per cent against a market that has tilted higher by just over 1 per cent. Investors have scooped up the stocks for their juicy dividend yields as US Treasury bond yields have remained under pressure from a more cautious stance on rate rises by Federal Reserve policymakers than was expected at the beginning of 2016.Energy shares advanced on the back of a sharp rally in the price of oil. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, climbed 5.2 per cent to $37.75 a barrel as American crude inventories posted their second-biggest weekly drop of the year.ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly traded energy group, rose 1.3 per cent to $83.31. ConocoPhillips, a large exploration and production company, rallied 4.4 per cent to $40.74.Elsewhere, shares in Wynn Resorts fell 1.5 per cent to $89.55 after the casino operator said a slowdown in Macau weighed on its quarterly results.Wynn said preliminary net revenues in the region were projected to be between $603m to $613m in the first quarter, down from $705m in the year-ago quarter.The decline in Macau monthly gross gaming revenues picked up steam in March, falling 16.3 per cent, following a muted 0.1 per cent decline the previous month, according to Macau’s Gaming Inspection, and Coordination Bureau.
53;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors have renewed appetite for energy bonds;Strong interest reported in Anadarko offering, following debt issuance by two other US groups;Investors showed signs of regaining their appetite for energy companies’ bonds following the recent rally in oil prices.Orders for a bond offering from Anadarko Petroleum, the US oil producer, exceeded $20bn on Monday, covering underwriter books more than six times, according to three people familiar with the transaction.Anadarko, which last year made an unsuccessful takeover approach to Apache, another US producer, will use the proceeds from the $3bn offering to refinance debt that matures later this year and next.The plunge in the price of Brent crude to a 13-year low of $27 per barrel in January slowed new debt offerings by energy companies to a trickle at the start of the year.But Brent has since rebounded about 45 per cent to more than $40, restoring market access for groups with the best credit ratings. On Monday, Brent was trading at $39.50, down 2 per cent.ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, rated triple A and single A respectively by Standard & Poor’s, have both completed multibillion-dollar bond offerings in the past two weeks.The strong showings for those bonds buoyed confidence that demand would materialise for the sale by Anadarko, despite it having split ratings among the three major credit agencies.Moody’s, which downgraded Anadarko to junk status last month, warned that the company faced “substantially lower forecasted cash flow generation . . . high debt levels relative to cash flow and Moody’s expectation of some production declines caused by reduced capital investment”.Standard & Poor’s and Fitch both maintain investment grade ratings on the company’s debt.Anadarko sold new 10-year debt with a yield of roughly 5.59 per cent, or 362.5 basis points above the benchmark Treasury. That marked an improvement from initial price talk of 412.5 basis points above the comparable Treasury on Monday, but remained wide of 10-year paper sold by Anadarko in 2014 that currently yields 5.41 per cent.The company also sold new five- and 30-year bonds in the transaction led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays and Mizuho, according to a person familiar with the matter.One investor who said he had placed an order for the debt characterised Anadarko as a “name everyone likes”.The bond sale should give some confidence to energy groups that face debt maturities between 2016 and 2020. Ahead of the Anadarko sale, only five energy companies had completed bond sales in the US this year, an 85 per cent drop from one year earlier, according to Dealogic data.The last junk-rated energy group to complete a US dollar bond sale was YPF, Argentina’s state-controlled oil company, which sold $100m last December.Fitch warned last week that one-in-five high-yield energy groups that have issued debt in the US will default this year.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

Moody’s, which downgraded Anadarko to junk status last month, warned the company faced “substantially lower forecasted cash flow generation…high debt levels relative to cash flow and Moody’s expectation of some production declines caused by reduced capital investment.”Standard & Poor’s and Fitch both maintain investment grade ratings on the company’s debt.Anadarko is expected to sell new 10-year debt with a yield that is 375 basis points above the benchmark Treasury, or roughly 5.695 per cent. That’s an improvement from initial price talk of 412.5 basis points earlier on Monday, but remained wide of ten-year paper sold by Anadarko in 2014 that currently yields 5.39 per cent.One investor watching the deal characterised Anadarko as a “name everyone likes” and said he would not be surprised if the final size of the transaction is increased.The company is also selling new five- and 30-year bonds.

55;COP;Conocophillips;2016-02-25T19:22:39Z;Oil sector aims for profits at $50 crude;Industry hopes cost-cutting will generate returns with prices set to stay low;Outside the energy industry’s premier conference in Houston this week, a qualified petroleum engineer, immaculately dressed in suit and tie, has been holding up a sign saying: “Please hire me!”He has been a victim of the sector’s worst downturn for three decades, one of the 95,000 people who have lost their jobs in the US oil industry since 2014. The odds are against him. Oil companies are working to put in place lower cost bases that will enable them to survive in a world in which crude prices could remain at about $50 per barrel for many years to come. Two years ago John Watson, chief executive of Chevron, observed that “$100 per barrel is becoming the new $20”. He meant that the cost of finding and extracting oil had risen so much that companies like his needed a markedly higher crude price to achieve the same profitability that had been possible at significantly lower levels a decade earlier. Today, it seems that $50 is the new $100. As Ali al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, warned executives at the IHS CERAWeek conference on Tuesday, producers of higher-cost barrels “must find a way to lower their costs, borrow cash, or liquidate”. Oil is a cyclical business, and there is a general consensus in the industry that current prices of about $34 per barrel for internationally traded Brent crude are unsustainably low. But oil executives are not expecting a rebound to anything close to the prices of $100-plus that seemed barely adequate only two years ago. The US shale oil industry, which helped precipitate the collapse in oil prices with a debt-fuelled production boom, is in dire financial straits. Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, the two largest producers in the Bakken formation of North Dakota, one of the heartlands of that boom, said this week they were stopping bringing any new wells into production in the region. When prices do pick up again, however, industry executives say activity will recover and production can start to rise again. It may take time to come back, depending on investors’ enthusiasm for committing fresh capital, but shale could act as a long-term cap on prices. David Hager, chief executive of Devon Energy, an independent production company, says that at $55 to $60 oil, “the vast majority” of US shale fields are economically viable. Others put the number rather higher. Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, another leading independent, suggests oil would need to be $60 to $70 for US shale production to grow. No one, however, is talking about $90 or $100. Everyone in the industry is going to have to learn to compete at prices influenced by US shale. And given the uncertainties involved — the US shale business is so new, it has still not yet been through one full cycle of growth, downturn and recovery — it makes sense to take a cautious view of how far prices can rebound. As Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, puts it, the upturn will come, “it’s just you can’t bet on it coming quickly . . . You’ve got to be prepared for it taking a little while longer”. At BP, they are preparing for the company to be able to cover its capital spending and its dividend payments from its cash flows with oil at about $50. Last year, BP said it was aiming for that break-even at $60 oil, but Lamar McKay, the newly-promoted deputy chief executive, says executives believe they can “probably do a bit better than that”. Some of BP’s cost reductions come from driving down the prices charged by suppliers, but about a half to two-thirds, says Mr McKay, come from “self-help”: efficiency improvements including job cuts. BP has announced it is losing 7,000 jobs, and Mr McKay says that he expects to go “quite a bit beyond that” by the end of the year.BP’s proposed Mad Dog 2 oil project in the Gulf of Mexico has been redesigned, for example, to make it less expensive, and now the company is haggling with suppliers to make the economics work before it commits to the investment. Other companies are making similar moves. Bespoke engineering, customisation and bureaucratic management structures are being jettisoned, to be replaced by standardised designs and leaner organisations. Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, is aiming to cut the price needed for its US shale oil operations to break even from $90 per barrel in 2014 to $50 in 2018.“It’s a revolution in a company like ours,” says Torgrim Reitan, Statoil’s head of development and production in the US. “To set up the right agility and accountability so that we can move quickly.” Marvin Odum, the head of Royal Dutch Shell’s US business who announced his departure this week, says the company has a similar approach for its North American shale oil and gas operations.“The cost structure is coming down in a very sustainable way,” he adds. “As we get down into the low 50s and now into the 40s in terms of the break-evens . . . in the sweet spots [shale is] a globally competitive resource.” The industry has been here before, not too long ago. In late 2008 and early 2009, oil prices were also in the low $30s, and there was talk about a reset of the oil companies’ cost bases and ways of working. But then oil rapidly rebounded. “I barely remember it,” says Mr McKay. “The fundamental change that’s necessary in the behaviour of vast numbers of people — operators and contractors alike — didn’t have time to take root . . . It sobered everyone up for a moment, and then the party started again.” He thinks those same mistakes may not be made again.“This feels more fundamental,” says Mr McKay. “The surprise of 5m barrels per day of US shale, and the speed with which that was brought on: that’s a fundamental supply and demand issue that’s got to be worked out.”
56;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chesapeake to slash capital spending to conserve cash;Former star of the US shale gas boom reports $14.9bn loss for last year;Chesapeake Energy, the second-largest gas producer in the US, on Wednesday announced a cut of up to 69 per cent in its capital spending for this year, as it seeks to conserve cash amid the commodity price crash.The company set out the plans as it reported a $14.9bn net loss for 2015, compared to a profit of $1.3bn in 2014, following writedowns in the value of its gas and oilfields.Chesapeake was one of the stars of the US shale gas boom of the 2000s, growing rapidly under its founder Aubrey McClendon, who left the company in 2013.Under Doug Lawler, Mr McClendon’s successor as chief executive, Chesapeake has been working to reduce its large debt load and to shift to increased production of crude and other liquids.But the company has been hit hard by the collapse in oil and gas prices. The principal factor behind the loss for 2015 was an $18.2bn pre-tax writedown of Chesapeake’s assets, to reflect those lower prices.The company’s operating cash flow dropped 56 per cent to $2.3bn last year.That cash generation fell short of Chesapeake’s capital spending of $3.2bn in 2015, raising concerns about the sustainability of its finances.Chesapeake’s shares have dropped 86 per cent in the past year.But Chesapeake on Wednesday played down suggestions that it was exploring a possible bankruptcy, saying that it was working on debt exchanges and other moves to reduce its borrowings, and had hired specialist lawyers to advise on that.The results were received positively by the markets, with Chesapeake’s shares rising nearly 23 per cent to $2.69 by the close of trading in New York.However, Jonathan Wolff, analyst at Jefferies, said in a note that Chesapeake’s financial distress was “becoming even more clear and more dire”, and described the company’s cash burn as “alarming”.Chesapeake’s move to cut its capital spending follows other US independent exploration and production companies such as ConocoPhillips, Continental Resources and Devon Energy, which are planning similarly steep reductions in their budgets.The cuts raise the prospect that the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the US, which has already slumped since 2014, will fall further this year.Chesapeake said the slowdown in drilling would lead to its production falling by up to 5 per cent this year, excluding the effect of asset sales.Chesapeake said it had a $4bn borrowing facility of which only $77m had been used. It added it expected that credit line would be renewed at a “really strong” level when it was determined with lenders in April.The company added that it planned to repay bonds that reach maturity next month. It would also continue moves it has been making to buy back its debt, taking advantage of the depressed prices of its bonds.
57;COP;Conocophillips;2016-02-14T18:07:43Z;Oil majors’ business model under increasing pressure;BP, Chevron and Exxon walk a fine line between paying dividends and investing in operations;"Gorgon, a massive liquefied natural gas project off the north-west coast of Australia, is one of the wonders of the modern age. Its $54bn price tag makes it — in nominal terms at least — one of the most expensive engineering projects ever completed.It could also be a monument to a fading era, the last hurrah of Big Oil.With US crude hitting 12-year lows last week, some in the industry are asking whether the business model of large international oil companies such as Chevron, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, the three principal partners in Gorgon, is fundamentally flawed.Due to dispatch its first LNG cargo soon, Gorgon is the type of project that justifies the existence of large oil companies. Chevron, which is leading it, is one of only a handful of businesses that have the technical capabilities and financial strength to take on a challenge of that scale.After the plunge in crude prices, however, such ambitious investments in LNG, deepwater exploration and Canada’s oil sands are becoming increasingly scarce.Morgan Stanley analysts calculate that just nine large projects, out of more than 230 awaiting a green light worldwide, are “realistic candidates” for approval this year. They could include BP’s $10bn Mad Dog 2 deepwater oil project in the Gulf of Mexico, and Italy-based Eni’s offshore Zohr gas discovery in Egypt. Total of France plans to approve no projects at all.Across the industry, some $400bn in expected investment has been cancelled or delayed.When executives from the large oil companies talk about the industry downturn, they generally frame it as a temporary condition. Because crude at below $30 per barrel is much too low to incentivise investment, they say, the oversupply in the oil market will correct, and prices will rebound to levels that will allow them to make respectable returns again.The chief executives of BP and Shell both argued at their companies’ 2015 results this month that the oil market could come back into balance this year. As Bob Dudley of BP put it, his expectations about prices were “lower for longer, not lower forever”.But what if they are wrong? Philip Verleger, an energy economist, argues that “nightfall is coming” for big oil companies, threatened on one side by the rise of renewable energy and climate policies that will curb the growth of fossil fuel demand, and on the other by the smaller, nimbler companies that lead the shale oil and gas industry.“The companies that are wedded to high-cost projects, like deep water in Brazil, are going to have to take some large writedowns,” he says. “The likelihood that those investments are going to pay off over the next 20 years is extremely low.”Companies that put their hopes in a strong rebound in oil “aren’t going to make it”, he adds.While the oil price is likely to rise sooner or later, many industry executives and analysts believe a sustained recovery will prompt a rapid revival in shale drilling in the US, bringing on additional production and in effect putting a ceiling on prices.In this view of the world, the price crash has been like an asteroid strike: agile shale producers can survive, but the lumbering dinosaurs of big oil are doomed.Certainly the pressure on large oil companies is intense at the moment. After Eni cut its dividend last year, followed by ConocoPhillips and other US production companies this year, rising yields on the largest companies’ shares suggests some investors are increasingly concerned over whether their payouts will be maintained.Analysts generally believe they will be able to maintain their dividends. Unlike Conoco, which split off its refining, chemicals and pipelines business as Phillips 66 in 2012, the largest companies have retained significant downstream operations. They act as a natural hedge, usually making higher profits when crude and natural gas prices are weak.Big oil groups also tend to be bureaucratic, with plenty of scope to become slimmer. “They are mature organisations that are delivering multibillion-dollar projects, so there are reasons why they are the way they are,” says Robin West of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “But they need to become more agile, and they need to get their costs down.”Most of the largest oil companies have already announced job cuts. Shell has said it plans to cut about 10,000 jobs, including rationalisation following the impending takeover of BG Group; Chevron cut its headcount by 3,200 last year and plans a further reduction of 4,000 this year, while BP plans to shed about 7,000 staff in 2015-16.The companies have also been reining in capital spending on drilling wells, finding reserves and developing fields, with reductions of between 6 per cent for Shell and 25 per cent for Exxon planned for this year.The effects of those cuts have been mixed, however. Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, downgraded Chevron and Shell this month. It said it did not expect any additional change in Chevron’s rating, but Shell could be downgraded further. It is also considering stripping Exxon of its rare and valued AAA status.Moreover, those ratings are based on S&P’s assumptions of oil at $40 this year, $45 next and $50 from 2018, which is a path well above today’s price. If oil stays below $30, companies would face tough decisions between abandoning their commitments to their dividends and cutting investment even further.Already cuts in capital spending are being reflected in expectations for future output. Total and Chevron have both scaled back their production targets, although they are still growing thanks to the momentum from investment projects already under way.BP is in a trickier position. It has cut closer to the bone, having already disposed of more than $40bn of assets following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. Mr Dudley is reluctant to trim projected investment even further.For shareholders, this pressure on spending might be welcome. Lydia Rainforth, analyst at Barclays, argues the problem for big oil has not been “over-distribution” of earnings to investors but “overspending” on projects.“Perhaps a more rigorous and disciplined approach imposed by the need to pay the dividend could drive better investment choices,” says Ms Rainforth.Phil Gresh of JPMorgan agrees that if big oil companies fail to grow, that is not necessarily bad news for investors, so long as they are returning capital through dividends and share repurchases when the oil price picks up. Buybacks mean production per share can grow, even if total output does not, he adds.For some executives, this role of managing decline might seem insufficiently ambitious. The alternative is to follow Shell’s example and grow by acquisition.Eric Oudenot of the Boston Consulting Group argues that the terrible financial position of the independent companies in the US shale industry, with large debts and almost no wells to drill that are profitable at $30 oil, means that “if we have weak prices for two or three more years, the majority will either fold or be taken over”.That means that the crisis for big oil could also be a time of great opportunity. Many billions of barrels of reserves in the shale fields could be coming on to the market, priced to sell so creditors can collect their cash.“Big oil companies can absorb small and midsized companies’ assets,” says Mr Oudenot. “And then when oil prices recover, if they have managed to reduce their costs, they can be highly profitable.”That might seem an overambitious recommendation for companies that are counting the pennies.Culturally, big oil has often been a bad fit with the shale business. Still, if large oil companies want to survive this potentially extinction-level event, they will need to evolve. Buying up the shale industry might be just the way to do it.When big oil companies try to cut costs, there are generally two ways of doing it: forcing down the rates they are charged by their suppliers; and finding better ways of working. The first way is generally the easiest, but the second is more valuable, because it is more lasting. Suppliers’ prices will rise again as activity in the industry picks up.Total of France last September gave some examples of efficiency gains, saying that improvements such as having operators capable of performing multiple different roles meant that between 2014 and 2017 it could cut the number of people working on its Block 17 oil development in Angola by 30 per cent, and on its mature fields in the UK by 20 per cent.Companies are also looking at new ways of working together. Last week General Electric, the US industrial group that has been building an oil and gas business, announced an innovative deal with Diamond Offshore, a drilling contractor, for the servicing blowout preventers — the stacks of valves used at the top of a well to shut off any leaks.The traditional model is that a manufacturer sells blowout preventers to a drilling contractor, who takes responsibility for servicing and maintaining them, calling in the company that made them as needed. In this deal, GE bought the equipment from four of Diamond’s drillships — giving the company $210m in no doubt welcome cash — and agreed a ten year deal to service them.The contract gives GE rewards for availability, paying out more if the blowout preventers are well-maintained and passing inspections. As a result, says Chuck Chauviere, GE’s president of drilling systems, its incentives are completely aligned with those of its customers.Before, the manufacturer might have been looking for some nice lucrative maintenance work when something went wrong. Now, everyone wants the blowout preventers to be ready for use as much as possible. The model is “when you get results, we get paid”, said Mr Chauviere. “That completely changes the culture”.Robin West of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that oil producers and service companies need to be coming up with many similarly creative ideas.“Relationships between production companies and service companies have been very adversarial,” he says.“The service companies and the oil producers have not fully recognised the depth of their codependency. They need to find solutions together.”"
58;COP;Conocophillips;2016-02-12T14:44:47Z;IP Week parties divide oil sector’s winners and losers ;Few are forecasting a quick return to higher prices;If you can check the pulse of an industry by the way it parties, then the winners and losers were easy to spot at London’s International Petroleum Week.The annual round of receptions that dominate one of the best attended events of the oil market calendar showed just who has made — and lost — money from the biggest price rout in a generation.Those oil-producing nations that had grown used to throwing champagne-soaked jamborees during the era of $100 oil were notably restrained, with lager and warm white wine reflecting the new reality of savage budget cuts. Some had cancelled their parties entirely, including the state oil companies of Opec members Algeria and Angola.“The parties, the ones that were not cancelled, were very much toned down this year,” said the London head of one oil trading company. Crude oil has dropped more than 70 per cent since the middle of 2014 to near $30 a barrel, shredding the budgets of oil-producing countries and forcing energy companies to reassess hundreds of billions of dollars in future spending plans. While most were keen to keep up appearances this week and treat their clients, signs of the strain were on show.Socar, Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil company, went ahead with its annual bash hosted in the ballroom of the Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane, but it lacked its usual sparkle. Gone was the lavish decor, expensive lighting and musical entertainment that had once made the well-attended party one of the highlights of IP Week.During a decade of high oil prices, Azerbaijan’s GDP grew tenfold to more than $73bn, according to the World Bank, helping to drag the former Soviet republic of 9m people out of poverty. Now, officials from the International Monetary Fund are heading to its capital to discuss possible emergency loan packages. Even among those who had profited from the downturn, few were forecasting a quick return to higher prices, with the market turmoil at the start of 2016 provoking fears that a supply-driven crisis is only getting worse. Chris Bake, an executive at Vitol, the world’s biggest oil trader, told the Financial Times the oil market could no longer rely on low prices to to drive “incremental demand”. He predicted the market may not balance until well into 2017.A poll at a Platts event at the start of the week asked hundreds of oil market professionals what the price will be at the end of the year — 90 per cent of them said $55 a barrel or below, even as many believe $30 oil will decimate investment across the industry.“Our sense of IP Week sentiment among the trading fraternity is that oil prices will rebound from current levels,” said David Hufton, chief executive of PVM, a London-based oil brokerage. “But there is disagreement as to whether they will take another substantial dip first and whether a serious rebound will occur in the second half of this year or will have to wait until the second half of 2017.”The market is no further forward than it was last year when it was wondering what it would take to make prices rebound, said one executive from a west African oil-producing country. “You can only hope for a very small rise in prices. You’re not going to see anything spectacular.”Gallows humour ran through the week’s dinners, seminars and receptions. Speaking to a filled banqueting hall at the annual IP Week dinner, Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, told the audience: “Things look their darkest . . . just before they really turn pitch black.” There was muffled laughter in the room. You can only hope for a very small rise in prices. You’re not going to see anything spectacularBob Dudley, chief executive of BP, told the IP Week conference that by the second half of this year “every storage tank and swimming pool in the world will be full of oil”. Not everybody was drowning their sorrows, of course. At the parties thrown by some of the world’s biggest trading houses, refiners and tank owners, spirits were high, having taken advantage of cheap oil and lucrative opportunities to engage in profitable storage trades. At a Mayfair pub, Swedish company Scandinavian Tank Storage had dubbed their IP week event the “Winners Party”. Girls in gold-glittered hats circled with selfie-sticks for the few who wanted to commemorate the year.Some of the most powerful national oil companies — such as Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and Saudi Aramco — also wanted to demonstrate they have the firepower to ride out the downturn.The upscale Kuwaiti event at the Four Seasons offered guests lavish spreads of seafood, lamb and sumptuous desserts. At The Dorchester, sushi platters and champagne were on hand for the Saudi party. The conversations were far from positive, however, despite the surroundings.“We don’t know whether the price has bottomed,” said one KPC executive, who added that everyone in the industry was worried about the slowdown in China’s economy — the engine of demand growth for the last decade.Few were convinced attempts to get Opec producers to work with countries like Russia to agree production cutbacks would work. After saying a co-ordinated 1m-barrels-a-day production cut would help prices recover, Rosneft head Igor Sechin told the FT: “Who are we supposed to be talking to about cuts? Will Saudi Arabia or Iran cut production?”Indeed, many only saw signs the battle for customers was only intensifying among the world’s largest producers.As they snacked on local dishes at a Mayfair pub, refiners from eastern Europe reflected on their popularity over pints of beer.“We are being courted by everyone from the Saudis to Russians,” said one refining executive with a broad grin.“There’s oil everywhere and we’re spoiled for choice.”

For the current quarter, Ralph Lauren expected flat net revenues, down 2 per cent from the period a year ago.Third-quarter profits were $131m, or $1.54 a share, compared with $215m, or $2.41 a share, in the period the previous year. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $2.12 a share. Adjusting for one-off items, earnings of $2.27 a share topped expectations.Ralph Lauren faces increased competition from fast-fashion retailers such as Zara and H&M and the proliferation of ecommerce. The strong dollar has hurt the chain by eroding tourism spending in the US and denting overseas earnings.Sales slid 4 per cent to $1.9bn, shy of estimates for $2bn. Warm weather, declining tourist traffic and product assortment challenges contributed to a 4 per cent decline in North America sales.Stefan Larsson, chief executive, said: “We are disappointed with the current business results.”He succeeded Ralph Lauren last year in an effort to revive sales, having helped turn round sales at Gap’s Old Navy brand.The shares declined 40 per cent last year.Kohl’s was also under pressure, falling 18.8 per cent to $41.52 after it cut its full-year earnings forecast. The department store expects fiscal 2015 earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4 a share, down from its previous outlook for the low end of $4.40 to $4.60.Shares in GoPro fell as much as 16 per cent to $9.01, a fresh record low, after it revealed a disappointing outlook and said that it was abandoning the low end of the action-camera market.The maker of wearable cameras expects revenues in the range of $160m to $180m in the current quarter, below the $300m expected by analysts. Its full-year sales forecast of $1.35bn-$1.5bn also came in shy of Wall Street estimates.Disappointing fourth-quarter results showed the company swinging to a loss of $34.5m in the final three months of the year.Analysts at Sterne Agee downgraded GoPro from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered their price target from $21 to $10.Shares in ConocoPhillips declined 8.7 per cent to $35.29 after the oil company cut its dividend by nearly 70 per cent to 25 cents a share amid a protracted slump in crude prices.The S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to 1,915.45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 16,416.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 4,509.56.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
60;COP;Conocophillips;2016-02-04T13:55:50Z;ConocoPhillips cuts dividend amid falling oil price;Company falls to loss in fourth quarter and becomes first large US producer to reduce its payout;"ConocoPhillips has become the first large US oil production company to cut its dividend in response to the decline in oil prices, announcing a 66 per cent reduction as it attempts to shore up its finances.The move is a sharp reversal for Conoco, which in December said its dividend was “the highest priority use of our cash”.Ryan Lance, chief executive, said: “While we don’t know how far commodity prices will fall, or the duration of the downturn, we believe it’s prudent to plan for lower prices for a longer period of time.”The announcement came as Statoil of Norway said it remained committed to its dividend, after it reported a full-year loss of NKr37.3bn ($4.4bn) and introduced a plan to conserve cash by making the payouts in new shares.Royal Dutch Shell reported a 44 per cent drop in underlying earnings excluding one-off items to $1.8bn for the fourth quarter, but predicted a rebound in oil prices.Conoco’s dividend cut was accompanied by a reduction in its planned capital spending for this year by 17 per cent from the budget it set out at the end of 2015. It reported a $3.5bn net loss for the fourth quarter of last year; a worse result than analysts had expected.That loss included charges for writedowns in the value of assets, including a liquefied natural gas project in Australia, fields in the North Sea and abandoned exploration prospects in the Arctic, Angola and the US Gulf of Mexico.Even excluding those charges, Conoco reported a $1.1bn fourth quarter loss, compared with a $742m profit for the equivalent period of 2014.By early afternoon in New York, Conoco’s shares had fallen about 7 per cent to $36 as investors responded to the cut.The reduction is the first for Conoco since it was spun off from DuPont in 1998. Mr Lance said the decision had been “difficult” and the payout remained “a top priority”.However, he said, the company needed to cut costs to restore profitability and to “substantially” reduce its borrowings. Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, said on Tuesday that it had put Conoco’s A rating on watch for a possible downgrade and would make a decision within 90 days, based on factors including its ability to cut capital spending without damaging production.Net debt rose by $5bn during 2015 to $22.5bn, as cash from operations of $7.6bn fell short of capital spending of $10.1bn and dividend payments of $3.7bn.This year, the company now plans capital spending of $6.4bn, compared with its previous $7.7bn plan announced in December.At the time, Conoco said it expected oil and gas production growth of 1 to 3 per cent this year. It now expects output to be unchanged from last year.Conoco became the world’s largest company focused solely on exploration and production for oil and gas when it spun off its refining, pipelines and chemicals businesses in 2012 as Phillips 66.That has left it more exposed to fluctuations in commodity markets compared with its larger US rivals ExxonMobil and Chevron, which have had support for their cash flows during the downturn from strong performances by their refining operations. At the time of the spin-off in 2012, Conoco told investors it could offer both a higher dividend than other exploration and production companies and output growth, but the collapse in oil and gas prices has now made that impossible.Its quarterly dividend has now been reduced from 74 cents to 25 cents a share. Other large oil companies have so far been maintaining their dividend payments, although Eni of Italy announced a cut last March.Noble Energy, a US exploration and production company that is about one-third the size of Conoco, announced a dividend cut last month."
61;COP;Conocophillips;2016-02-04T12:09:13Z;Oil major ConocoPhillips takes axe to dividend;;ConocoPhillips has become the first major US oil company to take the axe to its dividend, as it looks to conserve cash in face of the relentless rout in global crude prices.The company on Thursday cut its quarterly dividend by two thirds – from 74 cents a share to 25 cents – while announcing a further squeeze in its capital expenditure plans for 2016. It now expects to spend $6.4bn, down from a planned $7.7bn.ConocoPhillips shares tumbled 4.3 per cent on the news in pre-market trading.Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive officer, said:While we don’t know how far commodity prices will fall, or the duration of the downturn, we believe it’s prudent to plan for lower prices for a longer period of time. The actions we have announced will improve net cash flow by $4.4 billion in 2016.The decision to reduce the dividend was a difficult one. The dividend has been, and will continue to be, a top priority. We still intend to provide a competitive dividend, while significantly lowering the breakeven price for the company and substantially reducing the level of borrowing in 2016. Our actions also position us to deliver strong absolute and relative performance as prices recover.Shares in the big US oil companies have come under pressure in the run-up to the fourth quarter earnings season amid fears that they would cut their dividends.And while smaller energy companies – such as Kinder Morgan – has cut payout, Big Oil has largely resisted such a move, preferring instead to cut investments, jobs, sell assets or borrow to cover dividend paymentsJust this week Exxon Mobil and BP have both vowed to protect their payout policy despite oil prices having falling more than 70 per cent from their mid-2014 highs.The dividend move by ConocoPhillips comes as the company reported a net loss of $3.45bn for the last three months of last year. The loss included $2.7bn charge for asset writedowns.Sales tumbled 42 per cent to $11.8bn for the quarter.Having said just three months ago that it expects production to grow in 2016 through a ramp up of oil sands production in Canada and startup projects in Alaska, ConocoPhillips said on Thursday that it now expects production to be “essentially flat” this year.Earlier this week, Standard & Poor’s ConocoPhillips on watch for a possible downgrade within 90 days. S&P said this would depend on the company’s ability to achieve cost savings and asset sales, and to cut capital spending without hurting production rates.
62;COP;Conocophillips;2016-02-03T00:58:53Z;Standard & Poor’s cuts ratings of US oil and gas groups;Chevron hit and shale producers are downgraded to junk;Standard & Poor’s has cut the credit ratings of some leading US oil and gas companies, including Chevron, the country’s second largest, as a result of the agency’s lowered expectations for long-term crude prices.The decisions show how the plunge in oil and gas since the summer of 2014 is hitting not only the highly indebted exploration and production companies that borrowed to finance their growth during the US shale boom, but also the more financially conservative independent companies and even the large international oil groups Chevron and ExxonMobil. Three leading shale oil and gas producers, Continental Resources, Southwestern Energy and privately held Hunt Oil, were downgraded from investment grade to “junk” status. Exxon, the largest US oil group and one of only three companies in the country with an AAA status, was put on watch for a possible downgrade of the rating. S&P said it would decide on Exxon within 90 days.The moves follow the agency’s announcement last month that it would be using lowered long-term oil and gas price expectations to calculate ratings. Its new projection is that both international benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate crude will average $40 this year, $45 next year and $50 from 2018 onwards. In December 2014, S&P was using a long-term Brent price assumption of $85. The agency said on Tuesday that the scale of the reduction in its price expectations meant that even investment grade companies were affected. It added that it expected many of those companies to continue to cut capital spending and raise their productivity, but “these actions, for the most part, are insufficient to stem the meaningful deterioration expected in credit measures over the next few years”. The agency said it would assess Exxon’s “financial policies and strategies for mitigating the potential impact of the downturn”, as well as look at its 2015 results. Exxon reported a 50 per cent drop in earnings for 2015, a smaller decline than for rivals Chevron and BP, and is cutting capital spending sharply, but its net debt rose by $10.6bn during the year to $35bn as it borrowed to pay its dividend. Ratings for Chevron as well as EOG Resources, Apache and Devon Energy, three large independent oil and gas producers, were cut but remained investment grade. Ratings for Hess, Marathon Oil and Murphy Oil, three other leading independent US exploration and production companies, were cut to BBB-, also still investment grade but just one notch above junk. ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, was also put on watch for a possible downgrade within 90 days. S&P said this would depend on the company’s ability to achieve cost savings and asset sales, and to cut capital spending without hurting production rates. There was good news for four others, however: Occidental Petroleum, EQT, Cimarex Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources were affirmed at investment grade ratings. The moves follow S&P’s announcement on Monday that it had cut Royal Dutch Shell’s rating by one notch to A+ from AA-, and put a negative outlook on other large European oil companies including BP, Statoil and Total.Yields on investment grade energy bonds, which move inversely to their price, have climbed rapidly as oil tumbled over the past year, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The yield on the US bank’s energy index had risen to 5.36 per cent on Tuesday, more than 1.9 percentage points above its low last April. The spread of the yield on the energy index above US government bonds has widened to its highest level since the country started to emerge from recession in 2009.
63;COP;Conocophillips;2016-02-02T20:11:32Z;ExxonMobil under pressure from oil slump;Like BP, US energy group needs to lay foundations for growth;"ExxonMobil has a rich history, tracing its roots back to John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, and its executives like to take the long view.True to that stance, Rex Tillerson, chief executive, adopted a stoical tone on the vagaries of commodity markets when the US company released quarterly results on Tuesday. Exxon’s range of businesses and financial strength gave it “confidence to invest through the cycle to create long-term shareholder value”, he said.But for all Mr Tillerson’s sangfroid, the slump in oil prices is affecting Exxon, even if not to the same degree as many of its rivals.The 71 per cent plunge in Brent crude prices since the summer of 2014 to about $33 per barrel on Tuesday has prompted steep cuts in Exxon’s capital spending, and that will have implications for the future of the company, and for the wider industry. Although Exxon’s performance on the surface looked much better than BP’s quarterly results, the two companies are facing the same fundamental challenge: how to lay the foundations for future growth in profits amid the harsh industry downturn. Exxon’s earnings last year were more resilient than other oil companies’. A 185 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits from its refining division, which benefits from cheaper crude, helped offset the 86 per cent plunge in earnings from oil and gas production. The company also avoided the large writedowns in asset values that afflicted both BP and Chevron’s fourth-quarter results last week, and delivered relatively healthy figures from oil and gas production in the US. Exxon’s $1.1bn loss from US upstream operations for 2015 compared favourably to Chevron’s $4.1bn. Although Exxon’s cash flows were not enough to cover its dividends, which were paid for by borrowings, the $10.6bn increase in Exxon’s net debt during the year looks affordable.Exxon is one of only three US companies with a triple-A credit rating. However, evidence is now emerging of the pressure facing the oil group.S&P said on Tuesday that it was putting Exxon’s long term rating on watch for a potential downgrade at the same time as it cut the ratings for some other companies because of lowered expectations of future crude prices.The agency said it expected to reach a decision on whether to cut Exxon’s rating within 90 days.In another sign of the financial constraints facing Exxon, its share buybacks to reduce the number outstanding, which continued throughout last year, have been put on hold for the time being. The clearest sign, however, is the planned 25 per cent reduction in Exxon’s capital and exploration spending for this year, to $23.2bn. A measure of the caution implied by that stance is that Exxon again expects to have lower capital and exploration spending than Chevron in 2016, as it did last year, even though its market capitalisation is roughly double its rival’s. The scale of that reduction raises questions about whether Exxon is investing enough to deliver any production growth in the future. Cost deflation in the industry means the company will be able to do more with every dollar it spends. There is, for example, oversupply in the market for offshore drilling rigs. Transocean, one of the leading offshore drilling contractors, reported in October that a rig it had previously contracted to Exxon for $670,000 per day was last month being used for just $395,000 per day. ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, in December reported cost declines of up to 38 per cent for oilfield services drilling and completing wells onshore in the US. Even so, the curb on spending by Exxon means it is likely to bring on new production less quickly. It has been struggling with growth for a very long time. Average oil and gas production increased by 3 per cent last year to 4.1m barrels of oil equivalent per day, but that is lower than its level soon after Exxon bought Mobil back in 1999. BP faces similar issues. Bob Dudley, chief executive, made it clear on Tuesday he was not about to tear up plans, set out only three months ago, to withstand a prolonged period of lower prices.BP, which budgeted for a Brent crude price of $50 per barrel last year, has planned for $30 to $40 during the first three months of this year and assumes an average of under $50 for 2016 as a whole, according to Brian Gilvary, finance director. That meant no cuts to projected capital spending, with the UK company guiding towards the lower end of its forecast of $17bn to $19bn for 2016: “We haven’t cut into the bone yet,” said Mr Dudley. Cost deflation could put BP in a position to approve the now long-awaited Mad Dog 2 oil project in the Gulf of Mexico. Such projects, said analysts, will be essential if BP, which has shrunk drastically since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, is to meet targeted production growth. It plans to add 800,000 barrels a day within five years, to avoid losing its status as one of the world’s “super-majors”. The other answer to the lack of growth would be to expand through acquisition. That is an option available to both companies, although Exxon, with its much greater resources, can afford to dream bigger. BP and Exxon held back from acquisitions last year; wisely, as it turned out, because valuations have continued to tumble. The longer the financial squeeze on the industry lasts, the more compelling the case for rationalisation will become.BP’s muscular trading division, which buys and sells more barrels of oil than almost any company on earth, helped offset a poor performance at the UK energy group’s exploration and production business in 2015.Brian Gilvary, BP’s finance director, said the company’s oil traders had enjoyed “a very good year” with “one of the highest results we have seen for some time”. While BP no longer discloses how much profit it secures from trading, making it difficult to determine just how much of the group’s record $7.5bn of downstream earnings last year came from this activity, there were some clues. Oil traders have been some of the few in the energy industry to benefit from the collapse in crude prices.Those with the capital and access to storage bought up millions of cheap excess barrels of oil in 2015, locking in a small profit on each by selling them forward in the futures market, where prices are higher for delivery later in the year. The first half of 2015 was particularly profitable for BP’s traders, said company insiders, although something appears to have changed in the fourth quarter.Mr Gilvary admitted that oil trading had made a small loss in the final three months of 2015, and the company declined to elaborate on the reasons for this. Traders in the industry said the need to shore up their parent companies’ results in a world of $30 oil is adding to pressures, with little leeway for mistakes.BP insiders remained optimistic about the outlook for oil trading. Low financing costs, high volatility, and the ability to profitably store excess crude all play to the trading division’s strengths. The last time BP revealed how its oil traders fared was in 2005, the year when Mr Gilvary took charge of the division. Then, trading generated almost $3bn of earnings."
64;COP;Conocophillips;2016-01-04T17:02:51Z;Cairn Energy: making up;The UK oil explorer has decided that less is more. Investors like the new focus;"Keep it simple, stupid. Those words, coined by an engineer half a century ago, apply to the strategies of listed companies, too. We all prefer clean and simple stories, especially in unpopular sectors and wobbly markets. Push too many ideas and one risks stretching the already limited attention span of investors to breaking point.The KISS principle is working for Cairn Energy, the UK-listed oil explorer. It plans to drill oil wells off the coast of Senegal; it has the cash to do so. Simple. Having found some evidence of oil in the area last year, on Monday the explorer reported another drilling success. Cairn’s shares rallied as much as 4 per cent even as the FTSE and other markets fell hard.Recent success in Senegal follows some lean years. Cairn had struggled to match, or even approach, the success of its big oil discovery in India more than a decade ago. And things got complicated. Cairn at one point had exploration under way in Morocco, Greenland and Senegal, in addition to its Indian project.After some unsuccessful wells, some of which were very expensive — its wells in Greenland cost well over $100m each — Cairn decided that less was more. Last year, it sold assets and reduced its workforce to focus on Senegal.The oil explorer has a plan for at least two more wells this year. Add to this clarity the fact that in Senegal Cairn has a big US partner in Conoco — something it lacked in Morocco and Greenland — plus enough cash on hand to pay for the drilling, and this story is very plain indeed. Cairn’s shares have done very well, too, considering the malaise in the oil sector. Since July they have outperformed not only the MSCI World Energy index but the FTSE All-Share index as well.India could yet add a complication, though. Following Cairn’s 2006 reorganisation of its Indian subsidiary before its Mumbai IPO, the government demanded a tax payment. That potential liability of $1.6bn (£1bn) is worth up to 46p a share to Cairn Energy if its residual 10 per cent stake in Cairn India is confiscated. Cairn Energy trades at about £1.60. Something to think about.Clearly, the market prefers not to. If all goes well in Senegal, the oil would be worth multiples of this liability. Cairn has a history of returning sale profits to shareholders. The market has chosen to focus on the immediate, and hope for the best later. It is that simple.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.comThis article has been amended to reflect the potential tax liability rests with Cairn India."
65;COP;Conocophillips;2015-12-28T18:32:05Z;Oil companies brace for a grim 2016 amid sustained price crash;Majors including Shell plan more cost-cuts;"As a miserable year for the oil industry draws to a close, any relief executives might feel will be tempered by the knowledge that 2016 is shaping up to be even worse.The collapse in oil and gas prices that began in the summer of last year has already cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, and caused projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars to be cancelled or delayed. Today, the external environment is more challenging than it was a year ago, and the energy companies’ ability to cope with tough conditions is diminished.BP is cutting 4,000 jobs across its exploration and production business, in a further round of cost cutting as oil companies continue to feel the pain of a plunging oil price. Matthew Vincent asks Chris Adams, FT energy editor, how the industry is standing up to the tough market conditions.For oil and gas producers, 2016 will be a year of cost-cutting, restructuring, refinancing when it is possible, and in some cases bankruptcy when it is not. Merger and acquisition activity, which was sluggish this year because of disagreements over valuations, may pick up speed.Oil and gas producers that have other sources of revenues such as refining and chemicals operations, and that still have access to capital markets, will find life difficult but should be able to survive. Companies that are exclusively focused on production and have weak balance sheets will have done well if they can make it through the year.The outlook was already dire a year ago. Since then, Brent crude has fallen a further 39 per cent, to about $37 per barrel on Monday, and is trading at close to an 11-year low. Longer-dated oil futures prices have also dropped sharply, making it less attractive for producers to use derivatives to protect their revenues, and raising expectations that crude will stay “lower for longer”. Prices for natural gas, which are linked to oil under contracts used in Europe and Asia, have been falling too. In the US, the warm winter weather has helped drive benchmark Henry Hub gas to a 16-year low.Many of the levers available for responding to weak prices have already been pulled, according to Andy Brogan of Ernst & Young, the accounting firm. “Companies had oil price hedges in place, they had costs they could cut relatively quickly, they had capital expenditures that they could put on the backburner,” he says. “A lot of these things are going away.”Oil producers have cut costs through efficiency gains and by driving down the rates they have been charged by their suppliers, the oilfield services companies. ConocoPhillips, the world’s largest independent oil and gas producer by market capitalisation, said earlier this month that the cost of land rigs for drilling wells in the US had dropped by 32 per cent over the past year, while the cost of hydraulic fracturing to bring those wells into production had fallen by 38 per cent.US shale oil producers have also continued the steady improvements in productivity they have achieved in recent years. EOG Resources, for example, said last month it had cut the average time to drill a well in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas from 8.9 days last year to 7.7 days.Companies have also been cutting capital spending. BP of the UK said in October it proposed to spend about $19bn this year, down from an original plan of $24bn to $26bn.Such cuts have helped stabilise the industry’s finances. The leading listed oil companies will on average need a Brent crude price of $66 per barrel next year to cover their capital spending, interest payments and dividends from their cash flows, down from $81 this year, according to Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy. Before the cost and spending cuts, they would have needed $104 per barrel to achieve that cash break-even.The break-even level of $66 per barrel, however, still means that at today’s oil prices the industry’s borrowings are set to rise. The large international oil companies can accept higher debts, but do not want their borrowings to run out of control, and they have started to announce a new round of cost reductions. Royal Dutch Shell, which is trying to win shareholder approval for its proposed takeover of BG Group, said this month it planned a further 2,800 job cuts, about 3 per cent of the combined group’s workforce, once the deal goes through.Falling rates for oilfield services will continue to deliver lower costs for producers as contracts come up for renegotiation. For example, Transocean’s Deepwater Champion rig is under contract to ExxonMobil to work in the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of $395,000 per day from November to January, down 41 per cent compared to its previous day rate.How the energy landscape could be reconfigured by the dramatic slump in crude prices

Further readingThere are, however, limits on how far this cost deflation can go. Charges for oilfield services have to be high enough for providers to stay in business. Dave Lesar, chief executive of Halliburton, argues that rates in the US are already at unsustainably low levels. Companies have been raising productivity, for example by drilling in only the best areas, but there are signs that in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken of North Dakota, two of the three largest shale oil regions of the US, productivity gains are levelling off.Nor can companies continue to cut capital spending indefinitely without damaging their revenues. This year companies have typically been focusing on projects that have quick paybacks in production, while slamming the brakes on exploration and longer-term developments, but the natural decline of oilfields means that continued investment is needed to stop output falling.The prospect of tighter supply in the future is laying the foundations for a recovery in oil prices, and companies that have cut costs will be well-placed to benefit. “If oil goes back to $60, things might start to look a lot better,” says Tom Ellacott of Wood Mackenzie. “The sector should have reset at a lower cost base.”The one ray of hope in the oil industry’s Pandora’s Box of troubles is that the greater the cuts in exploration and development spending now, the stronger the eventual upturn is likely to be. The task facing oil companies will be to stay in business for long enough to enjoy that rebound when it comes.For small and midsized companies that use derivatives to hedge their revenues against commodity price risk, one of the mounting pressures in 2016 will be the exhaustion of positions put in place when oil and gas futures were higher than they are today.In the face of unattractive futures prices, for deliveries for years to come, companies have been hedging less. This year, 52 per cent of the leading US independent companies’ oil production was hedged, but only 39 per cent of 2016’s expected output was covered at the end of September, according to Energy Aspects, a consultancy.The hedges that are in place are typically at lower prices, too. The average floor price is $64.80 for 2016, compared to $74.80 for 2015, says Energy Aspects. Pioneer Natural Resources, which is one of the most hedged US companies for next year, has covered 85 per cent of its expected production for 2016, but at a price of $59 per barrel, compared to $71 per barrel for this year, adds the consultancy.The progressive weakening of hedging positions is one factor stoking investors’ anxieties about smaller oil and gas companies, and the more highly leveraged ones in particular. The energy sector of the Bloomberg US high-yield bond index has dropped 20 per cent this year.“A lot of companies [refinanced] this year, and their hope was ‘This will let us fight another day’,” says Steve Wood, managing director of the oil and gas team at Moody’s, the credit rating agency. “Now the other day has come, or is coming. And they are going to run out of money.”Fitch, another rating agency, has predicted that default rates for high-yield energy companies will hit 11 per cent next year, exceeding the most recent peak of 9.8 per cent in 2009, after oil prices plunged during the financial crisis."
66;COP;Conocophillips;2015-12-22T17:49:59Z;Conoco quits Russia after 25 years;Third-largest US oil producer completes withdrawal with sale of stake in venture with Rosneft;"ConocoPhillips, one of the pioneers of foreign investment in the Russian oil and gas industry, has completed a full retreat from the country by selling out of its Polar Lights joint venture with Rosneft.Conoco’s decision to leave Russia after more than 25 years highlights the challenges facing foreign investors in the country’s energy sector, which has been hit by political tensions and the tumble in oil prices.Western oil majors have been attempting to gain access to Russia’s enormous oil reserves since the break-up of the Soviet Union, but have often found themselves stymied by local oligarchs and domestic politics.“There haven’t been that many western oil companies that have managed to make money in Russia,” says Thane Gustafson, author of “Wheel of Fortune”, a history of the Russian oil industry, pointing to BP, ExxonMobil and Schlumberger as three exceptions.The US oil and gas producer confirmed it had sold its 50 per cent stake in Polar Lights, which is focused on the far north-west of Russia. Rosneft, the Russian state oil company, also sold its stake in the asset last week, in a deal that valued the business at about $150m-$200m, said one person familiar with the matter.Conoco’s withdrawal was the result of a string of disappointing investments as well as the growing pull of investment in the shale oil boom at home in the US, analysts say. Following the demerger of its downstream refining, marketing and chemicals businesses in 2012, Conoco has turned its focus to developed countries and North America in particular.“None of their investments in Russia ever worked out very well,” said Matthew Sagers, senior director of Russia & Caspian Energy at IHS.Most recently, western groups struck a series of deals with Russian companies hoping to help develop potentially vast but technically challenging resources in the Arctic and in shale rock. But those projects have largely been frozen amid a combination of western sanctions and falling oil prices, while president Vladimir Putin’s “pivot to Asia” has seen Chinese and Indian groups start to gain equity stakes in Russian energy projects.A few western groups are pushing on with new investments in Russia, such as BP, which in June agreed to pay $750m for a stake in a Rosneft project. Others, such as ExxonMobil, which through a series of joint ventures with Rosneft has access to some of Russia’s most coveted exploration licences, appear to be waiting for political conditions to change. Mr Sagers sums up the attitude of many western groups as: “Don’t bet the company, don’t take a big risk, but don’t take your finger out of Russia.”He added: “In the past, the view was that hydrocarbons were scarce, Russia has a lot of them — we have to be there. Now, it’s very different. There are hydrocarbons in a lot of places, including Williston, North Dakota, so you don’t have to go off to these exotic places any more.”Conoco, before its merger with Phillips, was one of the earliest western oil groups to invest in Russia, having started negotiations before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Its Polar Lights joint venture, registered in 1992, made it the largest foreign investor in the Russian energy sector in the early 1990s.“Conoco was really one of the first,” recalled Mr Gustafson.After a few years, however, Polar Lights became ensnared in domestic Russian politics, and its tax bill increased sharply. “Conoco’s proposition was very much based on its relationship with the regional government,” Mr Gustafson said. “The problem was, the regions lost power relative to the centre; you could no longer run an operation on the basis of your local connections.”In 2004, Conoco increased its commitment to Russia, taking an 8 per cent stake in Lukoil, one of the country’s largest oil producers, which it later raised to 20 per cent.However, the investment failed to give Conoco the access to Russia’s vast oil and gas reserves it had hoped for, and by 2011 it had sold off its stake. It also undertook a broader retreat from the region, selling a 30 per cent stake in a joint venture with Lukoil in 2012 and its stake in Kazakhstan’s Kashagan field in 2013.“Russia was a region where they said look, it’s not working; let’s get out,” said one person familiar with Conoco’s thinking. “It turned out to be a great decision.”Conoco first announced it would seek a buyer for its stake in Polar Lights last year. A person familiar with the deal said the joint venture had been sold to a company owned by the Khotin family. Originally, the Khotins, led by father and son, made money from real estate development in Moscow. In recent years, though, they have started to invest in oil, through the acquisition of a small company in the Irkutsk region and a 29.9 per cent stake in London-listed Exillon Energy.Conoco said: “We sold our 50 per cent interest to Trisonnery Asset Limited. We no longer have operations in Russia.” Rosneft declined to comment on the identity of the buyer, and the Khotin family could not be reached for comment."
67;COP;Conocophillips;2015-12-14T13:23:53Z;Colombia’s Ecopetrol slashes 2016 capex by 40%;;Ecopetrol, Colombia’s state-run oil major, has become the latest energy company to substantially slash its capital expenditure for next year as the plunge in crude shows no signs of abating.The company said it planned to invest $4.8bn next year, a 40 per cent drop from this year’s expected capital spending.In a regulatory filing on Monday, the Colombian company said:The plan focuses on achieving greater efficiencies and profitability in all of the Ecopetrol Group’s areas, with an emphasis on capital discipline, cost reduction and efficiency.Colombia is the region’s fourth-largest oil producer behind Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela, and Ecopetrol produces most of the country’s total output. The Colombian government is Ecopetrol’s controlling shareholder, owning 88.2 per cent of its total capital.While Ecopetrol’s market capitalisation at one time reached $129bn, surpassing that of the embattled Brazil’s Petrobras – which produces three times more oil – shares in the Colombian company have plummeted in tandem with crude prices, dragging the stock’s market value to just $13.5bn.Sentiment towards crude has turned increasingly bearish after a fraught Opec meeting at the start of the month when the cartel failed to reach an agreement on cutting production to prop up prices.Brent crude is now within a hair of its 2008 intraday low of $36.20 a barrel on Monday after falling another 3.8 per cent.The news from Ecopetrol comes after US oil majors Chevron and ConocoPhillips both unveiled large capex cuts last week.
68;COP;Conocophillips;2015-12-10T19:21:51Z;ConocoPhillips cuts spending to half of 2014 level;Reduced capital budget is latest sign of how weak oil and gas prices are weighing on investment;ConocoPhillips, one of the largest oil and gas producers in the US, has announced another sharp cut to its capital spending as it seeks to protect its dividend, pointing to weaker output in the future.The group has set a capital budget for 2016 of $7.7bn, down 25 per cent from this year and less than half the amount it spent in 2014.Its move is the latest sign of how weak oil and gas prices are forcing companies to cut investment, reducing future crude supplies and contributing to bringing the oversupplied market back into balance.Conoco’s move echoes the announcement from Chevron, the second-largest US oil group by market capitalisation, which said on Wednesday that it would cut capital spending by 24 per cent next year.Conoco said on Thursday that it expected oil and gas production growth of 1-3 per cent next year and did not give any projections for output beyond that, saying it would depend on what happened to prices.In the spring of 2014, before oil and gas prices slumped, it was projecting production growth of 3-5 per cent per year.Ryan Lance, chief executive, told analysts on a call: “Despite the tough market, our dividend remains the highest priority use of our cash.”He added: “We view the dividend level as a long-term decision and we’ve been in the current low price cycle for a relatively short period of time.”Mr Lance said that the company had the flexibility to ramp up spending again should prices improve, although it would be “disciplined” in increasing investment in the event of an upturn, and would also strengthen its balance sheet.The US operations outside Alaska, which include shale oil and gas, will take some of the biggest reductions in capital spending, Conoco said.In part that reflects falling costs — rates for onshore rigs used to drill shale wells have fallen by 32 per cent, for example — but Conoco has also been scaling back its activity.Oil prices fell again this week to their lowest in almost seven years, with the benchmark Brent Crude dropping below $40 a barrel. What factors will continue to drive prices in the next 12 months?It is planning to run 13 rigs in the US outside Alaska next year, the same as it has at the moment, but less than half the 32 rigs it was using at the end of 2014.Output from its shale oil and gas operations in the US is expected to show “modest” decline in the medium term, the company said.Chevron also this week announced capital spending cuts, after John Watson, its chief executive, said that dividend payments were its “top priority”.That approach contrasts with other energy companies, including Kinder Morgan, the largest pipelines operator in North America, and Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, which have cut their dividends this year.There has been speculation that Royal Dutch Shell and BP, the largest European oil companies, might also be forced into cuts, although both have insisted that they will maintain their payouts.

A day after Chevron announced plans to slash its capital expenditure by nearly a quarter next year, rival US oil group ConocoPhillips has followed suit on Thursday with a massive cut of its own.In the latest sign that the energy industry believes a recovery in oil prices is still some way off, Conoco said it planned to invest $7.7bn next year, a 55 per cent reduction compared with 2014 and a 25 percent drop from 2015′s expected capital spending.Ryan Lance, Conoco chairman and chief executive said:We’re setting an operating plan for 2016 that recognizes the current environment, which remains challenging.

70;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Shell swings to $7.4bn loss on oil price slump and axed projects;Group records $8.2bn of one-off charges in third quarter and unveils 1,000 more job cuts;Royal Dutch Shell has taken a huge $8bn hit from the plunge in crude prices and its decisions to pull out of Alaska and axe a Canadian oil sands project.Reporting its largest quarterly net loss in at least 16 years, the Anglo-Dutch energy group said on Thursday that it was cutting another 1,000 jobs and was determined to “become a more focused and competitive company”.Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, described last month’s halt to a contentious exploration campaign in Alaska and the scrapping of its Carmon Creek oil sands project in western Canada as “difficult” decisions.After writing down its shale gas assets in the Marcellus and Utica regions of the US, Shell recorded $8.2bn in one-off charges, sending it to a net loss of $7.4bn in the three months to September 30, compared with a $4.5bn profit during the same period last year.“These charges reflect both a lower oil and gas price outlook and the firm steps we are taking to review and reduce Shell’s longer-term option set,” said Mr van Beurden.Shell’s A class shares closed down 1.5 per cent on Thursday at £17.12 in London.The slide in Brent crude, from a peak of more than $115 a barrel last year to less than $50 now, exacted a significant toll on the earnings of Shell and those of its competitors.Shell reported that third-quarter profit fell 70 per cent to $1.8bn — on a current cost of supplies basis, excluding identified items — from $5.8bn a year ago: a sharper than expected decline. Its upstream, or exploration and production business, recorded a loss.France’s Total reported a 23 per cent slide in adjusted net profit, to $2.8bn in the third quarter, while Italy’s Eni swung to a loss of €952m.ConocoPhillips, the largest of the US exploration and production companies, also slipped to a loss in the third quarter, of $1.1bn, partly driven by one-off costs.The company said it now planned capital spending of $10.2bn for 2015, down 39 per cent from the $16.7bn it spent in 2014.Shell’s decision to axe a Canadian project shows extent of the downturnRead moreThe sharp fall in oil prices, caused mainly by Opec’s decision last November not to cut production in the face of a US supply glut, has stoked fears that energy companies might fail to maintain dividends. More than $200bn of spending on big projects has been pushed back to try to cover those payouts.Like other US and European majors, Shell has been scrambling to shore up its balance sheet.Simon Henry, chief financial officer, said the group was increasing the number of job cuts from 6,500 to 7,500, and that capital spending this year would fall to less than $30bn, or about 20 per cent lower than in 2014.Shell said its proposed £39.8bn takeover of BG Group, which will bring deepwater oil and liquefied natural gas reserves, remained “on track” for completion in early 2016.But the Alaskan pullout, after a lengthy exploration campaign yielded just one dry well, and the decision to scrap Carmon Creek, have proved expensive.Unusually for a cancelled project of its size, Shell had already taken a decision to invest in Carmon Creek and work was under way. One analyst characterised the group’s action as “throwing the kitchen sink” at low oil prices. Several, though, said it was necessary to look through a “messy” set of results.Oswald Clint of Bernstein Research said: “Getting out of previous strategic mis-steps via the impairments is a necessary evil to allow the new lower-cost deepwater and LNG-focused Shell to emerge.”Additional reporting by Ed Crooks in New York
71;COP;Conocophillips;2015-07-30T16:38:33Z;Whole Foods tumbles as audit weighs on sales growth;Negative press on price audits in New York led to sharp fall;Whole Foods shares took a spill after the upmarket US grocer reported slowing same-store sales growth following price audits in New York that attracted negative press.The Austin, Texas-based company said same-store sales, a key industry metric, rose 1.3 per cent in the quarter, below forecasts for 2.8 per cent growth. The pace also cooled from the 3.6 per cent rise in the previous quarter.“Comparable sales dropped sharply in week 11, after our New York City weights and measures audit received national media attention and averaged just 0.4 per cent for the last two weeks of the quarter,” Walter Robb, chief executive, said.The Department of Consumer Affairs said in June that the grocer “routinely overstated the weights of its pre-packaged products”, which resulted in customers being overcharged.Comparable sales have seen “slight improvement” in the fourth quarter to date and Mr Robb said that the issues “were not systematic” but were caused by “inadvertent human error”.Whole Foods also blamed slower growth on an earlier Easter holiday and difficult comparisons with a year earlier when the supermarket chain discounted products in a bid to lift store traffic.The company has also faced increased competition as rivals seek to cash in on the demand for organic foods.Profits rose 2 per cent from a year earlier to $154m, or 43 cents a share, in the three months to July 5. Sales rose nearly 8 per cent to $3.6bn. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 45 cents a share on sales of $3.7bn.The stock was downgraded by four banks following the results.The retailer’s new store concept, called 365 by Whole Foods Market, targeted at millennial consumers, has also received mixed reviews. The “365 stores are likely to cannibalise” legacy locations and the rollout is “not meaningful in the near term”, Phil Terpolilli, an analyst at Wedbush, said.Shares of Whole Foods, which have declined 28 per cent so far this year, fell 11.6 per cent to $36.08.ConocoPhillips shares fell 1.5 per cent to $52.10 after the US oil and gas producer swung to a loss in the second quarter amid a protracted drop in oil prices.The Houston-based company reported a net loss of $179m, or 15 cents a share, below analysts estimates for earnings of 6 cents a share. This compared with profits of $2.1bn in the same period a year ago. Adjusting for one time items, however, earnings of 7 cents a share topped forecasts.Bunge shares fell 5.1 per cent to $81.27 after the company reported a 70 per cent drop in second-quarter profits.The White Plains, New York-based company, said a drop in profits at its Brazilian edible oils business, which experienced “dramatic pressure”, along with weak margins in its seed operations weighed on results.Qorvo was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, after the chipmaker’s second quarter outlook missed analysts’ expectations. Qorvo shares fell 14.2 per cent to $60.49.US stocks were mixed after the latest data showed US economic growth rebounding in the second quarter, with GDP expanding 2.3 per cent.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both were little changed at 2,108.63 and 17,745.98 respectively.

72;COP;Conocophillips;2015-07-16T18:28:06Z;Iran: The oil and gas multibillion-dollar ‘candy store’;Lifting sanctions should open the way for major oil groups to return to the country, but negotiations will be tough;They did not advertise their presence. But in the days and weeks before Tuesday’s nuclear deal between the west and Iran, a steady trickle of visitors from some of the world’s largest energy groups have flown into Tehran.By some accounts, they have done more than exchange business cards. As one senior western executive puts it, few of the industry’s big players can ignore the “candy store” that is Iran — now preparing to throw open a multibillion-dollar shop window of oil and gas projects.An array of US and EU oil-related sanctions, in place since 2012, has prevented detailed negotiations. But once these are lifted, serious talks about a return to the country will get under way, with the European majors first.For the likes of Royal Dutch Shell, Eni of Italy and France’s Total, among those whose officials have met Iranian counterparts in Tehran, that day may be months away. Negotiations with US energy groups — absent since the nationalisations that followed the 1979 Islamic revolution — could be even further off. A complex range of restrictions will need to be rolled back in the US.Even so, for cash-starved Iran, desperate to rehabilitate a domestic oil and gas industry laid low by mismanagement, corruption and under-investment, there is now the real prospect of a new lease of life — and a huge increase in revenues from higher production and exports. Tehran is estimated by the US to have foregone $160bn in oil sales in the past three years as exports to Europe collapsed and Asian countries such as India sought alternative supplies.“Iran needs investment and technology big time,” says Daniel Yergin, author of the classic history of oil, The Prize. But talks will be far from easy, requiring pragmatism from the Iranians after a 50 per cent plunge in oil prices. “What’s changed is the companies are no longer chasing barrels as they did when oil prices were going up. It is really now a buyers’ market when it comes to oil and gas deals,” he adds.“Tehran will need to put a century of turbulent relations with the international oil industry behind it and focus on being commercial and competitive. The big companies are preoccupied with costs and profitability.”Assuming key economic sanctions are removed by early 2016, Bijan Zanganeh, Iran’s oil minister, is confident it can swiftly raise output and exports, by as much as 1m barrels a day. A release of 40m barrels of oil stored on Iranian tankers is also thought likely, weighing further on prices.But his eyes are fixed on a greater prize. He wants western expertise to revive Iran’s ageing fields and creaking infrastructure, and restore its position as the fourth biggest producer after Saudi Arabia, the US and Russia. The goal is to increase output by 50 per cent in just five years, to as much as 5m b/d.Behind the scenes, and alongside the remaining diplomatic talks, work is already under way. Mehdi Hosseini, an adviser to Iran’s oil ministry, says Tehran is finalising a new-style contract that it hopes will lead to deals with foreign investors worth up to $100bn.As many as 50 projects could be up for grabs, with deals covering exploration, the development of onshore and offshore fields and the provision of new technology. They are likely to include the huge gasfields of South and North Pars, between them holding nearly 350tn cubic feet of undeveloped reserves, and major oilfields such as Ahvaz, Gachsaran, Marun and Aghajari, which were estimated to have held 200bn barrels of crude originally and have been producing for decades. There could be co-operation, too, in petrochemicals and liquefied natural gas.In particular, Tehran is said by industry insiders to be keen to bring in a foreign oil company to help with the construction of an LNG plant to handle the gas from South Pars, part of a reservoir Iran shares with Qatar. Among those rumoured as possible partners is Shell, which has pioneered gas-to-liquids technology and will be the biggest private sector LNG supplier after its proposed £55bn takeover of BG Group.“Qatar has gone far ahead of Iran,” says Mr Hosseini. “This injustice is because of sanctions. Our gas is produced from Qatari wells instead of ours. This hurts national feelings.”Iran’s appeal for foreign investors is clear. According to Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, the country ranks as the world’s third-largest holder of oil and gas, with more than 250bn barrels of oil equivalent in remaining reserves.Unlike, say, the unexplored Arctic, its resources have been mapped and production costs are low. Its political stability relative to that of Iraq, riven by conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, is another attraction. Indeed, with energy groups struggling to make big discoveries , Wood Mackenzie says Iran offers a “golden” opportunity for integrated oil companies and nationally owned giants.“We still need to review the details, especially regarding sanctions removal” says Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of Total. “[But] Total has a long history in Iran and is willing to go back when the sanctions are lifted and if the conditions are interesting.”Mr Zanganeh will set out Tehran’s terms of engagement — a set of conditions known as the Iran Petroleum Contract and billed as more rewarding than past deals — later this year. The big question is whether the contracts will be sufficiently attractive. While Tehran will not offer production-sharing deals, preferred by most foreign investors, it will enhance the terms of its widely disliked service or “buyback” contracts. Fereidun Fesharaki of consultancy Facts Global Energy says they will “look and smell” more like production sharing deals, where foreign companies win the rights to output and reserves, and risk is shared.The new contracts will enable foreign companies to set up joint ventures with the state-owned National Iranian Oil Company or one of its subsidiaries. They are expected to run for longer, say 20 to 30 years. Remuneration will be more flexible. Instead of a fixed fee, rates of return would be based on a sliding scale and proportionate to risks surrounding development. Payments could be linked to oil prices. It is thought there will be no cap on capital spending.Crucially, companies will also be able to book the value of reserves on their balance sheets. But, says Elham Hassanzadeh of consultancy Energy Pioneers, this will be subject to “strict conditions”. Iranian law forbids foreign ownership of reserves and Mr Hosseini says: “If the booking of reserves is interpreted as a transfer of ownership to the IOCs, we [Iran] will not let that happen.”He adds that international oil companies have been sounded out on the details and the response has been positive. But one European executive denies any such involvement, while another is sceptical. Describing the flat fees paid under the old service contracts — which lasted from six to 12 years — as “lousy”, he believes a meeting of minds with Iranian officials, known as tough negotiators, will be elusive. “Companies will be active, but I’m uncertain we will see an immediate explosion in contracts.”One western oil observer in Tehran, who claims to have seen elements of the contracts, also questions the benefits. The proposed terms bear little resemblance to production sharing, he says. Capital, investment and output would not be shared, nor would financing risk.Moreover, political and legal uncertainties remain. The nuclear agreement could swiftly unravel and sanctions be reimposed if Iran breached the terms of the deal.Oil executives will be wary, too, of requests that they work with local suppliers suspected of links with Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, which have in the past benefited from big contract awards. The fact that NIOC was designated by the US as an affiliate of the guards could damage the reputation of any company doing business with it.For those companies that do invest, there is also the threat of legal action from individuals with claims against Iran based on its support for terrorism. Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think-tank, says about $18bn has been awarded in US courts to plaintiffs against Iran. Efforts could be made to enforce those awards against any companies with operations there.Nor should the technical hurdles be underestimated. Sanctions have taken a heavy toll on output. Crude production capacity has dropped to about 2.8m b/d, from 3.6m b/d in 2011. Natural gas output slowed to 5.7 tcf in 2013. “Many wells have been shut down. Some may have been damaged so much that we need to have new ones,” says Mr Hosseini. Per Magnus Nysveen at consultants Rystad Energy says: “I don’t want to be overly pessimistic. There is the potential for a large amount of condensate [ultralight oil] production and exports. However, with crude production, I’m more sceptical.”Mr Nysveen points to the Marun, Ahvaz, Gachsaran and Aghajari fields, where recovery rates are as low as 25 per cent, demanding heavy spending. Projects such as South Azadegan and extensions to South Pars — where Tehran has been unhappy with its Chinese partners — have also suffered problems. “A lot of industrial activity needs to be done to stimulate these fields, such as drilling and water and gas injection,” he adds.Even if projects are agreed in months, actual implementation will take years, and analysts say the investment needed could easily rise to $200bn. Wood Mackenzie sees crude production rising to 3.4m b/d by 2020, less than Tehran’s target, but adds that output could reach 4.4m b/d in a decade with enough foreign investment. Gas has “enormous” potential in the longer run.It is suspected that Iran wants US expertise, though officials insist it has no preference. Such a return would be momentous. But ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are well behind their European rivals in positioning for a lifting of sanctions as US regulations are more restrictive. American companies have been estranged from Iran for longer and the threat of legal action against any business that tries to invest there is greater.Legislation and executive orders impose such wide-ranging restrictions on US business dealings with the country that American companies take them to mean that even hypothetical discussions about post-sanctions contracts are illegal. Not one US oil company says it has held talks about possible deals with Iran. Exxon’s understanding of the law is that its executives are barred from talking about business with any Iranian officials. Chevron says that it “acts in full compliance with US law and does not engage in business discussions with Iran.” Conoco, similarly, says it is not engaged in any such talks.For now, they will not even be drawn on their interest in Iran should conditions change.Deals, eventually, will be struck. But do not expect a stampede: “Big Oil” will be treading carefully in this sweet shop.Additional reporting by Anjli RavalThe return of Iran to international oil markets comes at a time when global supplies are already far exceeding demand. And while few expect the process of unwinding international sanctions to be completed before 2016, Iran has made clear it plans to ramp up exports as quickly as possible.This will probably create new headwinds for the oil price which has halved in the past 12 months. Analysts estimate Iran could add 250,000-700,000 barrels a day of exports next year, with more to follow. Opec, the oil producer group, was already forecasting a surplus of at least 1m b/d next year before the Iranian deal. Before sanctions started directly targeting its oil exports four years ago Iran was exporting almost 2.5m b/d, more than double its current level.Saudi Arabia and other large Gulf producers have also signalled they will not readily make way for Iran’s barrels. Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, views Shia-majority Iran as its regional rival and is not minded to do it any favours. Riyadh has already increased production to a record level of 10.6m barrels a day — an increase of roughly 1m b/d since the end of last year. Kuwait and Iraq have also raised output despite falling prices.Goldman Sachs this week said the Iran deal poses a “downside risk” to its 2016 Brent crude oil price forecast of $62 a barrel. Brent, the international benchmark, was trading near $58 a barrel yesterday.While forecasting the future direction of the crude market is notoriously difficult — few predicted the impact of the US shale boom — on balance the Iran nuclear deal means one thing for the oil price: lower for longer than it otherwise would be.

73;COP;Conocophillips;2015-06-04T13:08:35Z;ConocoPhillips says Opec will not halt the advance of US shale;CEO says unconventional oil production will survive with Brent crude at $60 per barrel;"Opec, the oil producers’ cartel, will not be able to stop the US shale industry in spite of lower crude prices, the chief executive of ConocoPhillips told a summit on Thursday.Ryan Lance, who has steered ConocoPhillips to invest more heavily in US shale than almost any other multinational energy company, said break-even costs for this unconventional oil and gas production were down by almost one-third since the crude price crash and would keep falling.Brent, the international crude benchmark, has fallen more than 40 per cent since last summer, with sharp declines following Opec’s landmark decision last November to maintain rather than cut its output.Saudi Arabia, the leading Opec member, last month claimed success with its strategy of letting prices fall and squeezing high-cost rivals such as US shale producers, as the world’s largest crude exporter seeks to reassert itself as the dominant force in the global oil market.Opec, which as a group pumps about one-third of the world’s oil, is widely expected at its twice-yearly production meeting on Friday in Vienna to agree to keep the taps wide open.“US shale is here to stay,” Mr Lance told an audience at the Opec International Seminar in Vienna, which was filled with ministers from the cartel.“I am fond of using a baseball analogy that we are in the second inning of a nine-inning game…We still have a lot of efficiency gains that the industry is going to make.”Shale has transformed the outlook for energy security in the US, and reversed the longstanding decline in the country’s oil output.ConocoPhillips is active in the biggest US shale fields including North Dakota’s Bakken formation, and the Eagle Ford in Texas. It is also working in the Niobrara formation, which stretches through Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska, and Barnett in Texas.“I was here in 2012 to talk about the renaissance in unconventional production and what’s been proven over the last three years is that [shale oil] is a remarkable business, the technology improvements we have made, the efficiency improvements we have made,” Mr Lance told the Opec seminar.“This business will survive at $100 Brent pricing, it will survive at $60 Brent pricing,“ he said.Brent hit a six-year low near $45 a barrel in January after years of trading above $100. It has since recovered to about $63.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingMr Lance predicted oil prices would slowly improve in the coming months, after shale producers slashed the number of rigs in response to the crash.“As prices stabilise or start to improve a little bit you’ll see the rig count start to improve and come back as we go in 2016-17 and create more supply into the system,” he said.“You’ll see some moderated growth but if prices advance as demand picks up you’ll see continued growth from North America shale.”Mr Lance also said there was a “very real probability” that the de facto ban on exports of US crude could be lifted in the next two years.ConocoPhillips has been a vocal opponent of the ban in recent years, and Mr Lance said: “We believe over the next couple of years it is an important public policy issue that the US will have to grapple with.”"
74;COP;Conocophillips;2015-05-18T17:00:29Z;Energy groups take knife to $100bn of spending after oil rout;Delays and cancellations of new projects will curb output in coming years;"More than $100bn of spending on new projects by the world’s energy companies has been slowed, postponed or axed following the oil price plunge, evidence of the drastic industry action that will curb output in coming years.Companies including Royal Dutch Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips and Statoil have led moves to curtail capital spending on 26 major projects worldwide, according to analysis commissioned for the Financial Times.The delays and cancellations, many disclosed quietly in recent weeks and months, come amid a wider retrenchment by the industry that has seen thousands lose their jobs and led to a slowdown in the US shale boom.The research by consultancy Rystad Energy shows that producers have targeted some of the highest-cost areas as they have trimmed spending, with nine Canadian oil sands projects put back, each ranging from $1bn to $10bn in planned expenditure.“Things are moving to the right and the particular area that is suffering is western Canada,” said Alastair Syme, energy analyst at Citigroup.“It is one area of the world outside US shale, where companies are actually stopping investment in train.”After reaching $115 a barrel last June, the price of oil plummeted to a low of $45 in January, as surging output of US shale oil and softening demand in Asia stoked a glut in the market. The decline accelerated after Opec, led by Saudi Arabia, decided not to cut production to support prices. Crude has since rebounded to around $66.While the $118bn total expenditure would be spread over several years, the impact of deferring investment on such projects would be to delay future production, with as many as 1.5m barrels a day — nearly 2 per cent of global oil output in 2013 — to come two years later than planned, said Rystad.The project deferrals that have already been announced could be just the start of a big wave of delays. Goldman Sachs has identified 61 new projects, more than half of those awaiting final approval, as uneconomic at an oil price of $60 a barrel, putting more than $750bn of capital expenditure at risk and 10.5m barrels a day of peak production.Energy groups’ $100bn in cuts laid bare

. . . and why nothing will ever be the same againSeventeen countries, including Angola, Nigeria, Australia and Algeria, were likely to see investment in projects fall by more than 50 per cent between now and 2020 assuming prices stayed low, Goldman’s Michele della Vigna said.Calgary-based Cenovus Energy said it had deferred work on its 130,000 barrels a day Narrows Lake oil sands development “due to the substantial decline in crude oil prices”. It added: “We are taking advantage of the slower pace of development to optimise our engineering and execution strategy.”Other “heavy” oil projects, where extraction is closer to mining than conventional drilling, have been halted. Carlos Cabrera, executive chairman of Ivanhoe Energy, told the FT that its Pungarayacu project in Ecuador had been suspended in part because “the precipitous drop in the oil price” had rendered uneconomic production of a possible 2bn-3bn barrels.US-based Conoco, meanwhile, confirmed it had “stopped” developing the Tommeliten Alpha discovery, southwest of the Ekofisk field in the Norwegian North Sea. Nils Andersen, chief executive of Denmark’s Maersk Group, said last week it was “renegotiating” supply deals for its “challenged” deepwater Chissonga project in Angola.“The oil situation has changed due to low oil price and we aim to reduce the investment level as a result of that,” he said.One of the biggest developments to be shelved, Shell’s Arrow liquefied natural gas plant in Australia, accounted for almost a quarter of the spending Rystad said had been put back or cut. The consultancy examined projects with reserves of at least 50m barrels of oil equivalent.Other data illustrate the speed with which oil companies have reacted to the crude price collapse. According to Morgan Stanley, which has looked at capex guidance for 2015 from more than 120 companies, their investment is expected to drop by a quarter this year, from $520bn to $389bn.The severity of the capex cuts could lead to a substantial rebound in Brent crude. The bank expects oil to rise from $66 a barrel to $85 in 2017. “The longer oil prices remain low, the more prices may rise longer term, given that current weakness discourages future investment.”Additional reporting by Guy ChazanLetter in response to this report:Time for governments to price in the true cost of oil / Bob Ward"

Fuelled by demand from China’s middle classes, iPhone sales leapt 40 per cent to 61.2m units.“You can’t grow those kinds of numbers without getting significantly into the middle class,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive.A 50 per cent increase in Apple’s share buybacks and dividends meant that the group plans to return a total of $200bn by the end of March 2017.Apple CFO says Apple Watch sales “very good” compared to iPad launch, writes Tim Bradshaw.However, investors seem uncertain about whether the iPhone’s growth rate can be sustained and how much demand there is for the Apple Watch, with the company refusing to reveal sales figures.Apple’s shares fell back about 5 per cent in the days following its quarterly numbers, as reports emerged of production problems holding up supplies of the watch and a small number of early buyers who had complained that its heart-rate monitor failed to work on tattooed skin.The European Commission’s investigation into its tax deals with Ireland is also looming. Apple warned in a regulatory filing after its earnings that if Ireland is required to recover up to 10 years of back taxes, the amount could have a “material” impact on its finances— potentially billions of dollars.● Related FT Data blog post: Apple’s cash pile

One was that downstream refining and chemicals operations generally thrived while upstream oil and gas production was suffering. The other was that, within that generally difficult outlook, it was oil and gas production in North America that was hit the hardest.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest listed oil company by market capitalisation, reported a $52m loss from its US upstream operations, impacted by average selling prices that were 55 per cent lower for oil and 47 per cent lower for gas than in the equivalent period of 2014.The former US Fed chairman looks to steer Pimco through policy mazeContinue readingOverall, the group reported a 46 per cent drop in post-tax profit to $4.94bn, supported by earnings from refining that doubled to $1.67bn.Royal Dutch Shell, the largest listed European oil group, posted a 56 per cent post-tax profit fall to $3.2bn, also helped by a steep rise in earnings from refining.BP managed to limit the drop in its profit to just 20 per cent, owing to more than doubled earnings of $2.2bn from its downstream operations. That included $350m in above-normal profit from its trading unit, one of the industry’s most active.The downside of not having downstream operations was shown by ConocoPhillips, which spun off those units in 2012. It reported an 87 per cent drop in earnings to $272m.● Related news story: US loss suppresses Chevron earnings

But expansion is not the only goal, Walmart global chief executive Doug McMillon told a Beijing press conference this week. “Our goal is not to be the biggest retailer in China, we want to be the most trusted retailer.”The company also said it would renovate 50 existing stores and launch a home-shopping app.Walmart has struggled with food-safety issues in China — a market where foreign brands trade on their reputation for quality, so any safety flaws are particularly bad for brand image.But it is far from the only foreign grocer to struggle in China in recent years, where shopper habits have changed rapidly in the face of growing affluence and the speedy rise of ecommerce.Tesco, the UK chain, failed to make it alone on the mainland and was forced into a joint venture with a leading local retailer, China Resources Enterprise, which has also struggled to turn round its ailing business. Competition from online grocers is one of the biggest threats to bricks-and-mortar sales.Alliance Trust chief remains after 11th-hour fund dealKatherine Garrett-Cox has survived. The Alliance Trust chief executive remained at the helm of the 127-year-old Scottish group after agreeing a last-minute deal with US hedge fund Elliott this week, writes David Oakley in London.But institutional investors said the deal, which meant two out of three of Elliott’s proposed directors gain places on the board, was a Pyrrhic victory for the feisty Alliance boss, who has been given a year to turn round performance.Retail investors who gathered in Dundee for the group’s annual meeting booed and jeered when they heard that the board had spent £3m fighting proposals from the activist New York hedge fund before drawing up the truce.Karin Forseke, Alliance chairman who had previously urged shareholders not to support Elliott, admitted that the ceasefire was a U-turn on Alliance’s part and had been agreed after the board realised the trust might not have won over enough support to vote down the plan.Alliance also staved off a revolt over pay, even though Elliott had attacked Ms Garrett-Cox’s remuneration, which has doubled in five years to £1.4m.The deal brought to an end a six-week battle between the groups that had become increasingly bitter. Elliott was the second activist to square up with Ms Garrett-Cox after she faced a campaign against her from Laxey Partners in 2011.An institutional investor said: “She has survived two attacks, but she has to pull performance round now, or it will be the end for her.”● Related news story: Individual shareholders put Alliance Trust board on notice

Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell disclosed a $1.1bn loss at its upstream exploration and production business in the Americas, and suggested that came mostly from its shale oil and gas operations.Statoil, Norway’s national oil company, reported a loss from its international upstream operations, which include the US and Canada, and a writedown of about $5.5bn on the value of its North American assets, including shale oil and gas reserves and offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico.The figures show how the profitability of North American production, which is relatively high cost compared to oil from other areas including the Middle East, has been hit particularly hard by the fall in crude prices. Natural gas prices have also fallen more sharply in North America than in the rest of the world.Simon Henry, Shell’s chief financial officer, told analysts the company’s deep water production and heavy oil in the Americas, including the Canadian oil sands, were “about break even”, excluding currency effects.However, he said Shell’s North American shale oil and gas operations faced a “challenge” from low selling prices. “I think it’s fair to say everybody is showing either a loss in the Americas or very close,” he added.BP on Tuesday reported a $545m loss on its US production business in the first quarter.Irene Himona, an analyst at Société Générale, said pricing was “very disadvantageous” for international oil companies’ US operations.“No one’s cost structure can be covered” by gas prices at current levels, she added.Exxon, the world’s largest private sector oil group, reported a 46 per cent drop in its earnings to $4.94bn during the three months to March 31, including a $52m loss from oil and gas production in the US.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Its earnings per share were down 44 per cent at $1.17.The company on Wednesday announced a 6 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend to 73 cents.Shell, Europe’s largest oil group, reported a 56 per cent drop in earnings to $3.2bn, excluding one-off items.46%Drop in Exxon earnings to $4.94bn during the three months to March 31Its upstream profit fell to just $675m, from $5.7bn a year ago, a decline of 88 per cent, and including a loss of $1.09bn in the Americas. That was offset by a 68 per cent jump in earnings from refining and chemicals, to $2.65bn.Conoco, which spun off its refining, chemicals and pipeline business as Phillips 66 in 2012, reported an 87 per cent drop in earnings per share to 22 cents.It made an underlying loss of $222m, excluding one-off items such as tax benefits, with a $243m loss from its US operations.Ryan Lance, Conoco’s chief executive, said the fall in prices was a “test” for the industry, and the company was focused on factors that it could control, including production growth and cost reductions.Conoco reported a 12 per cent drop in underlying operating costs compared to the first quarter of 2014.I think it’s fair to say everybody is showing either a loss in the Americas or very closeOther companies also said they were cutting costs. Mr Henry said Shell aimed to “take the cost out forever . . . not just temporarily”.Statoil said it was writing down the value of its assets in the US and Canada as a result of changes in the company’s long-term economic assumptions.Eldar Sætre, its chief executive, said: “We take a more cautious view due to the uncertainty in the commodity markets.”However, he added: “The assets can be improved significantly …and I am very optimistic about the future.”Further writedowns in US assets were possible, said Mr Sætre, but equally likely was that their value would appreciate. The company expects the price of Brent crude, which was trading at $66 on Thursday, will rise to $80 by 2018.First-quarter losses almost triple at PemexPemex on Thursday reported that its first quarter net loss this year almost tripled to 100.6bn pesos ($6.4bn) compared to one year ago, hit by lower production, falling crude prices and foreign exchange losses, writes Jude Webber in Mexico City.It was the Mexican state-controlled company’s 10th consecutive quarterly loss, and helps explain why the government is introducing sweeping energy reform that will open the country’s oil and gas prospects to private investment for the first time since Pemex was formed in 1938.The government hopes the reform will boost production, and the first exploration blocks will be awarded on July 15.Pemex, which has been struggling to reverse a decade-long production decline, said net sales slumped to 280bn pesos in the three months to March 31, from 407bn during the same period last year.Pemex’s head of production, Gustavo Hernández, said average first-quarter crude production was some 2.3m barrels per day, a decline of 7.7 per cent compared to one year ago. Production of heavy crude fell almost 12 per cent.But Mr Hernández said the company was not reducing its annual production forecast.He told the Financial Times earlier this month that production declines at Pemex had touched bottom, and the company was in the process of getting back to growth."

Natural gas prices have also fallen more sharply in the US than in the rest of the world.For Exxon, the impact was offset by its large refining business, which reported profits more than doubled at $1.67bn, including profits from refineries outside the US that rose more than fivefold to $1.1bn.Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive, hailed the group’s “balanced portfolio”, and said it was focusing on long-term value, “regardless of current market conditions”.Its earnings per share were down 44 per cent at $1.17.The company on Wednesday announced a 6 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend to 73 cents.Conoco, which spun off its refining, chemicals and pipeline business as Phillips 66 in 2012, reported an 87 per cent drop in earnings per share to 22 cents.Ryan Lance, Conoco’s chief executive, said the fall in prices was a “test” for the industry, and the company was focused on factors that it could control, including production growth and cost reductions.He added that the measures the company had taken “will position us for strong future performance in what we expect could be a more favourable commodity price environment”.Exxon says it sold its US crude for an average of $42.20 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015, less than half its realised price of $93.18 per barrel in the equivalent period of 2014.Its selling price for gas in the US dropped almost as sharply, from $4.78 per thousand cubic feet to $2.53. North American shale gas production has remained very strong in spite of the plunge in prices.Outside the US, gas is often sold on contracts linked to the oil price, usually with a lag, and Exxon’s selling prices also declined, although less sharply. It received an average of $7.53 per thousand cu ft for non-US gas, down from $10.59 in the first quarter of 2014.46%ExxonMobil’s drop in its earnings to $4.94bn for the quarterConoco reported similar price falls.Both companies said they had been cutting spending to adjust to lower prices, with Conoco reporting a 14 per cent drop in capital spending to $3.33bn in the first quarter, and Exxon a 9 per cent drop to $7.7bn. Mr Lance said he expected Conoco’s spending to continue to slow down through the year.Conoco also reported a 12 per cent drop in underlying operating costs compared with the first quarter of 2014.However, both companies have been increasing production. Exxon’s oil and gas output was up 2 per cent at 4.2m barrels of oil equivalent per day, helped by the impact of lower prices that meant it needed to allow less for its partners under production-sharing contracts. Conoco’s production was up 5 per cent at 1.61m boe/d, excluding its Libyan operations which have been hit by the conflict in the country.
78;COP;Conocophillips;2015-04-20T21:30:25Z;Senator plans bill to lift US oil export ban;Lisa Murkowski says legislation is needed in 2015 to overturn law that hurts consumers at the pump;The US Senate’s leading advocate for a repeal of America’s longstanding ban on oil exports plans to introduce a bill this year that would open the way for millions of barrels a day of crude sales into international markets.Lisa Murkowski, a senator from oil-rich Alaska and chair of the energy committee, said on Monday that 2015 should be “the year of legislation” to lift the 40-year old ban on exporting most domestic US crude.The ban is politically sensitive because lawmakers in both parties fear a repeal could lead to them being blamed for higher petrol prices, even though economists say there is no reason to fear a price spike at the pump.Energy executives say the US public has not yet adjusted to the country’s status as a shale superpower, noting that older citizens still recall fuel shortages and long petrol queues during the energy crises of the 1970s.Speaking at the energy industry’s annual CERA Week conference in Houston, Ms Murkowski said: “I am making clear today that I plan to introduce legislation that fully repeals our nation’s outdated export ban.”She said the possible easing of sanctions against Iran, following agreement with the west over its nuclear ambitions, could lead to some 1m b/d of Iranian exports and that the US itself would lose out.“The [US] export ban equates to a sanctions regime against ourselves,” she said. “It hurts American consumers, whose prices at the pump are higher than they would be otherwise.”“The [US] export ban equates to a sanctions regime against ourselves It hurts American consumers, whose prices at the pump are higher than they would be otherwiseWe shouldn’t lift sanctions on Iranian oil while we are keeping sanctions on American oil. It makes no sense.”Legislation to repeal the ban is likely to face an uphill struggle in Congress.Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the energy committee, believes that “we need to understand how changing the policy would affect our communities, especially in terms of gasoline prices” said a spokeswoman. She has requested an analysis of the likely impacts on fuel prices and transportation in the Pacific Northwest, her home region.Beyond petrol prices, the ban pits Republicans who say exports will encourage more shale energy production against pro-ban Democrats who are worried about the environmental effects of more drilling or do not want to disrupt the oil supply to local refineries.Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, described the ban as “anti-consumer” and said the senator’s plan was “a good first step”.“Certainly I’m optimistic we can get something done in 2015. I recognise it’s a long hill to climb,” he said.Late last year the Obama administration tweaked the rules to allow more overseas sales of lightly processed oil called condensate, but Republicans said that was not enough.As US shale producers cut back their activity due to the low oil price, most economists agree that large-scale US oil exports would lower the international oil price even further by increasing global supply.But there is no consensus on the likely magnitude of the impact and exports could still help US producers’ profits by closing a gap between the Brent crude price and the US crude price, known as West Texas Intermediate, which is about $7 per barrel below the international benchmark.Ms Murkowksi also called for more exemptions to the ban under existing law, saying the US should be able to export crude to its Nato allies.“Nothing prevents America’s trading partners from asking us for exemptions . . . Why stop with just Canada and Mexico? Why not members of Nato, such as Italy, which relied on Libya for some 21 per cent of its oil, or Poland, which relies on Russia,” said Ms Murkowski.The senator has not yet decided whether she will put forward a standalone bill or attach it to a broader package of energy reforms or some other legislation, a spokesman said.“She’s maintaining her flexibility to maximise her chances of success,” he said.

That is the biggest miss since December 2009.The soft data, coupled with the lofty valuations of many US stocks, had prompted many to brace for a broad sell-off when Wall Street reopened on Monday.Instead the main indices held their grounds. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 2,080.62 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent to 17,880.85. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also rose 0.6 per cent to 4,917.32.Among the movers, Garmin fell as much as 4 per cent before paring back losses after analysts at Citi downgraded the stock to “sell” from “buy” and slashed its price target from $68 to $42. The investment bank said the Swiss company, whose portable fitness tracker business has been helping to offset the decline in its traditional GPS device business, would probably miss earnings and sales expectations in its first quarter, as competitors such as Apple and Fitbit muscle in on the fitness space with new offerings.“We now believe competitive pressures are likely to start eroding Garmin’s stronghold in the GPS fitness watch business which generated around 60 per cent of Garmin’s fitness sales last year,” Citi said. By the close of trading on Monday, shares were little changed at $46.71.Shares in uniQure surged more than 47 per cent to $33.61 after the biomedical company struck a deal with pharma heavyweight Bristol-Myers Squibb that values it at nearly $600m. Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers will, among other things, acquire an initial stake of 4.9 per cent in the company at $33.84 a share in exchange for exclusive access to uniQure’s gene therapy technology.Tesla Motors, whose shares have fallen almost 30 per cent since hitting a high of 286.04 last September, rallied 6 per cent to $203.10 after it reported on Friday a 55 per cent increase in deliveries in the first quarter of this year.Ventas gained 5 per cent to $76.90 after it agreed to buy hospital operator Ardent Medical Services for $1.75bn in cash. Ventas said the deal would bring 14 hospitals into its portfolio, which it believes will increase its normalised funds from operations by 8 to 10 cents a share in the first year after the purchase closes.Shares in energy companies followed oil prices higher. Both Brent and WTI were up more than 5 per cent on Monday after Saudi Arabia increased prices on the oil it sells in Asia, a decision that signals rising demand in the region. Transocean led the gains, advancing 10 per cent to $16.51. It was followed by Halliburton, which rose 4 per cent to $45.88 and ConocoPhillips, up 4 per cent at $65.39. The S&P 500 energy index gained 2 per cent.
80;COP;Conocophillips;2015-03-23T10:33:22Z;Shale oil producers blame export ban for low US crude price;Industry says restrictions magnify the impact of falling commodities;US shale oil producers are becoming increasingly concerned about the gap that has opened up between domestic and internationally traded crude prices, which they say is exacerbating the problems they face.The spread between West Texas Intermediate and internationally traded Brent has widened sharply since January, and was about $9 on Friday, representing a discount of about 16 per cent for US crude.Producers campaigning against US restrictions on crude exports say the regulations are responsible for part of that gap.Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, told a Senate energy committee hearing last week that the discount for US oil magnified the impact of the fall in crude prices since last summer.“We are at a competitive disadvantage,” he said. “Our overseas competitors . . . are developing around the world at higher price than we’re getting for the product that is of similar quality.”Mr Lance said most US shale oil production would be uneconomic at an oil price of $40 per barrel. WTI ended Friday at about $46 per barrel.Other companies have raised similar concerns. Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, another large shale producer, earlier this month told the energy committee of the House of Representatives that US companies were disadvantaged compared with foreign producers because they could not receive global prices.He added: “If current trends continue and the export ban is not lifted, US shale oil production will flatten or decline by disproportionate volumes versus our overseas competitors.”Producers have raised concerns about the faster-than-usual build-up of crude in US inventories. Storage tanks have been filling up at the rate of about 1.2m barrels per day over the past four weeks, and crude inventories are now at their highest relative to demand from refiners since the mid-1980s.US crude production has so far continued to grow in spite of the slump in activity, with rigs drilling for oil in the US down 49 per cent since October according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company. The Energy Information Administration’s weekly data show US crude production rising to 9.42m barrels per day this month.US crude exports have been rising, and reached a record 442,00 b/d in December, with the great majority of that going to Canada, but still account for less than 5 per cent of production.Several analysts have argued that liberalising crude exports would help US producers.IHS, a research company, last week published a study backed by leading companies arguing that liberalisation would increase investment and employment in US oil production and related services.Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of IHS, said more US shale oil developments were on the margin of being economically viable as a result of the drop in crude prices of more than 50 per cent since last summer.“At the current level of prices, the export ban is an even more urgent problem,” Mr Yergin said. “A smaller price discount is much more destructive.”Robin West of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the regulations were “helping Opec to smother US production, which is bad for our economy as well as our energy security”.However, US refiners, which benefit from lower domestic crude prices, have argued against liberalisation.If current trends continue and the export ban is not lifted, US shale oil production will flatten or decline by disproportionate volumes versus our overseas competitorsThe American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a group that represent refiners, said export controls should be relaxed only as part of a broader move to free up oil transport.Charles Drevna, the AFPM’s president, said: “I’d like to be in the meeting where an elected official can say they’ve voted for something that makes it less expensive for foreigners to buy US crude than for Americans.”He added that as recently as January WTI crude had briefly traded above the Brent price.“Let’s not base policy on a snapshot in time,” he said.Export restrictions are not the only reason that WTI diverges from Brent crude: transport costs and other factors can also be important. Light Louisiana Sweet, oil on the Gulf of Mexico coast often used as a benchmark for crude that could be exported if restrictions were eased, was $53.44 per barrel on Friday, about $2 less than Brent, according to Argus, the price reporting service.Crude at the Magellan East Houston terminal, also close to the coast, was $49.53 per barrel, about $6 less than Brent, according to Platts, another reporting service.

The result eclipsed projections for $8.24 a share.Sales climbed 19 per cent to $1.8bn, also ahead of expectations, as bookings of travel services jumped 17 per cent to $10.7bn in the quarter. The company said bookings growth was 23 per cent on a constant currency basis.“All businesses performed well despite foreign exchange headwinds,” Brian Fitzgerald, an analyst with Jefferies, said. “Unit growth decelerated but remained strong in hotel room nights and car rentals.”Priceline shares advanced 8 per cent to $1,218.05. Rival TripAdvisor rose 3 per cent to $88.49 while Expedia climbed 2 per cent to $91.26.Rising stockpiles of US crude weighed on the energy sector on Thursday as cuts to capital expenditures in the sector and a steady decline in oil rigs has so far failed to crimp supply.The latest report from the Energy Information Administration showed inventories of US crude rose by 7.7m barrels in the week to February 13, taking total stocks to 425.6m — the highest level recorded at this point in February in 80 years.Brent, the international crude benchmark, fell 0.5 per cent to $60.21 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate prices, the US standard, declined 1.9 per cent to $51.16 a barrel.US energy stocks sold off on the report, lagging behind the broader market’s marginal gain. The S&P 500 energy index fell 0.8 per cent to 590.83 while the small-cap S&P 600 energy index rose 0.4 per cent to 1,085.57.ExxonMobil shares declined 2 per cent to $89.44, Transocean fell 2 per cent to $17.41 and Anadarko Petroleum slipped 1 per cent to $86.10. ConocoPhillips was little changed.Castlight Health shares tumbled 31 per cent to $6.54 after the company forecast full-year results shy of analyst forecasts, prompting a downgrade from buy to hold from brokerage Canaccord Genuity.The healthcare enterprise software company, which completed an initial public offering last March that valued it at more than $3.4bn, said 2015 sales were likely to range between $74m-$77m, as much as 9 per cent below consensus forecasts.“Bookings give us pause, no room for slip-up at these valuations,” Richard Davis Jr, an analyst with Canaccord, said. “When you are highly valued and projected to lose over 60 per cent in [free cash flow] for every dollar of revenue, you cannot have equivocal results and expect a stock to outperform.”The share price slide wiped nearly $250m from Castlight’s valuation, taking it to $607m.Overall, US equities were little changed as better than expected initial jobless claims were offset by the slide in oil prices.The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,097.45 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.2 per cent to 17,985.77.

82;COP;Conocophillips;2015-02-03T17:42:30Z;BP chief warns of oil industry slump;Energy groups curb spending to preserve cash flow and dividends;"BP chief executive Bob Dudley warned on Tuesday that the oil industry faces its worst slump since 1986, with crude prices likely to stay at sharply lower levels for “several years” after plunging more than 50 per cent since last summer.His bleak prognosis for the industry — in the grip of “a raging gale” — came as the fall in crude triggered steep cuts to capital spending and jobs at both BP and BG Group, two of Europe’s biggest energy groups. Cnooc, China’s third-largest producer, also announced spending cuts.The moves by BP, BG Group and Cnooc were the latest in a wave of measures by the world’s biggest energy groups designed to shore up cash flow and protect dividends.Mr Dudley, speaking to reporters, said Opec members had told him they wanted to “fundamentally test” the oil market to see if US shale producers who had led America’s output boom could continue pumping crude at lower prices.His comments point to a battle of wills ahead in the market as Saudi Arabia and other Opec members wait to discover if their decision in November — not to cut output in the face of weaker than expected global demand — knocks out higher cost production elsewhere.“When I talk to [Opec members], what they seem to be saying is the world has developed high cost oil in the US, and some in Canada, and why should they be required to shut in their low cost production to allow more and more high cost oil to come on to the market that’s economic at $100 [a barrel],” said Mr Dudley.“They do not want to give up market share to high cost oil if they don’t have to. I think they are going to see this through.”He said that a “lot of places in the US” would be challenged and cited a sharp fall in drilling rig counts as a “leading indicator” of what to expect. US output would continue to rise until the summer, then flatten out and start to fall away, but it would not “drop like a stone”, he added.Andrew Gould, interim executive chairman of BG Group, also likened the collapse in oil prices to that of 1986, when big additions to world supply led to a protracted decline in the cost of crude.BP and BG Group reported billions of dollars in asset writedowns and headline losses for the fourth quarter of 2014.However, BP’s underlying earnings of $2.2bn in the last three months of 2014, lower than the $2.8bn in the same period in 2013, surpassed analysts’ expectations after an accounting change at Rosneft meant the UK group did not suffer from the rouble’s slide. BP has a 19.75 per cent stake in the Russian energy company.A $3.6bn post-tax charge in the fourth quarter — largely reflecting impairments to assets in the North Sea and Angola — led to a $969m headline loss at BP. Mr Dudley echoed Royal Dutch Shell’s calls last week for the UK government to introduce North Sea tax cuts.BP increased the amount it has set aside to cover the cost of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico to $43.5bn.Iain Reid, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said BP had “more than delivered” on its target to generate annual operating cash flow of $30bn to $31bn by 2014, reporting $32.8bn last year.BP said it would cut capital expenditure by 13 per cent this year compared to 2014, to about £20bn. It is considering postponing its Mad Dog deepwater project in the Gulf of Mexico.In December, the company announced a $1bn restructuring charge to cover planned job losses. Shares in BP rose 2.5 per cent on Tuesday to 448.5p as crude rallied off recent lows to $56.Meanwhile, BG Group outlined a cut of up to 30 per cent in capital spending this year, to between $6bn and $7bn.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingThe bulk of the company’s $8.9bn of impairment charges in the fourth quarter related to a $20.4bn project in Queensland, Australia, which is designed to supply Asian economies with liquefied natural gas.The charges swung BG Group to a pre-tax loss of $2.3bn in 2014, from a profit of $3.9bn the previous year. The company is seeking a 10 per cent cut in headcount expenses this year. Its shares were up almost 1 per cent per cent at 941.2p.Cnooc is to cut capital spending by up to 35 per cent this year — the first such announcement by a Chinese energy group after the fall in crude prices.Cnooc said reduced spending was necessary to “to preserve the company’s health in 2015 and beyond”.Additional reporting by Lucy Hornby in Beijing"
83;COP;Conocophillips;2015-02-02T12:12:06Z;Nine US oil refineries hit by strike in pay dispute;Union stands firm after energy groups look to cut costs in response to falling prices;"Workers have downed tools at nine US oil refineries that account for 10 per cent of domestic capacity in a dispute about pay and conditions.The industrial action entered its second day on Monday after the United Steelworkers Union rejected a fifth contract offer made by Royal Dutch Shell, leading talks on behalf of other oil companies including ExxonMobil and Chevron.The strike, believed to be the first nationwide action organised by the USW since 1980, comes as oil companies respond to a 50 per cent-plus fall in crude prices since last summer by cutting thousands of jobs and billions from their investment plans.The USW is calling for annual pay rises twice as large as those set out in a previous agreement as well as better health cover and a reduction in the use of non-unionised contractors.Tom Conway, USW international vice-president of administration, said: “Oil companies are too greedy to make a positive change in the workplace and they continue to value production and profit over health and safety, workers and the community.“This industry is the richest in the world and can afford to make the changes we offered in bargaining.”The USW represents workers at 65 US oil refineries, and a complete walkout could threaten up to 64 per cent of domestic refining capacity. It said the refineries and oil facilities run by its members were “operating under a rolling 24-hour contract extension”.65Refineries where the USW represents oil workersProduction at the refineries hit by strikes has largely continued, with contingency plans put into operation. However, Tesoro will shut down its Martinez refinery in California.Ray Fisher of Shell said: “We remain committed to resolving our differences with USW at the negotiating table and hope to resume negotiations as early as possible to get our employees back to work.”Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at Energy Aspects, a research consultancy, said: “As this is the first large strike since 1980 there will be considerable uncertainty over the potential duration of the dispute as well as its effects.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further reading“Workers’ demands for more pay and restrictions on the use of contract labour come at a difficult time for many oil companies, with plunging crude prices leading to belt-tightening across the industry which could make achieving an agreement more difficult.”Mr Campbell said an escalation of the strikes could drive up prices of oil products.Gary Beevers, USW international vice-president, criticised the “dangerous conditions the industry continues to ignore”, as well as “the daily occurrences of fires, emissions, leaks and explosions that threaten local communities”.Energy companies have begun disclosing plans to rein in budgets alongside their results, with Shell saying it would “curtail” its capital spending by $15bn over the period to 2017, meaning that 40 projects would be delayed or cancelled.ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, said it planned to cut capital spending by 33 per cent this year, to $11.5bn."
84;COP;Conocophillips;2015-01-30T18:25:32Z;Chevron chief says oil price to rebound after investment cuts;US company trims capital spending in response to low crude price;"Very few large oil projects will go ahead if crude stays below $50 per barrel, setting the scene for a rebound in prices, the chief executive of Chevron of the US has said.Speaking as Chevron became the latest oil company to announce a cut in capital spending in response to the plunge in crude, John Watson said that given fiscal terms and production costs around the world, “I don’t see many investments that are going to go [ahead]” at current prices.He added that in spite of the excitement over booming US shale oil production, “you’re going to see reduction in that rate of growth in response to current prices”.His assessment of the investment outlook reflected the majority view in the industry that oil prices would recover following the steep decline last summer, and with every announcement of capital spending cuts “it’s more likely to happen sooner”.Echoing the views of other leading oil executives, Mr Watson told analysts on a call that the fall-off in new investment, combined with the inevitable decline of output from existing fields and rising global demand, would work to push oil prices higher again.“My basic view is the world needs energy, and the prices have to support the activity,” he said.Oil prices saw a rally on Friday, with US crude futures jumping 8.3 percent to settle at $48.24 a barrel and Brent crude up 7.9 percent to settle at $52.99, its biggest one-day gain since 2009Chevron said on Friday that it planned capital spending of $35bn this year, 13 per cent less than in 2014.The cuts will be focused on Chevron’s upstream oil and gas exploration and production business, particularly outside the US, where investment is planned to fall from $28.3bn last year to $23.4bn this year.Mr Watson said the company was entering 2015 “with the financial strength to meet the challenges of a volatile crude price environment and with significant efforts under way to manage to a lower cost structure”.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingHe also said Chevron expected “growing flexibility” in its spending, as it completed the development of some large projects, and hinted at pressure on suppliers to cut their prices as contracts are renewed.Chevron had already reduced its capital spending from $41.9bn in 2013 to $40.3bn last year, but it is now accelerating the pace of the cuts.Like other large international oil companies that have both upstream production and downstream refining businesses, it is cutting capital spending less sharply than smaller companies that have their oil and gas output as their only source of revenues.Royal Dutch Shell, the largest European oil group, is expected to cut its capital spending this year by $1bn-$2bn from last year’s $35bn, while ConocoPhillips, which spun off its refining and chemicals operations in 2012 to focus on exploration and production, said on Thursday that it planned a 33 per cent cut in spending this year.Almost half of Chevron’s planned upstream spending this year will go to projects that are already under construction and nearing completion, including Gorgon and Wheatstone, the huge liquefied natural gas developments in Australia, and the Big Foot deep water oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico.Mr Watson said he expected these projects would “measurably increase our production and cash generation” when they went on line.He added: “Although commodity prices have fallen recently, we believe long-term market fundamentals remain attractive.”In US oil and gas production the capital spending cuts are expected to be less severe, with a reduction from $8.8bn to $8.2bn, but Mr Watson said Chevron was testing investment decisions on shale and similar resources at present crude prices of about $45 per barrel “and are selecting only the most attractive opportunities to move forward”.Chevron set out its spending plans as it reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 that were above analysts’ expectations, but still 36 per cent lower than in the equivalent period of 2013, at $1.85.The earnings reflected the strength of its downstream businesses, with earnings rising almost fourfold to $1.52bn in the fourth quarter, although some of that increase was due to asset sales in the US.The upstream operations by contrast reported a 45 per cent drop in earnings to $2.67bn.Even last year Chevron’s capital spending outstripped its cash flow from operations, which was just $32bn for 2014. Net debt rose over the year from $4.19bn to $15bn.The company’s oil and gas production averaged 2.57m barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 1 per cent from 2013."
85;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
86;COP;Conocophillips;2015-01-29T19:45:04Z;ConocoPhillips and Shell outline billions of dollars in cuts;Fall in crude prices hits fourth-quarter results for both groups;Two of the world’s largest energy groups, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips, have set out plans for billions of dollars worth of cuts in their investment programmes in response to the plunge in crude prices.The cuts are part of a wave of reductions in capital spending announced by oil companies worldwide as they move to shore up their finances and protect dividends as cash flows are squeezed. The cuts have increased expectations that prices will rebound in the future as supply growth slows.BP has said it will cut 300 staff and contractor jobs from its 3,500-strong North Sea business and freeze salaries across the company in an attempt to cut costs. It has also sold down its equity interests in two massive Gulf of Mexico oilfields and relinquished its position as operator.French major Total announced earlier this month that it planned to reduce group-wide capital spending by 10 per cent this year and speed up billions of dollars in asset disposals.Though Shell and Conoco were both expected to follow suit, they differed sharply in the speed of the responses they announced on Thursday.Shell, the largest European oil group, said it would “curtail” its capital spending by $15bn over 2015-17, representing 40 projects that would be delayed or cancelled.Its spending for this year, however, is set to be only slightly lower than the $35bn it spent in 2014.Conoco, the largest US exploration and production company, said it planned a much steeper 33 per cent cut in its capital spending this year to $11.5bn, $2bn less than it had suggested in its previous guidance issued only last month.Occidental Petroleum, the fourth-largest US oil producer by market capitalisation, also said it would cut this year’s spending by 33 per cent.The companies set out their plans as they reported earnings for the fourth quarter of last year, hit by the steep fall in crude prices since the summer.Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, stressed the company was “taking a prudent approach here”.“We must be careful not to overreact to the recent fall in oil prices,” he said. Over time, he said, supply and demand would come back into balance and prices recover.Royal Dutch Shell is to cut more than $15bn in spending and freeze its dividend in an effort to plug dwindling revenues from oil sales, after the company on Thursday reported a sharp slide in quarterly earnings due to the plunge in crude prices, writes Christopher Adams.Continue readingAs a sign of Shell’s continued commitment to exploring for new oilfields, he pledged to resume drilling in the Arctic, one of the highest cost frontiers. The company plans to drill this summer in the Chukchi Sea north of Alaska.The plan prompted a fierce response from Greenpeace, which said Shell was taking “a massive risk doggedly chasing oil” in the “pristine” Arctic.Mr van Beurden also urged the UK government to cut taxes on revenues from the North Sea, where some fields had become uneconomic: “It needs to be looked at as the tax position is hindering viability.”Excluding exceptional items, Shell’s profits for the fourth quarter of last year were weaker than expected at $3.26bn. But they were 12 per cent higher than a year ago, reflecting the unusually weak fourth quarter of 2013 when the company was forced to issue its first ever profit warning. Its shares fell 4.3 per cent to £20.60 in London on Thursday.Conoco reported a 57 per cent drop in its underlying earnings per share for the fourth quarter to 60 cents, slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations.However Ryan Lance, chief executive, acknowledged that the 2014 results “may seem overshadowed” by the outlook.Plunging crude prices caused a 57 per cent drop in ConocoPhillips’ underlying earnings for the fourth quarter of last year, and pushed the company into a further cut in its capital spending, writes Ed Crooks.Continue readingConoco said the capital spending cut would affect its growth, with production from continuing operations outside Libya likely to rise 2-3 per cent, compared to its target of 3-5 per cent.For 2014 as a whole, Conoco’s cash flow from operations of $16.6bn was exceeded by its capital spending of $17.1bn, meaning that it had to sell assets and borrow more to cover the shortfall and pay its dividend.The fall in oil and gas prices means that its revenues will be squeezed further this year, and Mr Lance implied that capital spending would continue to exceed cash flows for a couple of years. He said Conoco wanted to stay on track for cash flow neutrality in 2017.The company also reiterated its intention “to significantly reduce its unconventional exploration” programmes in new frontier areas for US shale oil.The reluctance to cut spending on big projects too sharply is natural. But it has its downsidesContinue readingConoco said its fourth-quarter loss was $39m against a profit of $2.5bn a year earlier. Its shares nudged up, closing at $62.82 in New York.For Shell, investors and analysts focused on the disappointing fourth-quarter earnings figure. The key miss was in the upstream division, a result of higher taxation and a swing into loss for the group’s US business, which was hurt by the slide in crude.Iain Reid at BMO Capital Markets said that while Shell’s rigorous approach to cost-cutting was bearing fruit, the group “may be saving some of its firepower for later in the year” while it sees what happens to oil prices.Chris Wheaton, analyst and fund manager at Allianz Global Investors, said: “Tapping on the brakes isn’t enough. Shell needs to be clear on just what its baseline targets are.”The company kept its fourth-quarter dividend stable and said it would hold the payout steady for the first quarter of 2015.
87;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Guest post: Venezuela’s Citgo and the revolution’s Praying Mantis School of Business;;"By Russ Dallen of Caracas Capital MarketsInvesting in Venezuela has always been like praying mantis love. On first acquaintance, Bolivarian Venezuela has those big, beautiful Miss Venezuela eyes and those angelic clasped praying hands inspiring trust and confidence, all backed up by glorious profits and yields. But while other investors in Venezuela – from oil companies, to airlines, to consumer products corporations – have been lured to their demise, bondholders have until the past two years been spared from most praying mantis cannibalism, and the action for bondholders has been great! Even if Venezuela has not paid shareholders of ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, or the Koch brothers’ Fertinitro, Venezuela paid the bondholders handsomely! Always! But then came the first sign of trouble, from steel company Sidetur, which the Venezuela government expropriated in 2013 and then didn’t pay its bondholders (or shareholders).Subsequently, over the past year, Venezuela bondholders have finally gotten their heads ripped off. Now the Praying Mantis School of Business is landing on American shores. (For those unacquainted with the sexual cannibalism of the praying mantis, you can watch a two-minute video here.)In July, Citgo, the US refining subsidiary of PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil group, issued $650m in new debt with seemingly strong covenants to protect bondholders. The first hint of doom should have been the identity of the lawyers who wrote Venezuela’s side of the Citgo bond offering memorandum – Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle. George Kahale III, Curtis Mallet’s chairman and former managing partner, is the ace in Venezuela’s arsenal and has been the Bolivarian Republic’s chief defender in its multitude of expropriation cases. The guy is better than good – he is the Red Baron of their legal defence.The bond prospectus seems to have some pretty strong covenants to protect existing lenders and bondholders from just the sort of thing that Citgo is now trying to do:The New Senior Credit Facility will also be governed by a financial covenant providing for an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no more than 60%, to be calculated on a consolidated basis and for each consecutive four fiscal quarter period.

The New Senior Credit Facility will allow us to pay dividends equal to 100% of our cumulative net income (commencing from April 1, 2014 and excluding the aftertax effect of gain on sales of assets) plus net after-tax proceeds from certain permitted assets sales. The New Senior Credit Facility will prohibit us from paying dividends during the existence of an event of default and to the extent payment of dividends would trigger an event of default, and further restrict our payment of dividends by instituting a number of debt incurrence tests, including the following:
• minimum liquidity of $500 million post-dividend; and
• maximum indebtedness to total capitalization of 55% post-dividend.
Incurrence of Indebtedness. The New Senior Credit Facility will allow us to issue the notes offered hereby. In addition, the New Senior Credit Facility will allow us to issue up to $1,000 million in additional secured and unsecured indebtedness, a portion of which indebtedness may be incurred in the form of fixed rate IRBs. To the extent we issue additional secured indebtedness, it may share in the collateral securing the New Senior Credit Facility and the notes offered hereby on a pari passu basis. We currently have $108 million IRBs outstanding. All but $3 million of our outstanding IRBs will be secured on an equal and ratable basis by the collateral securing the notes and the New Senior Credit Facility.”How is Venezuela able to get around these rules, which restrict the ability of PDVSA to dilute Citgo’s credit quality and the ring-fencing which includes a debt/cap maximum of 60 per cent, with a lower 55 per cent test for purposes of making distributions to the parent?Two major moves:1. They are taking PDV America, Inc and changing its name to Citgo Holding, Inc, which will issue the debt above Citgo Petroleum Corporation. Here is the ownership structure before the name change:2. They are taking the terminals (East Chicago, Linden, Albany, Toledo and Dayton) and pipeline assets – which, though mentioned in the prospectus, were not security for the original bondholders – and getting them out from underneath the bondholders by borrowing billions in the name of this new holding company and selling the assets to their own new holding company for $750m as they suck out the money, since they are allowed to repatriate profits from sales of assets.Previously, Venezuela was trying to sell Citgo but that looks to be effectively blocked by ongoing legal actions and threatened legal actions from creditors like ConocoPhillips (no judgment yet, but estimated at $4.5bn), ExxonMobil (has ICSID judgement for $1.7bn) and Gold Reserve (has ICSID judgment for $745m). Texas judge Caroline Baker has not yet ruled on ConocoPhillips Petrozuata’s discovery request on Citgo’s sale, where ConocoPhillips said it would try to prevent the proceeds of a Citgo sale from leaving the country, but the writing was on the wall and buyers are obviously worried about being caught up in years of legal wrangling.So, because they owed so many people, they were unable to sell Citgo, which we had estimated could realize $5bn to $7bn when oil was at $100 a barrel. Instead, they are getting around bondholder and lender protections and sucking the money out of it by forming a new company called Citgo Holdings, Inc above existing bondholders and loading it up with new debt of $2.5bn, with “$1.5 billion as a high yield offering” and a “$1 billion senior secured first lien five-year term loan B.”As of December 31, 2014, Citgo’s total debt was already $1.91bn.In the new structure, Citgo Holding, Inc will own 100 per cent of Citgo as well as the new owner of five oil products terminals, Citgo Holding Terminals, plus two pipeline companies, Southwest Pipeline Holding and Midwest Pipeline Holding. During the last 12 months ended in September 2014, these assets generated just $40m in EBITDA – not even enough to pay half of the interest on the $1bn Term Loan B, much less the interest on a $1.5bn bond!The new Term Loan B and the secured notes will only be guaranteed by the terminal and pipeline companies; Citgo is not a guarantor of the proposed transactions. As Moody’s notes:The security package for the Term Loan B and the notes is weak as it will only include the terminals and pipelines to be acquired from Citgo plus 49% of the capital stock of Citgo.Citgo Holding, Inc will also maintain a reserve account for the benefit of the creditors. The reserve account will be funded on the issue date with funds sufficient to cover one semi-annual interest payment on the debt; the issuer will be obligated to maintain at least such level in the reserve account until the maturity of the loan and the notes. Of course, Sidetur also had such a covenant, and Venezuela defaulted on that in 2013.Citgo is having to offer over 10 per cent on the loan and is still not finding many takers. Current price talk is about 800 basis points over Libor on the five-year senior secured first-lien Term Loan B, according to lead manager Deutsche Bank. There is a Libor floor of 1 per cent – meaning that the interest paid on the principal would be at least 9 per cent – and it will be issued at a discount of 96–97 (ie not 100, par) to bring the yield above 10 per cent. Meanwhile, Venezuela and PDVSA debt is offering yields of as much as 63 per cent in two years and still having trouble finding takers.As is apparent, Venezuela is starved for cash. The country must pay a total of $11bn in US dollar/euro maturities, amortization and interest this year. In February alone, Venezuela, PDVSA and Citgo have to pay over $750m in interest payments on bonds. In March, they have to retire the 1 billion euro Venezuela 7 per cent of 2015.Venezuela’s oil basket averaged $39.52 a barrel this week. According to December’s Opec statistics, Venezuela is producing 2.33m barrels a day, but 800,000 barrels are used in domestic consumption, Cuba gets some free (it was 100,000), China was getting 450,000 barrels a day of their 650,000 in imports as payments toward the $50bn they have already loaned Venezuela. In short, Venezuela only realizes cash from 1.2m to 1.5m barrels a day. At 1.5m bpd at $39.52, it gets $59.3m a day, or $21.6bn for the year. For 1.2m bpd at $39.52, it is just $47m a day, or $17.3bn for the year – barely enough to cover the $11bn in debt, much less pay your oil providers, suppliers and personnel, not to mention imports and everything else.Addendum – Maduro’s dog & pony show
One other thing: like many analysts and masochistic observers, I sat through the five hours of the Dog and Pony Show that was Maduro’s Annual Address to the National Assembly last Wednesday night. I must say that I had a moment of positive thought when the cameras showed banners of Maduro with China’s Xi Jinping – Maduro had promised to reveal all the details of all the money he had gotten on his Beg, Borrow or Steal Tour, so I thought “Oh, maybe he really did get the $20bn from China or maybe even the billions from the Qataris and he is going finally tell us about it! Wow!” So, what did Maduro say about the so-called billions he said he had gotten on his tour from China and Qatar? Nothing. Crickets. He said nothing at all. Almost like it had never really happened.

88;COP;Conocophillips;2015-01-29T13:43:46Z;ConocoPhillips’ earnings fall 57% amid oil rout;Largest US oil and gas company makes further cut to capital spending to preserve dividend;Plunging crude prices caused a 57 per cent drop in ConocoPhillips’ underlying earnings for the fourth quarter of last year, and pushed the company into a further cut in its capital spending.Conoco, which is the largest US oil and gas exploration and production company, also warned on Thursday that its production growth this year would slow to 2-3 per cent, below its 3-5 per cent objective, which it had said in October it still aimed to hit.It now expects capital spending on finding and developing oil and gas reserves to drop to $11.5bn this year — compared with its previous plan of $13.5bn set out in December — and expenditure of $17.1bn last year.Ryan Lance, chief executive, said: “We are responding decisively to a weak price outlook in 2015 by exercising our capital and balance sheet flexibility.”He added that Conoco’s priorities were to protect the company’s dividend and production, while aiming to cover capital spending with cash flows in 2017, and continuing to line up opportunities for future growth.Already last year Conoco’s capital spending exceeded its cash from operations, which totalled $16.6bn.Over 2014 as a whole Conoco’s selling price averaged $64.59 per barrel of oil equivalent. This reflected a mix of higher-priced oil and lower-priced natural gas, but by the fourth quarter the selling price had dropped to $52.88 per barrel. Oil and gas prices have both fallen further since then.The company still thinks it can increase its output, but by only 2-3 per cent this year for continuing operations excluding its troubled Libyan business, which has been affected by the conflict in that country.Fourth-quarter earnings per share were slightly above expectations at 60 cents, compared with an average analysts’ forecast of 58 cents.The company also had a good year in 2014 for exploration, adding 700m barrels of oil equivalent to its reserves to take them to 8.9bn barrels. It also delivered 35 per cent growth from its US shale oil operations in the Eagle Ford of south Texas and the Bakken of North Dakota.Mr Lance said: ““While 2014 results may seem overshadowed by the current environment, it is important to recognise that in 2014 we delivered on our strategic plan.”The company also took a $545m charge on its decision to pull out of a Freeport liquefied natural gas plant, which it expects to save money in the long run.
89;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BP scales back on two Gulf of Mexico fields;UK energy group takes steps to pare back its balance sheet;"BP has scaled back its role in two oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico, handing US-based Chevron a big stake in the development of about 1bn barrels of crude in a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars.The UK-based energy major on Wednesday took a substantial step towards its target of selling $10bn of assets by the end of this year, selling half its equity interests in the Gila and Tiber fields, two huge deepwater discoveries found in the past decade, and relinquishing its position as operator.The disposal is the latest step by BP, which has sold more than $43bn of assets since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, to pare back its balance sheet and slash costs.The company declined to put a value on the deal or disclose any expected cost savings, but analysts said it was likely to receive hundreds of millions of dollars, including a cash payment for costs already incurred.BP’s decision is significant because it will not take a lead role as operator in what are some of the most important discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years and a geological layer, the Paleogene trend, seen as the most promising area for the region’s future development.The Tiber exploration well, the deepest commercial oil well at the time, was drilled by Transocean’s Deepwater Horizon rig, which exploded and sank in the Macondo disaster seven months later in April 2010.Under the agreement, BP and Chevron will each hold 31 per cent of equity in Tiber, Brazil’s Petrobras 20 per cent and ConocoPhillips, another US major, 18 per cent.BP, Chevron and Conoco have agreed to joint ownership interests in the Gila field and also exploration blocks east of Gila known as Gibson, where they plan to drill in 2015. The three will have the same working interests across Gila and Gibson. Chevron will hold equity of 36 per cent, BP 34 per cent and Conoco 30 per cent.News and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingBP said that combining the resources of the companies would “provide greater efficiency through scale, reduce subsurface risk and increase the likelihood of achieving a future commercial development”.The deal also brings its stake more into line with typical “working interest” stakes in other big deepwater projects. By bringing in Chevron, BP has secured the involvement of one of only a few proven developers of Paleogene projects, characterised by the huge technical challenges of drilling several miles through rock below the seabed.“Completing these agreements will enable BP to do three things that are at the core of our strategy in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,” said Richard Morrison, president of BP’s Gulf of Mexico business.“It will support continued exploration and development in the Paleogene, which we expect to be a key part of our future in the region. It will [also] allow us to manage and maintain capital discipline by sharing development costs.”Shares in BP closed down 1.7 per cent at 431.9p in London."
90;COP;Conocophillips;2015-01-25T20:42:42Z;Obama challenges Congress on Arctic oil;Attempt to protect 12m acres of wilderness opens new battle line with Republicans and industry;"US President Barack Obama has called on Congress to designate more than 12m acres of Alaska’s arctic wilds for environmental protection, opening another battle line with Republicans and the oil industry.In statements released on Sunday the Obama administration said it would ask Congress to give 12.29m acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska the official label of “wilderness”, effectively putting an area where drilling is already banned off limits indefinitely.The move, which would require the approval of a Republican-led Congress, would more than double the current 7m acres of the refuge now given the highest environmental designation possible for US public lands. It would be the largest wilderness designation enacted by Congress, the US Department of the Interior said.Crucially, the president said he wanted the wilderness designation given to 1.5m acres of the refuge’s coastal plains, an area that previous US government studies have said contains more than 10bn barrels of recoverable oil that the industry is eager to exploit.In a video featuring polar bears and other wildlife released as part of the announcement Mr Obama described the Alaskan refuge as an “incredible place”.He said he would ask Congress to designate it for wilderness protection “so that we can make sure that this amazing wonder is preserved for future generations”.“Designating vast areas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness reflects the significance this landscape holds for America and its wildlife,” said secretary of the interior Sally Jewell. “Just like Yosemite or the Grand Canyon, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of our nation’s crown jewels and we have an obligation to preserve this spectacular place for generations to come.”But the move quickly drew an angry response from Republicans and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, the new Republican chairwoman of the Senate’s energy and natural resources committee.The announcement amounted to “a stunning attack on our sovereignty” and a betrayal of Alaskans who wanted to have the freedom to exploit the state’s natural resources safely, she said.“It’s clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory. The promises made to us at statehood, and since then, mean absolutely nothing to them. I cannot understand why this administration is willing to negotiate with Iran, but not Alaska,” Ms Murkowski said in a statement.The latest news and analysis on the world’s changing climate and the political moves afoot to tackle the problem

Further readingMs Murkowski said it was unclear whether the new restrictions would affect areas already under lease by Shell, ConocoPhillips and Statoil.“We will fight back with every resource at our disposal,” she said.Sunday’s announcement came alongside the release of a “comprehensive plan” for management of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by the interior department. It would be open for public review for 30 days before the president would submit his request for the wilderness designation to Congress."
91;COP;Conocophillips;2015-01-22T17:47:53Z;Impact of oil price rout starkly evident in North America;Saudi Arabia strategy hits shale where it hurts but the industry can be expected to take the pain;In the trial of strength in global oil markets, it is the North American producers that are flinching first.The fall in the internationally traded crude price of more than 55 per cent since last June has put oil-producing companies and countries everywhere under pressure.In the past week, though, there has been a clear message in results from Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, the three largest international service companies that support oil and gas producers with activities such as drilling, completing and analysing wells. All three say activity is dropping off much more sharply in North America than in the rest of the world.The oil price has been falling so fast that forecasting is difficult. As Paal Kibsgaard, Schlumberger’s chief executive, put it on the call with analysts to discuss the company’s fourth-quarter results last Friday: “We have a very significant lack of visibility. The way we are going about managing . . . is quarter by quarter now.”The oil majors begin reporting fourth-quarter results next week, starting with Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips, and are expected to give substantive updates on how they are responding to the fall by cutting capital expenditure. However, initial indications are that spending by Schlumberger’s customers, which include both the majors and smaller companies, is dropping by 25-30 per in North America compared with 10-15 per cent in the rest of the world.The message was similar from Halliburton on Tuesday. Dave Lesar, its chief executive, talked about a 25-30 per cent fall in the US and predicted a period of “volatility and pain for a few quarters”.By contrast, he said, the Middle East and Asia appeared the company’s “most resilient” markets and were expected to be its best performers this year.A critical issue for the future of the US shale industry is how far it can drive down costs to improve cash flow and profitabilitySee belowBaker Hughes, which last November accepted a $27.9bn takeover bid from Halliburton, also said it was seeing the sharpest slowdown in the US and Canada. Martin Craighead, chief executive, said that in past downturns the number of oil rigs working in North America had fallen by 40-60 per cent in the first 12 months. Numbers in the rest of the world “don’t tend to fall as sharply”.Data published by Baker Hughes show a 15 per cent drop in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the US from October to January. But there was a drop of just one oil rig in Saudi Arabia, from 67 in October to 66 in December.A survey of oil companies’ capital spending intentions published by Barclays earlier this month painted a similar picture.State-controlled national oil companies planned to cut by an average of just 1 per cent, it found, with spending rising in the Middle East. Budgets for North America were expected to be cut by 14.1 per cent, but the survey was conducted last month on the basis of a $65 per barrel price for US crude this year. If the price stays below $50, Barclays said, the drop in spending was likely to be 30 per cent or more.The faster downturn in the North American industry is in part explained by the higher costs of US and Canadian shale production compared with oil from the Middle East. The median North American shale development last year needed a US crude price of $57 a barrel to break even, according to IHS, the research company. The price now is below $48.Other oil regions, including Canada’s oil sands and Brazil’s deep water, also have high costs, but there are particular features of US shale that mean it reacts faster.First, the individual investments are small, making it more flexible. A typical well in the Bakken shale of North Dakota might cost $8m, compared with multiple billions for a project in deep water or the oil sands, meaning that spending can be ramped up and down more quickly.Second, the small and medium-sized companies that have led the US shale boom have been running large cash deficits and relying on constant inflows of debt and equity capital to finance their spending. Their share prices have fallen sharply and raising fresh capital is much tougher than it was a year ago.Third, the production decline rates for shale wells are much steeper than for conventional oil: daily output can fall 65 per cent in the first year. A typical Bakken well in its first year will produce more than half the oil it will ever yield. So if you believe prices are going to rebound, it makes sense to wait.As Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of Total, put it in Davos on Wednesday: “I can come back in one year when prices come back.”Because of those steep decline rates, US oil production is expected to respond within months to the slowdown in drilling.Mr Kibsgaard of Schlumberger says the “strong growth momentum” in the US industry means the general expectation is for a slowdown in growth and a levelling off in production rather than an absolute decline.So long as global demand continues to grow, though, that could be enough to drive a recovery in crude prices. If that happens, many analysts expect the US shale industry to rebound as well.“The Saudis are realistic: they know they can’t kill the US shale oil industry,” says David Goldwyn, a former US state department official who is now an energy consultant. “Low prices might slow its growth for a while, but as soon as prices recover, the US industry will come back.”Push for savings drives job cuts in US sectorA critical issue for the future of the US shale industry is how far it can drive down costs to improve cash flow and profitability, writes Ed Crooks in New York.This push for savings goes a long way to explaining why oil services companies are starting to cut thousands of jobs.Paal Kibsgaard, Schlumberger’s chief executive, said the company was already seeing “pricing pressures” in North America for the hydraulic fracturing — or “fracking” — and drilling services used by the shale industry.“We are actively working with our customers in all basins to help lower their overall drilling and completion costs,” he said.Martin Craighead, chief executive of Baker Hughes, said it had already started “serious discussions” with customers about the prices of pressure pumping services used for fracking.He added the company expected a “double hit” from lower activity and lower prices.Baker Hughes plans to cut 7,000 jobs — or 12 per cent of its workforce — and Schlumberger 9,000, while Halliburton said it was making reductions “in line” with its competitors, without giving a number.However, the companies are suggesting there are limits to how far their prices can fall.Dave Lesar, chief executive of Halliburton, pictured, said he expected pricing concessions to be “less severe” than in previous cycles, because the upturn had not lasted long enough for profit margins to reach historically strong levels.It would take a couple of quarters, he suggested, for the balance of slowing activity and falling prices to play out, and for the market to reach “some sort of equilibrium”.Back to the top of the page
92;COP;Conocophillips;2015-01-15T18:16:46Z;UK orders urgent review into North Sea oil;Energy secretary Davey acts after BP announces job losses;UK ministers have ordered an urgent review into the state of the North Sea oil industry, after a collapse in prices that has prompted BP and other companies to cut hundreds of jobs and raised fears operators could speed up the decommissioning of ageing fields.Ed Davey, energy secretary, asked Andy Samuel, chief executive designate of the new Oil and Gas Authority, “to lead an urgent commission, working with industry, to identify the key risks to oil and gas production” on the UK continental shelf.Mr Samuel’s review would “identify what further measures might be taken by government and industry to mitigate them,” the government said.Mr Davey said he wanted the new regulator to come up with “practical measures to mitigate the immediate risks that the downturn in prices presents us with.”The review’s early findings are expected by the end of February, before the Budget. It came after BP told staff in Aberdeen on Thursday that it was cutting 300 jobs in its North Sea business, under a wide-ranging cost-reduction plan announced in December. The UK-based oil major blamed “toughening market conditions”.The company outlined plans to cut 200 directly employed onshore staff and 100 contractors over the course of 2015, from a 3,500-strong North Sea business.Senior oil industry executives on Thursday appealed directly to Mr Davey for swingeing tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget to ease the effect of a more than 50 per cent slide in oil prices and secure a long-term future for North Sea production.Sir Ian Wood, the veteran Aberdeen-based oil billionaire who led last year’s government-commissioned review into the industry, told the Financial Times that there should be at least a 10 per cent cut in the supplementary charge that is levied on top of corporation tax.“The worst thing that can happen is irreversible damage, if we lose resources, operators and presence and can’t get the industry back up and running again,” he said. A sizeable tax cut would “give the operators a light in the end of the tunnel”.His comments came amid growing speculation in the industry that big operators including ConocoPhillips could soon bring forward plans to decommission some ageing fields, with the slide in crude prices now rendering these uneconomic.The government is already consulting on proposals to simplify the fiscal regime with a “basin-wide” investment allowance and decommissioning relief. Mr Davey said in an interview with the FT before his visit: “I’ve been engaged on tax reform in the past, the Treasury has responded positively. Let us see what happens now.”George Osborne’s top adviser Rupert Harrison long ago gave up lobbying this columnist to write rosily about his boss’s policies. But should he seek to renew the acquaintance, Lombard would lobby straight back at him, asking the Treasury to cut the levy on North Sea oil by a grown-up amount, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingTrevor Garlick, regional president for BP’s North Sea arm, said: “We are committed to the North Sea and see a long-term future for our business here. However, given the well-documented challenges of operating in this maturing region and in toughening market conditions, we are taking specific steps to ensure our business remains competitive and robust, and we are aligning with the wider industry.”“Whilst our primary focus will be on improving efficiencies and on simplifying the way we work, an inevitable outcome of this will be an impact on headcount . . . We have spoken to staff and will work with those affected over the coming months.”But union leaders accused the oil companies and government of failing to prepare for falling oil prices. Unite said the job cuts were “part of a deeply worrying trend across an industry which is central to the Scottish and wider UK economy.”BP is midway through an investment phase in the North Sea, pressing ahead with two major projects — Clair Ridge and Schiehallion — that are expected to come on stream in the next couple of years.However, the company’s divestment programme has also significantly affected its presence in the region, with the group pulling out of much of its southern North Sea gas business and assets that it does not operate. It has also decided to cut the wages of 450 self-employed oil and gas workers in the region by up to 15 per cent.The group announced last month it would incur a charge of about $1bn over five quarters as it sheds backroom staff and layers of management no longer needed to run a pared-back global business. Since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, BP has sold more than $43bn of assets including more than half its pipelines, 35 per cent of its wells and 12 per cent of its reserves.Billions of dollars of spending on oil and petrochemicals projects has been scrapped or put on hold, with Royal Dutch Shell and UK-based Premier Oil announcing the first big cost-cutting moves of 2015 after a brutal slide in crude prices. Continue readingProduction, excluding Russia, has fallen nearly 30 per cent since 2009, while upstream headcount has risen 13 per cent, in part to address safety issues.But with the tumble in the oil price accelerating industry efforts to tackle soaring cost inflation after an extended period of $100-plus crude prices, BP is not alone in shedding assets and cutting expenditure, particularly in the North Sea.Premier Oil said on Wednesday it had cut rates of pay for contractors and other freelance workers engaged in projects in the North Sea and was attempting to renegotiate deals with suppliers to trim operating costs.ConocoPhillips, the US major, announced in December it would cut up to 230 jobs in its North Sea operations after completing a review of its business.One of the biggest producers in the region, in terms of output, Conoco is cutting capital spending across its global operations by 20 per cent this year. Other big energy groups including Royal Dutch Shell and Total are also expected to announce cuts to their expenditure plans for the coming year when they report fourth-quarter results in the coming weeks. The majors are determined to shore up cash flow to protect dividends.Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy, said in an analysis this week that upstream investment in the UK continued to boom in 2014, with $19bn of capital spending pumped into the sector, helping to stabilise production. But it added that rising costs, poor exploration results and falling prices had raised concerns for this year.Wood Mac estimated that $3.2bn of spending linked to projects yet to win development approval could be at risk over the next two years. Without that, UK upstream spending in 2016 would fall to about $10bn, just over half 2014 levels. Exploration and appraisal activity on the UK continental shelf continued to fall last year, with the number of exploration wells declining 18 per cent to just 23.***Price fall hits SNP forecastPlunging oil prices would have thrown the finances of an independent Scotland into disarray, with revenues just a 20th of the level implied by nationalists’ preferred forecasts, according to UK government analysis, writes Emily Cadman.Brent crude has nearly halved from $97 a barrel on the day of the independence referendum to under $50 today.The Scottish National party’s preferred forecast, which predicted that an independent Scotland would receive £20.2bn in revenues between 2016-17 and 2018-19, was based on prices of $110 a barrel.The Scotland Office — the UK central government department responsible for Scotland — estimates that if prices remained at current levels, an independent Scotland would have been on track to raise just £1bn over this period and would be facing a £19.2bn gap in public finances.Offshore oil and gas receipts are notoriously volatile, and since devolution Scotland’s share has fluctuated between £2bn and £12.5bn a year.Speaking on Wednesday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney stressed that falling prices would be a net positive for the overall UK economy.“While it’s a negative shock to the Scottish economy, that can be substantially mitigated by the fiscal arrangements that exist within the UK” he told MPs.
93;COP;Conocophillips;2014-12-22T12:17:11Z;Seplat and Afren in talks over oil merger;A deal would create a £1.8bn Nigeria-focused energy group;"Seplat, the Nigerian oil group that listed its shares in London this year, is in talks with rival Afren over the first major merger in Africa’s energy industry since oil prices began their collapse this summer.Afren said on Monday that it had “received a highly preliminary approach” from Seplat “regarding a possible combination”. Based on Seplat’s current enterprise value of £730m, and Afren’s £1.1bn, a combined entity would have a valuation of about £1.8bn ($2.8bn).Afren shares surged nearly 15 per cent after the announcement — although they are still down 66 per cent since January, following a series of scandals involving unauthorised payments and the sacking of its chief executive.The company warned that there was “no certainty that an offer will be made or as to the terms of any offer”. Seplat made no immediate comment, but people familiar with the Nigerian group highlighted the talks between both companies were “very, very preliminary” and the chances of a deal relatively thin.A Seplat-Afren deal, if realised, has the potential to begin a round of consolidation among Nigeria’s nascent homegrown oil companies, which have expanded exponentially in the past five years by buying up assets from the supermajors. Big Oil has been keen to reduce its onshore presence in Nigeria, after ownership disputes, sabotage and long delays to a new law setting out terms for operators.Royal Dutch Shell, Total of France, Eni of Italy and Chevron and ConocoPhillips of the US are among the companies that have sold billions of dollars worth of oilfields and pipelines since 2008-09. Nigerian oil companies such as Oando and Shoreline Natural Resources, as well as Seplat and Afren, have been among the buyers, supported with debt from local and international banks.Seplat is sitting on a large cash pile after raising $500m from its initial public offerings in London and Lagos in April — and its failure to buy any further assets in Nigeria. Seplat could provide Afren with much needed cash to finance the rehabilitation of oilfields and improved governance after a series of scandals. But Afren’s top shareholders, which include Standard Life and BlackRock, are not likely to support any deal at current valuations.ABC Orjiako, chairman of Seplat, told the Financial Times earlier this year that, after the purchases and a round of IPOs, the next stage in the development of Nigeria’s oil industry would be consolidation. “We are not far from the first wave of M&A; we will see it in the next two years,” he said in an interview in May.Oil bankers believe that Nigerian groups will come under more pressure to consolidate as the drop in oil prices stretches their finances.

The Nasdaq Composite index was 2.1 per cent higher at 4,644.31."
95;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oil’s decline poses a pricing challenge for managers;Too few companies know how to brace themselves for commodity turbulence;"“Trying to forecast oil demand, supply and price in today’s market is like trying to paint the wings of an aeroplane in flight. Even if one succeeds in covering the subject, it’s unlikely to be a tidy job.”Howard Kauffmann, then president of Exxon, was speaking in 1982, as the price of crude declined from its post-oil-shock high, but his comments may as well apply today, with prices weak and pundits who warned of “peak oil” a year or two ago fretting instead about “peak demand”.Oil majors are price takers: the level at which they sell their product is largely dictated by the market. Not surprisingly, when the price falls, they have to adjust other costs. BP last week heralded big cuts and job losses; ConocoPhillips said it would reduce capital spending by a fifth in 2015.But what about the price makers, the companies for whom oil is one of many raw materials for their product? Their management challenge is more complex.Despite the efforts of economists to boil the pricing question down to essentials (Alfred Marshall famously used a fish market to illustrate “perfect” competition), and centuries of experience, even large companies sometimes seem to flounder.One reason is that organisations flout the Kauffmann Principle by switching to autopilot and ignoring any risk of turbulence ahead. After a long period of commodity stability in the 1990s, some managers simply forgot how to adjust the paint-pots in flight, according to one former executive at a multinational. They had lapsed into a complacent view that the cost of commodities was predictable, projected prices accordingly, and duly suffered when raw material prices misbehaved.The textbook answer to the question of how to smooth commodity volatility is to hedge. But hedging can be a dangerous game if it is not your core activity. In 2012, Delta Air Lines actually bought a refinery near Philadelphia as part of its effort to manage fuel prices. The decision perplexed analysts, one of whom said it was “like a rabbi buying a church”. Glory be, Delta said last week that, partly as a result of its unorthodox strategy, it expected lower fuel prices to yield an annual net cost benefit of $1.7bn. But some critics still believe the refinery gambit — launched when oil was costly — will not work as well now crude prices are weakening.At least Delta is trying. Francesco Barosi of AlixPartners, the consultancy, says most companies “instead of looking ahead, are looking back”. Very few are good at both tactical pricing, which depends on managing existing contracts and orders, and strategic pricing, which involves keeping an eye on the horizon. Most ignore even valuable internal information from customers and suppliers that could allow them to anticipate volatility and be less reactive.Knowledge of the consequences of a shift in raw material costs remains patchy. Some companies examine only the potential impact on their top three products; some look at their whole portfolio; some remain in the dark. Recession and online competition have pushed pricing to the top of the board’s agenda at retail businesses, according to one chief financial officer. But AlixPartners reckons fewer than half
of companies put price analysis and negotiation in the hands of a dedicated senior team.Such lapses are surprising, given that pricing the product properly is one of the basic imperatives of business. One of the great pleasures of watching The Apprentice is seeing how novices mess it up. In one recent episode of the UK version, the teams competed to create candles (which in their commercial form depend, as it happens, on paraffin wax, an oil byproduct). To call their pricing strategies naive would be a gross understatement. In the end, the candidates with the better product were trounced because their opponents, despite having made various moronic errors, had used cheaper ingredients and sold their candles at a higher margin.Some manufacturers will get lucky as the cost of crude oil falls. They may be able to hold prices and bank a higher margin. Congratulations if that decision was thought through. If, however, you did not know, let alone anticipate, how that windfall occurred, you deserve to be ranked with the blunderers on The Apprentice: you are neither price taker, nor price maker, but a price faker, whose bluff will eventually, and expensively, get called.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill"
96;COP;Conocophillips;2014-12-11T22:44:00Z;Delta aims for $1.7bn fuel price boost;Falling costs are helping fortunes of big US carriers;Delta Air Lines expects lower fuel prices to produce an annual net cost benefit of $1.7bn, the company said on Thursday, in the latest sign of how falling fuel costs are boosting the fortunes of big US carriers.Delta gave the estimate at an investor day in New York at which the company also said it expected pre-tax profit of $4.5bn in 2014, up $1.9bn compared to last year.The company’s shares surged almost 5 per cent on the announcements, to $48.38.Delta has taken an unusual approach to managing fuel prices by purchasing the Trainer oil refinery near Philadelphia.Delta has also persevered with significantly older — and hence more fuel-hungry — aircraft than other US airlines, betting that it can maintain the passenger jets better than competitors and therefore save on capital spending.Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer, claimed both strategies were proving successful. The refinery — which has lost money heavily during periods after Delta bought it from ConocoPhillips in 2012 — was expected to contribute $70m to operating profit in the fourth quarter, and the company was successfully managing expenses.“I think we’re on a strong path,” Mr Jacobson said. “We’ve created a lot of value. We have a lot more value to create.”Delta and other US airlines have enjoyed sharply rebounding profitability in recent years as a series of mergers has reduced cut-throat competition, and the US economic recovery has encouraged travel.Delta said its cost per available seat mile excluding fuel expenses would rise by only 1 per cent for the last three months of 2014 compared with the fourth quarter last year.“The cost performance has been a really terrific performance over the last couple of years,” Mr Jacobson said.I think we’re on a strong path. We’ve created a lot of value. We have a lot more value to createHowever, Delta would increase its overall seating capacity by about 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year.“We’re not so focused on cost discipline that we miss out on investing in the product,” Mr Jacobson said.The US airline industry still had considerable opportunities to improve its profitability given recent consolidation, he added.“We talk a lot about still being in the relative infancy of consolidation, learning to be comfortable in our own skin, learning to appreciate the economies of scale that this industry has never seen before,” Mr Jacobson said.Delta estimated that its distinctive fuel strategy should gain it an 8c to 10c per gallon advantage over competitors. It expected to pay an average $2.88 per gallon this year, against $2.97 for the wider industry.

The S&P 500 energy index has fallen 19 per cent over the past three months, reflecting a steady slide in crude prices.An unexpected drop in Chinese oil imports stoked fears that global demand for oil may be shrinking, after Opec decided not to cut production despite higher than expected supplies.ConocoPhillips, one of the three largest oil companies in the US, announced it would cut its 2015 capital budget by 20 per cent compared with this year.The Houston-based oil and gas producer said about $4.8bn would be spent on “major projects”, many of which are nearing completion, which is a “significant reduction” compared with 2014. It will defer investments on less developed projects in Canada, Texas, and the Niobrara shale field, the company said.“We are setting our 2015 capital budget at a level that we believe is prudent given the current environment,” said Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive.The steep drop in crude prices has pushed several oil producers to trim budgets and cut back on projects for 2015. ConocoPhillips’ cut of about $3bn is one of the largest by a US oil company, in dollar terms.The $13.5bn budget is “well below our expectations of $15bn”, Simmons & Co analysts wrote in a note.ConocoPhillips shares closed down 4.14 per cent at $65.04 on Monday.Apart from the largest US oil producers, small-cap energy stocks were also hit by crude concerns. Goodrich Petroleum, an oil and gas producer based in Louisiana, dropped more than 20 per cent to $2.96, and has fallen more than 80 per cent this year.Halcon Resources, a Houston producer, was another one of the worst-performing stocks on the US benchmark, falling more than 10 per cent to $1.57.Precision Drilling slipped more than 7 per cent to $5.54, down more than 40 per cent this year, and Sanchez Energy fell more than 19 per cent to $7, building on a drop of 69 per cent on the year. Energy XXI fell 14.63 per cent to $2.80.While the oil sector was gloomy, US biotech stocks outperformed on Monday.The S&P 500 biotechnology index rose 2.4 per cent at one stage, with shares in Amgen Inc, a California-based pharmaceutical company, boosted by a decision from the top US patent appeals court to uphold its dismissal of a lawsuit from Sandoz Inc.Sandoz had sought to shield its planned version of Amgen’s psoriasis and arthritis drug Enbrel from patent lawsuits. Amgen rose 1.42 per cent to $171.64.Canadian oil sands producers fell alongside US energy companies, pulling the Toronto Stock Exchange down more than 2 per cent.MEG Energy was the biggest loser on the TSX, dropping more than 15 per cent after it cut capital spending for this year by a third last week. Lightstream Resources, a Calgary oil producer, fell 16.49 per cent.US equities were little changed earlier on Monday, as investors digested Friday’s upbeat jobs report and awaited a Federal Reserve policy meeting next week, but dipped by the close.The S&P 500 fell 0.73 per cent to 2,060.31, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.59 per cent to 17,852.48, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was off 0.84 per cent at 4,740.69.
98;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Renewed pressure on crude oil prices weighs on US energy groups;S&P 400 index of oil and gas equipment and services falls 4.1%;Renewed pressure on crude oil prices on Monday weighed heavily on the shares and bonds sold by US energy companies.Debt sold by energy companies is among the worst performing assets within the $1.3tn US high-yield market this year. The group, which accounts for close to 15 per cent of the junk bond market, has experienced pronounced selling as falling oil prices have raised doubts about the ability of smaller oil and shale gas companies to service their debt obligations.Further declines in oil prices are seen hitting equity and bond prices and forcing the delay or cancellation of pending or new debt sales by energy companies.“The high-yield market has been hijacked by the gyrations in the oil markets,” said Adrian Miller, director of fixed-income strategy at GMP Securities. “The drop in oil prices hits energy bonds and stocks and is dampening sentiment on broad markets.”Equity groups representing small and medium-sized oil and gas equipment and services companies hit new lows for the year on Monday as WTI, the US crude oil benchmark, briefly dropped below $63 a barrel, its lowest since June 2009. Crude was trading above $100 during the summer.The S&P 400 index of oil and gas equipment and services fell 4.1 per cent, while the S&P 600 sector fell 6.2 per cent at the close of Wall Street’s trading on Monday.Also under pressure were the larger, so-called oil majors including Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips.Investors are worried that while the more than 40 per cent decline in oil prices since June has been pinned on a glut of supply, there are signs that it may also reflect an ebbing in demand. Chinese trade data disappointed markets at the start of the week and also weighed on oil prices.Shares in Exxon were trading 2.2 per cent lower by the close, while Chevron fell 3.6 per cent and ConocoPhillips declined 4.1 per cent.“The large US oil companies are diversified and can withstand for some time a shock in oil prices,” said Mr Miller. “But that doesn’t mean they too will not cut back in investments and dividends.”For the US high-yield bond market, the gloomy sentiment has weighed on the appetite for debt issuance from energy companies and resulted in borrowers delaying new deals. Last week, banks working on a loan for C&J Energy Services, a hydraulic fracturing company, postponed the deal, citing “market conditions”, according to S&P LCD.Analysts at Citi said in research that while some high-yield energy bonds have been trading more than 50 points lower over the past several months, “in at least some cases fundamentals haven’t deteriorated to the same extent, in our view”.The bank added: “Our equity analysts believe that more mergers and acquisitions will occur in the period ahead as stronger companies look to buy weaker ones on the cheap, which could be a good thing for credit investors since so many issues trade well below par.”
99;COP;Conocophillips;2014-12-08T17:19:31Z;Conoco slashes investment after oil slump;Top three US producer cuts spending by a fifth;ConocoPhillips has become the first major oil and gas company to detail cuts to its capital spending plans following the steep fall in crude prices since June, by revealing that it will spend about 20 per cent less next year than in 2014.On Monday, the company said that it planned to slow its activity in US shale oil and gas exploration, as well as completing some large projects that had pushed its spending higher in recent years.It will defer work in several of the newer emerging areas for shale development in North America, including the Permian Basin of west Texas, the Niobrara shale of Colorado, and the Montney and Duvernay formations in western Canada.Conoco had previously projected that its average capital spend would be about $16bn per year through to 2017. But it now plans a capex budget of just $13.5bn for 2015, after indicating in October that it planned a cut.Analysts at Simmons said the revised spending plan was “well below” their expectation of a $15bn capital budget for next year.Paul Sankey, an analyst at Wolfe Research, praised Conoco’s decision to make an “aggressive” cut to capital spending and to be committed to its dividend.He added that he expected “a wave” of capital spending announcements over the next two weeks, and more in January, with other companies likely to move closer to Conoco’s 20 per cent reduction.However, he added: “This company still leads the way in facing the next century in oil.”Conoco executives said they still expected to achieve their earlier forecast of 3 per cent production growth next year.Ryan Lance, chief executive, argued that the new 2015 budget was “prudent given the current environment.”He said the company was focused on covering its expenditure from its operating cash flows and maintaining a “competitive” dividend. At present, the company pays out more of its earnings in dividends than many of its peers among exploration and production companies, and offers a higher dividend yield at about 4.5 per cent.Conoco shares fell 3.4 per cent in Monday morning trading to $65.58, in line with the falls in other similar oil and gas companies as the crude price continued to decline. They extended the loss, closing down 4.14 per cent to $65.04.US shale explorers have been thrown into the spotlight as a result of the fall in oil prices, because their costs are higher than for many other conventional crude oil producers worldwide, and because capital spending on production can be stepped up and down relatively quickly.Conoco said it planned to cut its budget for development drilling, which includes its shale operations, by 23 per cent next year to $5bn.It will concentrate its spending in the Bakken shale of North Dakota and the Eagle Ford of south Texas, which are the best-established regions in the US for shale oil development, while slowing down in other regions.But the company said it retained “flexibility to ramp up or down activity” in shale, suggesting it could respond quickly to either a recovery or a further drop in crude prices, which have fallen more than 40 per cent since June.Conoco also said it planned a “slight reduction” in its capital spending on maintenance at its fields in production, and said exploration drilling would be “down slightly” compared to this year.Exploration efforts will be focused on offshore oil and gas in the US Gulf of Mexico, west Africa and Nova Scotia, and North American onshore “unconventional” resources, including shale and similar reserves.Two large projects that are now nearing completion, where Conoco expects to spend less next year, are its APLNG liquefied natural gas export project in eastern Australia, and Surmont Phase 2, an oil sands development in Canada.
100;COP;Conocophillips;2014-11-16T14:01:39Z;Poland’s shale gas dreams put on hold;Global petrochemical groups complain of red tape and disappointing results;"Poland’s much-hyped shale gas boom could take as long as six more years to become commercially viable, as foreign oil and gas companies abandon their exploratory plans, citing bureaucratic tangles and an unfriendly investment climate.Poland dreamt of domestic shale gas providing both an alternative to relying on politically unpalatable Russian energy and a windfall to state tax coffers.Global petrochemical companies such as ExxonMobil, Total and ConocoPhillips flocked to the country, snapping up concessions and making Poland Europe’s biggest shale gas market by drilled wells.But instead exploratory wells have failed to meet expectations and many drillers have grown impatient with regulatory delays that executives say have smothered their ambition.Of the 11 foreign companies that invested in the country’s shale gas market over the past four years, seven have abandoned the market, after spending a cumulative £500m.That has left domestic, state-backed companies such as PKN Orlen, Lotos and PGNiG with the financial and regulatory backing of the government, and a handful of well-funded global players, to wait for a change in fortunes.“We gave it our best shot. We got to a point where we could not justify carrying on. We demonstrated some potential, but our company could not justify committing further capital based on the results so far,” says Kamlesh Parmar, chief executive of British driller 3Legs Resources, which pulled out of Poland in September.“It is going to take longer and cost more money than most people imagine. Those operators that continue will have to have the funding and patience to give their projects the best chances of success.”The steady withdrawal of investors and explorers and rising disillusion with Poland’s shale gas prospects is not likely to be helped by the recent sharp fall in global oil prices, which have cast doubt on the financial credibility of the fuel even in well-established drilling markets such as the US.The country’s environment ministry, which regulates the industry, says that it could take until 2020 before Poland begins to deliver commercial shale gas at a level of profit seen in the US.Driving through fields and forests 80km outside of Gdansk on Poland’s northern Baltic coast, it is easy to miss the birthplace of Poland’s shale gas dream.Two large metal wellheads, barely visible from the road in the middle of a large field, mark the graves of the country’s first vertical and horizontal shale gas wells.Drilled by 3Legs in 2010 and 2011, the wells did produce some gas, but not enough to start commercial production.Mr Parmar says that the weight of red tape, which can mean waiting 18 months for permission to start drilling for gas, slowly eroded the company’s finances and appetite to continue investing in new wells.“These delays deter investment,” he says. 3Legs in September handed over its concessions to ConocoPhillips and stopped its operations in Poland, joining Total, Eni, ExxonMobil and three other foreign companies in packing their bags.“We are working to shrink decision-making times, to make it as easy as possible for the companies,” says Pawel Mikusek, spokesman at Poland’s environment ministry. “But come on, it is geology. It takes years. We need to take a breath and let investors do their work.”One investor that has not lost hope is Ireland’s San Leon Energy, which has concessions in Poland. “At times it has been very frustrating, very bureaucratic, but things have changed . . . The government is very supportive,” says the company’s executive chairman Oisin Fanning. “Shale gas will be proven, and will flow in Poland.”In 2011, estimates of Polish shale gas reserves were 5.3tn cubic metres, enough for 300 years of domestic gas demand. Government officials talked of the industry creating a sovereign wealth fund to rival Norway’s.Today, the ministry reckons the country may have around 55 years’ worth of gas, if it can be extracted. So far 66 wells have been drilled, according to the government. None are producing gas in commercially viable quantities.“I think it’s fair to say that there was a little too much expectation, too much hope,” says Jacek Libucha, principal at the Boston Consulting Group in Warsaw.""Now the effort is being led by the state-owned companies who have financial resources, but are having to learn the right knowledge to exploit the potential . . . [their] intention is to develop it at their own pace, rather than this gold-rush mentality that was present a few years ago.”A new hydrocarbon law, two years in the making, was passed in August in an attempt to smooth the regulatory process for shale gas miners in Poland, while the environment ministry says it has boosted its team dealing with industry applications to 10 people, from just three in 2012.ConocoPhillips, which invested in Polish shale gas assets alongside 3Legs in 2009, says that it is still conducting tests to determine the prospects of its concessions in Poland.It said that it “continues to advocate for regulatory change that promotes investment while protecting Polish interests”."
101;COP;Conocophillips;2014-11-13T17:43:56Z;US set to export more oil condensate;Energy law expert says current moves will become the norm;Exporting soaring volumes of ultralight US oil without getting the government’s direct assent will soon be the norm, an expert on energy law has said.If borne out, the trend outlined by Jake Dweck in remarks to be delivered on Thursday could turn a trickle of so-called “processed condensate” exports into a river – and help guide debate on the future of Washington’s four-decade-old restriction on crude oil exports.Liberalisation of oil exports is a priority for US producers. Some of the leading independent companies, including ConocoPhillips, Continental Resources, Chesapeake Energy and Anadarko Petroleum, recently formed a group called the Producers for American Crude Oil Exports, known as Pace, to lobby for an end to the restrictions.In the absence of a policy change, oil companies are finding ways around the constraints.Mr Dweck this year represented Enterprise Products Partners as it became one of two oil companies to win an explicit government ruling to export condensate, a type of ultralight oil abundant in Texas’s Eagle Ford shale region.Other companies then filed requests for similar rulings but the US Bureau of Industry and Security had yet to act on them.As they waited, the energy and mining group BHP Billiton began to export condensate without a fresh ruling by certifying that its practices complied with existing approvals.Mr Dweck said the Enterprise ruling was not exclusive to the company but permitted exports of condensate processed at any stabiliser with a distillation tower.“It is perfectly legal for a company to export condensate without first obtaining its own classification,” he said in his prepared remarks.Mr Dweck, partner at the Sutherland law firm, added in an interview: “What’s going to happen in the next three or four months is that the condensate exports in the US will go into a second phase.“That phase is the self-classification phase. It will become the norm. Companies will begin to feel comfortable self-classifying based on the Enterprise classification.”The chief executive of Plains, a pipeline company, told analysts last week that “politics” had contributed to “what appears to be a cessation of progress with respect to other companies’ similar requests” for rulings.Plains had not exported condensate, he added, but advisers indicated that it could pursue self-classification.Former Obama advisor on push to end ban on crude oil exportsOther oil companies refused to say whether they planned to follow BHP’s lead. Some suggested they wanted to wait to see how the US authorities responded to the move before taking similar steps themselves, indicating that there could be more self-classified exports if BHP’s plan succeeded.Continental said it was “pursuing opportunities to export crude”, without giving details.Chevron is exploring possible exports but would be selling other companies’ condensate through its trading arm rather than its own production.Pioneer Natural Resources, the other company that already has a ruling, said on Thursday it planned to export half its US condensate output next year.The Bureau of Industry and Security had no immediate comment.

This betrays a woeful lack of vision. Within the past two days the bank, in and out of reputational rehab with the frequency of Lindsay Lohan, has produced at least three nasty surprises. Little imagination is required to extrapolate fresh embarrassments from these, such as:An open-ended liability for bad stuff. Since coughing up £453m for alleged Libor-rigging misdeeds in 2012, Barclays has been a go-to bank for fines and compensation. Quarterly results on Thursday were held back by a £500m provision for inquiries into Forex manipulation.This piecemeal approach is too slow. Simpler for the International Court of Justice to determine Barclays is “responsible for everything that hacks people off both historically and in the future, yea, even unto the seventh generation”. Tushar Morzaria is a smart finance guy. But even he could have trouble provisioning for that.International conflict. Barclays has had more dust-ups in the Middle East than Lawrence of Arabia. Accusations of corrupt payments caused dismay in Qatar. Now a tycoon is suing Barclays for $10bn in a case involving the Saudi government. This could escalate into war between the bank and the desert kingdom. The Saudis would likely depute the US and UK to do any actual fighting. That’s the usual arrangement.BarCap opens a food truck. Profits at the investment bank crashed 38 per cent to £1.3bn in the past nine months. Perhaps deal divas weren’t 110 per cent motivated by CEO Antony Jenkins’ decision to pull them out of full-service investment banking.Browbeaten fundie Jeremie Banet showed the way at Pimco, quitting to sell cheese toasties from a truck. BarCap boss Tom King is said to be a dab hand with a spatula. A pancake van catering to North Colonnade toilers could give him a fresh start too.Green giantShell has made an intriguing choice of chairman in Chad Holliday. Oil men rarely have close links with the green lobby, excitable members of which disrupted Shell’s disposal of the Brent Spar installation in 1995. But Mr Holliday is a strong advocate of environmental responsibility, having co-chaired a UN working group on sustainable energy.Fund managers say Mr Holliday’s environmental awareness should help keep Shell out of trouble. The group pulled its backing for the London Array, a big wind farm, in 2008. It is today an important developer of oil sands, an energy source critics accuse of producing too much toxic waste.Mr Holliday and the executives should at least see eye-to-eye on the virtues of biofuels, which Shell produces from sugar cane at Brazilian joint venture Raizen. He took a pioneering interest in bioethanol when running US chemicals group DuPont.PRs insist the arrival of the man who spun off Conoco does not presage a shake-up of Shell too. Even without it, he should prove more memorable than low-key predecessor Jorma Ollila. A distinctive name helps. Didn’t a pop group called Chad Holliday and the Twangin’ Teens top the charts in ’62? Or perhaps I imagined that.Access baggageBring them your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning for employment. Investor relations, the profession which trumpets companies’ financial messages, is bracing for an influx of corporate brokers and stock analysts shaken loose by reform.The Financial Conduct Authority is expected to force investment managers to bear many costs currently passed on to clients. These include charges for “ corporate access” – meetings between investors and chief executives arranged by brokers – and research. These are often paid via dealing commissions.Harder to be generous with your own money than someone else’s. Lower spending by fund managers would prompt a shakeout of brokerage staff. Investor relations could provide a refuge for some of the redundant. Pay is lower, at £100,000-£130,000 for an IR boss without a director’s title. Hours are shorter, outside results periods.Sue Scholes, chair of The Investor Relations Society, says her profession will expand. More companies would organise their own programmes of investor meetings. Fund managers would get more corporate data directly.Not everyone would make the cut. The culture of investor relations is politer than that of brokerages. No one in IR will be impressed by a jocular nickname or a stainless steel liver.Cook unclosetedThe coming out of Apple’s Tim Cook is a chance to remind readers of Tomkins’ Rule.

103;COP;Conocophillips;2014-10-30T12:02:57Z;Oil price fall drags on ConocoPhillips earnings as output rises;Decline in earnings follows similar falls at other groups;ConocoPhillips, the US oil and gas group, plans to cut its capital spending next year as falling oil prices squeeze its revenues, the company has said.Ryan Lance, Conoco’s chief executive, told analysts on a call that while the company had not yet set its capital budget for next year, it expected to spend less than the $16bn planned for 2014, and that it had previously set as a likely outcome for 2015.He added that with large investment projects in Canada and Australia now past the peak in their spending, Conoco had “increased flexibility” to cut its expenditures to respond to market conditions, including the option of reining back its drilling in less-developed shale areas of the US.“We have the flexibility and resiliency to weather lower prices, [and] we’ll exercise that flexibility as appropriate,” Mr Lance said.He was speaking as Conoco reported a 12 per cent fall in underlying earnings per share for the third quarter, as the fall in oil prices, which have dropped by about 25 per cent in the past four months, outweighed the rise in its output.Underlying earnings, excluding one-off items such as the gain from selling its business in Nigeria, were $1.6bn, or $1.29 a share, significantly above analysts’ average expectations of $1.21.The decline follows similar falls in earnings reported by other US and European oil companies, including BP and BG Group.Conoco and other US shale oil producers have argued that the industry could still grow even at prices significantly below present levels of about $86 per barrel of internationally traded Brent crude.However, like many of its smaller peers in the shale industry, Conoco has been spending more on drilling new wells and other capital expenditure than it has been generating in cash from its operations.In the third quarter, it generated $4.15bn in cash from its continuing operations, and had capital spending of $4.6bn. It also paid about $900m in dividends, which were raised by 6 per cent in July, offset by $1.4bn raised from asset sales.The company has set a target of covering its capital spending from its cash flow by late 2016 or 2017, and said it was sticking to that in spite of the recent weakness in oil prices, although it might no longer exceed the objective by as much as it had previously expected.Mr Lance also reiterated that the dividend was “our top priority”.Unlike most of the largest international oil and gas companies, Conoco’s production is rising, and it has set an objective of continuing growth in output volumes at 3-5 per cent per year.Mr Lance said he expected Conoco to meet that until at least 2017 even if oil prices fell further, for example by pulling back from opening up new shale areas and concentrating on the most productive established regions: the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas and the Bakken of North Dakota.In the third quarter, oil and gas output from continuing operations, excluding Libya where production has been hit by turmoil in the country, and the effects of downtime for maintenance, was up 4 per cent at 1.473m barrels of oil equivalent a day.There was particularly strong growth in output from the Eagle Ford and Bakken, which was 33 per cent higher than in the third quarter of 2013.Mr Lance said the company had been spending on large projects including Surmont 2, an oil sands development in Canada, and APLNG, its liquefied natural gas plant in Australia, and both commitments would next year be past their peak.Conoco also had some bad news on a once-promising oil discovery in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico, called Coronado, which had looked like a very good prospect when first discovered but had seemed much less attractive after a second well had been drilled, and has now been abandoned.
104;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConocoPhillips puts North Sea oil stake on the block;;ConocoPhillips, the US energy group, is auctioning its stake in the UK’s largest oilfield at a time when the future of North Sea oil has become a central battleground in the debate about Scottish independence.The Houston-based company has hired banks to sell its 24 per cent stake in the Clair oilfield, according to people familiar with the matter. The exact value of the stake could not be ascertained, but these people said it could fetch between $2bn and $3bn.The project, which sits in Scottish territorial waters west of the Shetland islands, is one of the UK’s most prized oilfields. The fact that Conoco is looking to exit the project is a sign of the challenges facing the oil industry as it tries to develop potentially valuable but complex reserves.The Clair field was discovered in 1977, and is believed to hold 7bn barrels of oil in place, but production did not begin until 2005. A second phase, known as Clair Ridge, is under development at a cost of £4.5bn, with a planned start-up in 2017.Some campaigners for a Yes vote in Thursday’s referendum on Scottish independence have argued that Clair could generate income and tax revenues that would sustain Scotland’s public finances for decades. Industry sources, however, have emphasised the technical difficulties of extracting the oil.BP, the operator of the field and owner of a 28.6 per cent stake, has launched an appraisal programme to drill six wells to evaluate Clair’s potential for further development. Four wells have been drilled so far but BP has not yet disclosed the results.The other shareholders in Clair are Royal Dutch Shell with 28 per cent and Chevron with 19 per cent.One issue for buyers is the gap in expectations about the UK’s production potential. Westminster politicians and industry experts have challenged the Scottish government’s claims about oil and gas reserves as wildly optimistic.Pro-independence campaigners have pointed to figures as high as 30bn barrels of oil equivalent waiting to be extracted. The Aberdeen-based billionaire Sir Ian Wood, former head of oil services supplier Wood Group, suggested in an interview with the website Energy Voice that 15bn to 16.5bn barrels was more likely.Selling the stake in Clair would fit Conoco’s strategy of disentangling from many of its international commitments to invest in opportunities opened up by the North American shale boom. It sold its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil of Russia in 2010-11, and last year sold its 8.4 per cent stake in the giant Kashagan oilfield in Kazakhstan to the country’s government for $5.4bn.Conoco is one of the largest producers in the booming Eagle Ford shale of south Texas. In April it revised up its estimate of its recoverable resources in the area by 40 per cent to at least 2.5bn barrels equivalent of oil and gas.It also operates in other areas of rising* oil production including the Bakken formation of North Dakota and the Permian basin of west Texas.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in London
105;COP;Conocophillips;2014-07-31T15:05:04Z;ExxonMobil profits surge as output falls;;Two of the US’s biggest oil producers revealed the continuing benefits of soaring domestic oil production as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips unveiled second-quarter earnings underpinned by domestic production.Domestic production – up 9 per cent on last year’s second quarter, to 458,000 barrels per day (b/d) – helped Exxon to record net income up 28 per cent to $8.78bn, on revenues up 4.7 per cent to $112bn. Along with asset sales, improved margins in upstream production cancelled out the effects of a 5.4 per cent decline in worldwide oil and gas production on an oil-equivalent basis.The decline against the second quarter of 2013 – the latest of a series– was largely a result of the expiry of the company’s onshore production concession in Abu Dhabi. However, the sale of the company’s interests in power utilities in Hong Kong increased net income by $1.2bn, while improved profitability boosted the figures by $580m.Rex Tillerson, chief executive, said the results had been achieved through “strong operational performance and portfolio management”.“We continue to enhance shareholder value by funding capital projects and delivering robust shareholder returns through dividends and share purchases,” he said.ConocoPhillips’ production in continental US grew 10 per cent to 540,000 b/d, while production in Alaska grew 2 per cent to 193,000 b/d. The growth helped to sustain net income, which rose marginally to $2.08bn from $2.05bn in last year’s second quarter, on revenue up 4 per cent to $14.7bn.Both companies’ figures reflected the current pattern for most oil majors of fast-growing production in the US and stable or declining production in other, more mature areas worldwide.Exxon recorded substantial progress in the quarter on a liquefied natural gas export project on Sakhalin Island, in Russia’s far east.However, David Rosenthal, vice-president of investor relations, said the company was currently unable to say how new sanctions intended to restrict the development of Russia’s oil and gas industry might affect its Russian projects.“Given that we don’t have sufficient information, I’m just not in a position to comment at this time on the effect of the sanctions,” he said.Exxon’s production in Canada and South America increased 7 per cent to 282,000 b/d. However, production in Europe – where the company recently announced a fresh round of investments– fell 10 per cent. Production in Asia, hit by the end of the Abu Dhabi concession, fell 23 per cent to 597,000 b/d.Gas production fell 5 per cent to 10.7m cubic feet daily. Capital and exploration spending was down 4 per cent against last year’s second quarter to $9.8bn.US upstream earnings were up 9 per cent to $1.19bn, while non-US upstream earnings were up 28 per cent to $6.69bn. Downstream earnings worldwide were up 80 per cent to $711m. Earnings per share – which grew faster than net income thanks to the effects of share repurchases – were 32 per cent up, to $2.05.Exxon’s shares fell 4.2 per cent by close of trading in New York at $98.94, while ConocoPhillips fell 2.5 per cent at $82.50.
106;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oando to seal deal for ConocoPhillips’s Nigerian assets;;Oando, the Nigerian homegrown oil company, has closed a much-delayed $1.65bn deal to buy assets from ConocoPhillips, capping its long transformation from a leading Nigerian fuel importer into a major local oil producer.The completion of the deal, expected to be announced on Thursday, will boost Oando’s oil production in the west African country 10-fold to about 50,000 barrels a day, according to people familiar with the transaction.At that level, Oando will rival local peer Seplat as Nigeria’s largest domestic crude oil and natural gas producer.The transaction – one of the largest deals so far this year in sub-Saharan Africa – coupled with the successful $500m listing of Seplat in London and Lagos signal the dramatic growth of the homegrown Nigerian oil and natural gas industry.Over the past five years, groups such as Oando, Seplat, Shoreline Natural Resources and Seven Energy have expanded exponentially, buying assets worth $5bn from foreign energy groups. Royal Dutch Shell, Total of France, Eni of Italy and Chevron and ConocoPhillips of the US have sold large Nigerian onshore oilfields in a retreat from Africa’s biggest and oldest oil industry.International oil companies are focusing instead on offshore operations, where they are able to avoid the violence and theft that has for decades plagued the Niger Delta.Wale Tinubu, chief executive of Lagos-based Oando, earlier this year said in an interview that homegrown oil companies were set to account for nearly a quarter of the Nigeria’s oil production within five years, up from about 10 per cent today.“The sector could be up to 600,000 barrels a day in five years,” Mr Tinubu said in May, up from almost zero only five years ago. Today, Nigeria produces less than 2m b/d, although the country has in the past pumped about 2.5m b/d.But the deal between Oando and Conoco also shows that Nigerian homegrown oil producers face an uphill battle to buy assets from foreign majors.Oando has taken roughly half a year more than it expected to close the deal, according to people familiar with the transaction. This delay was down to the complexity of raising enough capital and difficulties navigating the Nigerian bureaucracy.But industry executives believe that future deals will be easier because of the arrival of new financiers, including sovereign wealth funds such as Temasek of Singapore, and commodities trading houses including Geneva-based Mercuria.The arrival of international investors is critical for the sector, as the new companies face multibillion-dollar price tags to purchase the oil and gasfields that are on offer from foreign groups such as Shell. Local banks and investors cannot finance the investments on their own, according to industry executives and bankers.The arrival of deep-pocketed financiers will mark the point when the industry embarks on its first round of consolidation through mergers and acquisitions. ABC Orjiako, chairman of Seplat, this year said that the Nigerian homegrown energy industry was “not far from the first wave of M&A”.
107;COP;Conocophillips;2014-05-01T13:16:40Z;ExxonMobil and Conoco beat earnings forecasts;;The effect of this year’s cold winter in the US in pushing up natural gas prices helped ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, two of the largest US oil companies, report earnings significantly above analysts’ expectations for the first quarter of 2014.The price of the gas sold by Exxon in the US rose by 49 per cent compared to the first quarter of 2013, to $4.78 per thousand cubic feet.The two companies have faced numerous difficulties in their attempts to increase production, and Exxon reported a fall for the quarter while Conoco reported a relatively modest increase. But their earnings have been boosted by higher prices for their production, including Canadian heavy crude from tar sands as well as US gas.Exxon, which is the world’s largest listed oil company by market capitalisation, reported a 4 per cent drop in post-tax net income to $9.1bn, and a 1 per cent drop in earnings per share to $2.10, compared to an average forecast of $1.88.Conoco, the third-largest US oil and gas producer by market capitalisation, reported underlying net income, excluding the effect of one-off items such as disposal gains, up 29 per cent at $2.25bn.The fall in Exxon’s profits was caused by weakness in its refineries, especially in the US, and its chemicals division. Its worldwide refining profits dropped 47 per cent to $813m.That was offset by the rising profitability of oil and gas production, especially in the US, where earnings from those operations rose 45 per cent rise to $1.24bn: the sharpest increase for any of Exxon’s segments.Exxon bought heavily into US natural gas with the $41bn acquisition of XTO Energy in 2010, and has been suffering from the subsequent weakness of US gas prices, but the cold weather has helped turn that round.Exxon’s international oil and gas production operations also reported increased profits, up 6 per cent at $6.54bn, even though its production volumes have continued to decline. Oil and gas production averaged 4.15m barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, down from 4.4m boe/d in the equivalent period of 2013.Production was hit by the loss of Exxon’s share of the international companies’ concession in Abu Dhabi, which expired in January, and by weaker demand for natural gas in some countries. That was offset by rising production at Kearl, Exxon’s new oil sands project in Canada.Exxon is working on plans for expansion in Russia in co-operation with Rosneft, the state-controlled oil company, and said those projects would continue in spite of the conflict in Ukraine and sanctions imposed by the US.David Rosenthal, Exxon’s vice-president of investor relations, said on a call with analysts: “With regards to Russia, of course we will comply with all sanctions, but . . . all of the activities that we had originally planned for this year are under way and proceeding as planned.”In a sign of the greater financial discipline being imposed by Exxon and other large oil companies, its capital and exploration spending fell sharply, dropping 28 per cent to $8.44bn, although most of that drop was accounted for by the comparison with 2013 when Exxon paid $3.1bn for Celtic Exploration of Canada.Conoco was similarly boosted by higher prices for US gas and Canadian oil.Its results also benefited from a 41 per cent increase in production from operations in the Eagle Ford shale of Texas and the Bakken formation of North Dakota, the two principal centres of the US shale oil revolution. Overall, the group’s production from continuing operations, excluding its assets in Libya, was up 1.6 per cent at 1.53m boe/d for the first quarter.Ryan Lance, Conoco’s chief executive, said the company was off to “a great start” in 2014, and added: “This quarter’s performance gives us confidence that we are on track to achieve 3 to 5 per cent growth in both volumes and margins”.
108;COP;Conocophillips;2014-03-05T16:58:40Z;YPF looking for partners to boost output after Repsol exit;;"Miguel Galuccio has three principal objectives for 2014: “to produce, produce and produce.”To help achieve that aim, Galuccio, who has run the Argentine energy company YPF since the government expropriated a 51 per cent share from Spain’s Repsol in 2012, is looking for partners.Until very recently, when Argentina and Repsol finally managed to bury the hatchet after almost two years of trying to reach an agreement over compensation, few deals have been forthcoming from foreign oil companies.There has been a lot of talk but little action. Only last month, Malaysia’s Petronas signed an MOU with YPF, but no concrete commitments were made.Now that Argentina has made an effort to show that it respects the rule of law over the Repsol affair, it is hoping to attract more interest from oil majors in the country’s extensive energy resources, which include some of the largest shale oil and gas reserves in the world.To that end, Galuccio was in Houston at the weekend at an event organised by John Watson, CEO of Chevron (the only oil company to have signed a significant deal with Argentina since the Repsol fiasco blew up), with grandees from some of the world’s biggest oil companies present, including Conoco Phillips, Total and Statoil.Ramping up energy production is of crucial importance to Argentina, since falls in both production and reserves have turned the country into a net energy importer in recent years. That drain on foreign currency – in a country that has not been able to borrow abroad since the 2001 debt default – was one of the main reasons behind the January devaluation.Galuccio has succeeded in bringing vast improvements to YPF itself, with its production of both oil and gas rising by over 9 per cent in January this year alone, according to official figures. YPF’s production increases have helped Argentina to save over $1bn in gas imports.Officials also highlight how YPF invested $6bn in 2013, compared to $3bn in 2011 under Repsol’s control – although the Spanish company says it had its hands tied by paying loans that Petersen, an Argentine company backed by President Cristina Fernandez’s husband, Nestor Kirchner, took out to buy a share of YPF.But it is one thing for YPF to increase production and quite another for the rest of the sector – let alone attracting new companies to start producing. High inflation, price and exchange controls and subsidies – which hamper profitability and encourage excess domestic consumption – remain a serious deterrent.These issues must be addressed by the government if it really wants significant amounts of foreign investment to start flowing back into Argentina. Galuccio cannot bring it back single-handedly.Back to beyondbricsRelated reading:

109;COP;Conocophillips;2013-12-18T11:18:23Z;BP discovery offset by $1bn write-off after poor Brazil results;;BP has announced a “significant” oil discovery in the deepwater US Gulf of Mexico – but also said that it is writing off $1.08bn after poor results from a well off the coast of Brazil.Its discovery in the Gila prospect caps what BP described as its most successful year for new field exploration for almost a decade.However, the news on Wednesday was overshadowed by the writedown in Brazil, a country that BP has often touted as one of the most exciting frontiers in its portfolio.BP said it was relinquishing Pitanga, one of its Brazil offshore blocks, because an exploration well had not found any commercial quantities of oil or gas.As a result, the oil group said it was writing off $230m in drilling costs related to Pitanga, as well as $850m associated with the value of the abandoned block, which it acquired as part of a $7bn deal with US oil group Devon Energy in 2010.The write-off represents more than a quarter of the $3.2bn value BP attributed to the Brazilian blocks acquired from Devon. So far, the company has made only one new discovery in that acreage: Benedito, in the CM-471 block. This find was announced in April, but it is still unclear whether it is commercial.Although the Devon Brazil assets have been disappointing, BP said they provided it with a crucial foothold in Brazil, on which it has since built. Earlier this week, BP and its partner Petrobras announced a major offshore oil discovery at their Pitu well, in a frontier region known as the equatorial margin.Analysts said the news on Gila in the Gulf of Mexico showed that BP was rediscovering its exploration mojo after something of a lean period. Last year, BP’s reserves replacement ratio – the extent to which it replaces the crude oil it produces with new reserves – was only 77 per cent, a figure that the company itself described as “abnormally low”.But BP is not alone. According to Bernstein Research, the European oil majors as a group chalked up an average reserve replacement ratio of only 92 per cent last year.BP’s performance in 2013 is set to be better than last year, thanks to two big deals it has finalised this month: a $16bn tight gas project in the Sultanate of Oman, and a $28bn gas investment in Azerbaijan.Oil finds this year could also push its reserve replacement higher in future years. BP said that, in the course of 2013, it had participated in 15 completed exploration wells, which resulted in seven potentially commercial discoveries.Lamar McKay, head of BP’s upstream division, said these successes “confirm our confidence in our ability to sustain BP’s resource base”.Gila could be the most compelling of the recent finds. The prospect, co-owned with ConocoPhillips, is located in the Paleogene trend, where BP has already made two big oil discoveries in recent years: Kaskida in 2006 and Tiber in 2009.Gila underscores the company’s gradual recovery from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, when an explosion on a drilling rig it was leasing in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 men and unleashed the worst offshore oil spill in US history.
110;COP;Conocophillips;2013-09-26T18:17:10Z;3D Robotics’ drone ambitions take off;;3D Robotics, a pioneer in selling low-cost drones to technology enthusiasts, has raised $30m in new funding as it scales up to focus on commercial applications for its unmanned flying vehicles.The deal, led by Foundry Group and True Ventures, is believed to be the largest venture-capital investment yet in a civilian drone company, after Airware raised $10.7m from Google Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz this year.While the multibillion-dollar drone market has been confined largely to military applications, several start-ups in Silicon Valley and beyond have begun to prepare for new rules allowing unmanned vehicles to fly in US airspace, expected in 2015.Chris Anderson, chief executive of 3D Robotics, said that agriculture would be among the first markets to test commercial applications for the technology.“These platforms are now mature enough to be tools rather than experimental,” he said. “The costs are coming down and the performance is going up. It’s time to put it to work.”Farmers are already allowed to use drones on their own land to survey crops, he said, but wider use will have to wait until the Federal Aviation Authority grants permits.In the first commercial drone flight in US airspace, oil and gas group ConocoPhillips this month tested a 40lb unmanned Boeing drone over Alaska, as part of the FAA’s assessment of the technology. Drones could eventually be used to monitor ice flows and whale movements around drilling sites, Conoco said.“I think that most people hear the word ‘drone’ and picture war machines, Terminator movies, ‘Big Brother’ surveillance and other uses that make many of our skins crawl,” Jason Mendelson, a managing director at Foundry, said in a blogpost. “That being said, I’m stoked that we are investing in technology that could be used for other uses.”He said these could include search and rescue, delivery in urban areas, and as cameras for filming movies and sports.3D Robotics, co-founded by Mr Anderson and Jordi Munoz in 2009, raised its first substantial round of outside funding last December.“The first phase of the company was the DIY community and the maker movement,” Mr Anderson, former editor of Wired magazine, told the FT. “The second phase that started with me coming on as chief executive was to professionalise the company, moving from hackers to more consumers.”3D Robotics is preparing for a November launch of Iris, a drone for consumers which costs less than $1,000 and which requires little technical knowledge to operate. The device will compete with the likes of the DJI Phantom, a $500 “quadcopter” that has proved popular for aerial photography.Mr Anderson said that the third phase for the company was now beginning. The funds would allow 3D Robotics to develop applications suited to particular kinds of crops and to increase its sales force. It has offices in Berkeley and San Diego in California, and manufacturing facilities in Tijuana, Mexico.
111;COP;Conocophillips;2013-09-25T00:14:24Z;Conoco in landmark Alaska drone flight;;The first commercial drone flight in US-controlled airspace has been carried out by ConocoPhillips, the oil and gas group, in the remote Arctic waters off the north coast of Alaska.Conoco launched a 40-lb ScanEagle surveillance drone, built by Boeing, from a research ship in the Chukchi Sea, about 120 miles from the Alaskan coast.The company said this month’s 36-minute flight was intended to test the drone’s sensors and navigation system, and help streamline the approval process for future flights in US airspace.Although brief, it was a landmark in the progress of civil operations by unmanned airborne systems, as drones are known in the industry.Although ScanEagle flew in international airspace, it was in a section that is managed by the US Federal Aviation Administration for the International Civil Aviation Organisation.Last year Congress instructed the FAA to set up test sites for the commercial and government use of drones in US airspace, and set a target of 2015 for their integration into the national air traffic control system.The FAA has chosen three blocks over international waters as the first such test sites, including the region of the Chukchi Sea used by Conoco.The ScanEagle, built by Boeing’s drone subsidiary Insitu, has a 10-foot wingspan and a propeller engine that makes it sound like a model aircraft in flight, and can fly for 18 hours on 1.5 gallons of fuel, sending live video back to its controller. Insitu describes it as delivering “persistent imagery on land or at sea at a fraction of the cost of other surveillance methods”. It has been used by the US military since 2004.Conoco said ScanEagles could be used to monitor ice floes and whale movements, keeping it informed of potential threats or environmental risks while drilling in Arctic seas.The company said in April that it was putting on hold its plans to drill in the Chukchi Sea in 2014, after Royal Dutch Shell suffered a series of problems in the Arctic, but said it was confident of its ability to operate in the region safely.Trond-Erik Johansen, president, ConocoPhillips Alaska, said airborne surveillance was often a component of offshore projects, and drones “could be useful in our monitoring and data collection efforts, with the benefit of improved safety and lower noise levels as compared to using manned aircraft”.The company is now looking at plans for possible additional flights, and considering other applications for drones. One proposal in the oil industry has been to use them to scan pipelines for spills or other problems.The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a US industry group, believes that agriculture and public safety will together account for about 90 per cent of the commercial and civil drone market, with the rest coming from industries such as power distribution, television news and oil and gas.The FAA has said safety is its top priority.Ray LaHood, then transportation secretary, said last year that the planned drone test sites would “help us ensure that our high safety standards are maintained as the use of these aircraft becomes more widespread”.In a blog post this week, the agency said the Conoco project was “giving the FAA and industry needed experience and a path forward to certify UAS for more commercial operations, both in the Arctic and elsewhere.”This article has been amended to correct the name of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
112;COP;Conocophillips;2013-08-19T22:55:15Z;Cobalt hit as deep Gulf well comes up dry;;The deepest well yet drilled in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico has come up “dry”, without usable volumes of oil or gas, the company leading the project said on Monday.Shares in Cobalt International Energy, an independent exploration and production company that was founded in 2005 and floated in 2009, fell 15.2 per cent on Monday, cutting about $1.8bn from its market capitalisation.The company said the Ardennes #1 well had been safely drilled to a depth of 36,552 feet, but had not found commercial quantities of oil or gas.Cobalt had been the operator in charge of the project, and held a 42 per cent stake. ConocoPhillips of the US had 30 per cent and Total of France 28 per cent.The failure of Ardennes #1 follows recent successes in the deep waters of the Gulf, including the Shenandoah 2 and Coronado wells, led by Anadarko and Chevron respectively. Cobalt has a 20 per cent stake in Shenandoah 2.Van Whitfield, Cobalt’s chief operating officer, said he was “disappointed” with the Ardennes #1’s results, but added that the company remained “very excited about our Gulf of Mexico prospect portfolio”.The rig that drilled Ardennes #1, operated by Ensco, is now moving on to another well in the Gulf for Cobalt. Earlier this month, Cobalt signed a contract with Rowan, another contractor, for a rig to drill deepwater wells in the region for three years starting in 2015.Exploration successes in the US and west Africa helped lift Cobalt’s shares 27 per cent in 2011 and a further 70 per cent in 2012. They have fallen 6 per cent in 2013.
113;COP;Conocophillips;2013-08-08T17:30:12Z;Horn of Africa oil: deals start flowing despite legal mess;;By Adam Green of This is AfricaThis week, a new company – Soma Oil and Gas – signed an exploration deal with the Mogadishu-based federal government of Somalia. The agreement came as a surprise. The government had previously abstained from signing such deals, fearing they would inflame ongoing territorial tensions (which the UN also warned about).But it could also ratchet up tensions between the federal government and the two semi-autonomous northern provinces, Somaliland and Puntland, as well as between major oil companies, which have licenses dating back to the early 1990s, and new ones who are signing their own, often in overlapping territories. All told, the Horn of Africa is quickly becoming a spaghetti soup of deals.Soma, which has former UK Conservative party leader Michael Howard as a non-executive chairman, will conduct resource surveys in a region blessed with similar geological features to Yemen and Saudi Arabia.The problems start with the inconsistency between the Somali constitution – which allows regional governments some autonomy to enter resource agreements – and the current Somali petroleum bill, yet to be adopted but frequently invoked by the Mogadishu-based federal government, which says the central government alone has the “privilege to distribute natural resources”.Abdullahi Haider, an adviser to the Somali government, has argued that oil licenses awarded by regional governments are illegal, and that prior license holders (mostly the majors) will be considered privileged partners. The federal government has already challenged agreements made between Turkish-British company Genel and the Somaliland government.That has angered Issa Farah, head of Puntland’s petroleum and minerals agency, who complains that both the federal and Somaliland governments are crossing its borders and breaking the rules. “They cannot go around saying companies operating in Puntland are illegal, and sign contracts left and right when the constitution of the country clearly states they have no right to do so,” he says.And oil companies are starting to step on each others toes as they begin signing licenses on plots previously licensed to others. BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have stakes dating to before the civil war in 1991, but smaller energy companies are moving in. Liberty Oil signed a license on an area formerly given to Shell. Norwegian company DNO’s contract clashes with a prior license held by ConocoPhillips, and DNO also appear to have an overlapping license with Canadian company, Africa Oil.Farah says the government in Mogadishu should tread carefully and not exceed its powers.“The federal government of Somalia only has four powers – defence, foreign affairs, immigration and citizenship, and monetary,” he said. They can do what they want within the four powers within a limited framework, but they are not currently entitled to do more than that including introduce new legislation outside those areas”.Puntland’s own constitution does not compel it to be part of the federal system if it does not work in the people’s favour, Farah added. “There will not be a unified country if the federal government continues in this way”.Farah is equally critical of neighbouring Somaliland, which in April signed a production-sharing agreement with DNO, and Genel, headed by former BP chief Tony Hayward. Farah says DLO’s block and Genel’s both infringe Puntland’s territory.Both Genel and DNO are on familiar ground when it comes to uncertain territorial claims, given their interests in Iraqi Kurdistan.

114;COP;Conocophillips;2013-07-02T16:27:37Z;CNPC to take $5bn stake in Kashagan oilfield;Decision to sell to the Chinese will go down badly in India;China National Petroleum Co is set to acquire a stake in Kashagan, a huge oilfield in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea, according to a senior executive in the Kazakh state oil company, in a deal worth $5bn.It would represent the largest overseas acquisition by CNPC and reinforce China’s dominant position in Kazakhstan’s oil industry. Chinese groups already account for more than a quarter of the country’s oil and gas production.Kashagan, which is due to start production in the fourth quarter of this year, is the world’s most expensive oil development project, with its first phase alone costing $40.6bn.Daniyar Berlibayev, deputy chairman of KazMunaiGas, Kazakhstan’s state oil and gas company, said it would exercise an option to acquire an 8.4 per cent interest in the Kashagan consortium from ConocoPhillips and sell it on to CNPC.“Why shouldn’t we choose them, from a pragmatic point of view?” he said in an interview in the Kazakh capital, Astana. “We are already linked to the Chinese: they are our partners, and they are our customers.”Mr Berlibayev said a deal with the Chinese would allow Kazakhstan to diversify its export markets for Kashagan’s oil by providing access to the Chinese market. “We have a direct pipeline to China that does not pass through any transit countries,” he said. “We are linked to China in many ways.”The deal would eclipse CNPC’s $4.2bn acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in a natural gas block operated by Italy’s ENI off the coast of Mozambique, which was announced in March.But Kazakhstan’s decision to sell to the Chinese will go down badly in India. Conoco initially agreed to sell its stake in Kashagan to India’s ONGC Videsh last year for $5bn, in a deal that was hailed domestically as a coup for the state oil company.But under Kazakh law, the state has pre-emption rights to any big strategic asset.On Tuesday, Conoco announced it had received official notification that Kazakhstan’s oil ministry was exercising that right to pre-empt the sale to ONGC and had designated KazMunaiGas as the entity that will acquire the stake. Conoco said the sale price would remain unchanged at $5bn.“This is another milestone in progressing our asset disposition programme,” said Don Wallette, Conoco’s head of commercial, business development and corporate planning. He said the government’s decision “demonstrates the value of this asset”.The consortium developing Kashagan includes KMG, ENI, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Total SA with 16.81 per cent each, Conoco with 8.4 per cent and Japan’s Inpex with 7.56 per cent.Discovered in 2000, Kashagan is a supergiant field with 9-13bn barrels of recoverable reserves. But it has proven to be one of the world’s most challenging energy projects: its oil, contained in a high-pressure reservoir 4,200m below the seabed, is laced with hydrogen sulphide that can kill in a matter of seconds. The northern part of the Caspian, where the field is located, is frozen for five months out of the year, and is prone to huge drifts of ice that can crush conventional oil rigs.David Cameron, the UK prime minister, joined Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev for a ceremony on Sunday to mark the start-up of Kashagan’s production facilities. Production, which is due to start later this year, will progressively ramp up to 370,000 barrels a day in the venture’s first phase.
115;COP;Conocophillips;2013-07-02T14:51:04Z;Kashagan: Kazakhstan boosts stake;;"Kazakhstan seems to have overcome its initial doubts and has decided to increase its stake in the giant Kashagan oil field.So, ConocoPhillips will not be selling its 8.4 per cent stake in the offshore Caspian Sea project to India’s ONGC Videsh as planned since last year. Instead, as announced on Tuesday, Kazakhstan will use its pre-emption rights and put the stake in the hands of state-controlled KazMunaiGas (KMG). The price? $5bn, same as India would have paid.ConocoPhillips said it had been notified that the Kazakhstan oil and gas ministry was exercising its rights to the 8.4 per cent interest and had designated KMG as the buyer. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2013. “The proceeds received by ConocoPhillips under the pre-emption will remain unchanged at approximately $5 billion, including customary adjustments,” said ConocoPhillips.Don Wallette, executive vice president, Commercial, Business Development and Corporate Planning, at the US company commented:This is another important milestone in progressing our asset disposition program. The decision by the Kazakhstan government to exercise its pre-emptive right demonstrates the value of this asset and moves us closer to completing this transaction.The sale of its Kashagan interest is part of a long-standing ConocoPhillips plan to increase value for shareholders through disposals and refocusing investments on a narrower range of projects.The news is a setback for India, which has been trying to emulate China in buying stakes in foreign energy sources to augment its meagre domestic supplies. In Kazakhstan, New Delhi has faced an uphill struggle as Beijing has spent over a decade acquiring about a quarter of Kazakhstan’s oil through long-term loans for crude deals and building a pipeline to the Chinese border.Back in 2003, the Kashagan partners had blocked China buying into the consortium. But, with Beijing having transformed its position in the country since then, it seemed rather strange when it was announced last November that ONGC, and not a Chinese company, had secured the ConocoPhillips stake.Kazakh officials said as late as May that KMG would not be bidding to increase its existing 16.8 per cent stake because of the cost and risk of taking on more debt to finance a bigger share of an expensive, technologically-difficult and much-delayed project.Perhaps they changed their minds in the light of the progress made in the following months. On Sunday, British premier David Cameron visited Kashagan on a trip to Kazakhstan and opened the field jointly with Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev.As Guy Chazan wrote for the FT, first discovered in 2000, Kashagan was at the time the world’s largest oil find in 30 years. The field, a supergiant which is about twice the size of Greater London, is estimated to contain 35bn barrels of oil.Plenty to go for. But also plenty of money to spend before the job is done.Related reading:

116;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oil majors plan extra $1bn investment in Alaska;;BP, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips plan to invest an additional $1bn in the North Slope of Alaska over the next five years, in the first sign that the tax reform signed into law last month is making it more attractive to international oil groups.BP, which is the operator of the Prudhoe Bay oilfield on Alaska’s northern coast, will increase capital spending there by about 30 per cent, adding two onshore rigs to bring the total working in the area to nine.It is also evaluating a plan for the three companies to spend an additional $3bn on projects to raise the oilfield’s production, such as debottlenecking facilities and drilling 110 more wells.BP has 26 per cent of the Prudhoe Bay field, Exxon and Conoco 36 per cent each, and Chevron 1 per cent.Janet Weiss, president of BP Alaska, said the tax reform had “put Alaska back in the game” in terms of attracting investment from international groups.Estimates have suggested the reform could save the industry about $1bn a year, but the ultimate effect on the state’s revenues will depend on whether it stimulates additional investment and production.Ms Weiss said: “This was a monumental signal to the industry that the region is open for business.”Alaska had become increasingly concerned in recent years over the drop in its oil production, as the mature oilfields developed in the 1970s decline. The state’s oil production averaged 526,000 barrels a day last year, a little more than half its level of a decade ago, and just a quarter of its peak of more than 2m b/d in 1988.The US shale revolution, raising production in Texas and North Dakota, has left Alaska falling further behind, and it is now the fourth-largest oil-producing state in the US, slightly behind California.As less oil has flowed through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which carries crude from the North Slope to the Valdez terminal on Alaska’s south coast, it has become colder and moved more slowly. The industry has raised fears that if the volumes dropped below a critical threshold – estimated by consultants at 350,000 b/d – the pipeline system would have to shut down.The tax reform, which was backed by Sean Parnell, Alaska’s governor, had a contentious passage through the state’s legislature, simplified the system and abolished the structure of raised tax rates that took effect at higher oil prices.BP said it would be working for two to three years on the plan for the additional $3bn investment in Prudhoe Bay.Ms Weiss did not make a commitment to increase Alaska’s production, however, saying: “Our goal is to go after reducing decline as much as possible.”BP, Exxon and Conoco are also working on a project to bring gas from the North Slope to Alaska’s south coast and export it as liquefied natural gas, which has an estimated cost of $45bn-$65bn. A decision on that project is at least three years away.
117;COP;Conocophillips;2013-05-07T05:02:49Z;Independents: Home front mobilises to fill yawning gap;Local interests are starting to occupy area left by departing foreigners, writes Ajay Makan;Alongside an oil and gas company, petrol stations and a trading group, Wale Tinubu, the chief executive of Oando, is in the property business.Standing on a small jetty at his home in the Ikoyi district of Lagos, he gestures to Victoria Island opposite, where he plans to build waterfront office blocks.Mr Tinubu is one of a clutch of young businessmen who are beginning to tap international capital markets and move into activity that was once the domain of foreign companies. The prime example is Oando’s proposed purchase of the Nigerian assets of ConocoPhillips, the US oil major.At $1.8bn, the deal stands out as the largest in a series of transactions that has seen international oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Total of France and Eni of Italy sell about $5bn worth of onshore oilfields to local companies in the past five years.With oil majors retreating to offshore fields, the government is actively encouraging asset sales to local companies. That is providing an opportunity for the likes of Mr Tinubu to show that Nigerians can manage onshore oil assets as successfully as their foreign rivals.If completed as planned before the end of June, the Oando deal will be a high point for the government’s encouragement of increased representation by Nigerians in the oil and gas industry.Unlike other local companies that have gone into partnership with international groups in order to finance asset purchases, Oando is going it alone.Until now, the company has made most of its money in downstream operations. It is the largest importer of fuel, and sells and distributes one in five litres of petroleum in the country.In 2012, it was named in a report by a government-appointed committee investigating irregular payments to importers under the fuel subsidy scheme. But it was later cleared of any wrongdoing after the committee and auditors conducted a probe into the activities of 114 oil marketing and trading companies.The company has arranged about $750m in debt finance from local and international banks, including BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered. Oando Plc, the parent company of Toronto-listed Oando Energy Resources, the body that will ultimately control the ConocoPhillips assets, has also raised $340m in equity in Nigeria towards the deal.The scope of the capital raising is unprecedented for a domestic oil and gas company. So, too, is the level of expertise Oando will need to cultivate to run the company – for the company’s domestic rivals, international partners have not only provided access to international capital markets, but also experience.There is some scepticism in Lagos about the deal. Mr Tinubu outbid other companies by some distance. Seplat, for example, the largest of the indigenous onshore oil producers, offered more than $1bn.Mr Tinubu says his aggressive bid is easily justified. Once net cash on the target company’s balance sheet is taken into account, the purchase price is about $1.5bn, he says.The transaction also means ConocoPhillips’ 2012 and 2013 Nigerian profits flow to Oando and can be put towards the deal. Finally, it involves not only ConocoPhillips’ oilfields, but also pipeline infrastructure with the potential to take much more oil to market.To complete the transaction, Oando Energy Resources has told analysts that it is considering raising equity in Toronto. That would be the first international equity capital raising by a domestic oil and gas company. It could also pave the way for a further round of asset purchases by indigenous companies.The Nigerian stock market suffered particularly badly in the 2008 financial crisis, and has a limited pool of liquidity.The country’s pension fund, easily the largest institutional investor, favours debt over equity and some banks have been closing down their equity asset management arms in Lagos to focus on selling debt products to customers instead.All this has limited the opportunity for domestic companies to list locally and meant the flurry of asset purchases from the majors in recent years has generally been funded by debt, rather than equity.“If the pace of dealmaking is to keep up, a lot of companies will have to look outside Nigeria for equity,” says Dele Kuti, head of energy at Stanbic IBTC, the Nigerian subsidiary of Standard Bank of South Africa. He forecasts a flurry of listings in London and elsewhere, with a view to raising capital, if the Oando deal is completed successfully.
118;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips report flat profits;;Two of the largest US oil companies, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, reported earnings and production that were roughly unchanged in the first quarter of the year as they struggled to increase their oil and gas output.Exxon, the largest US company by market capitalisation, reported a 1 per cent rise in post-tax earnings to $9.5bn, thanks to the strength of its downstream refining and chemicals businesses.Conoco, which spun off its downstream operations last year, reported underlying profits from continuing operations down 2 per cent at $1.75bn.Exxon’s total oil and gas production fell 1.2 per cent – excluding effects such as quotas imposed by Opec, the producing countries cartel – to the equivalent of 4.4m barrels of oil per day.Conoco’s production rose 1.2 per cent, excluding disposals, to 1.56m barrels of oil equivalent per day.Upstream profits for both companies were hit by a fall in prices for oil and for natural gas liquids such as ethane, offset by a rise in the price of natural gas in North America.Earnings from Exxon’s upstream operations fell 10 per cent to $7.04bn, but the company was rescued by its US downstream businesses, which have benefited from relatively cheap feedstocks of crude oil and natural gas liquids resulting from the shale boom.Earnings at Exxon’s US refineries rose 72 per cent to $1.04bn, while its US chemicals operations increased earnings 74 per cent to $752m.Although its production has been shrinking, Exxon has still been generating very large cash flows. It raised its dividend for the first quarter 21 per cent from the equivalent period in 2012 to 57 cents and also bought back $5bn worth of its shares in the three months to March. The share buybacks meant earnings per share in the first quarter rose 6 per cent to $2.12.Exxon said on Wednesday it was raising its dividend for the second quarter by a further 11 per cent to 63 cents.Conoco has also been buying back its stock, and its underlying earnings per share, excluding complete and planned disposals, rose 3 per cent to $1.42.Ryan Lance, Conoco’s chief executive, said he remained committed to the goal of raising production volumes by 3 to 5 per cent per year on average. The company pointed to a strong long-term outlook, thanks in part to recent successes with oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, where Conoco has stakes in the Coronado and Shenandoah prospects. It also has important projects scheduled to come on stream in the last quarter of this year.For 2013 as a whole, however, Conoco’s total production is expected to fall to an average of 1.485m to 1.52m barrels of oil equivalent per day from continuing operations, down from 1.527m boe/d on average last year.Exxon’s shares fell 1.5 per cent to $88.07 following the results announcement, while Conoco’s were up 0.2 per cent at $58.37.
119;COP;Conocophillips;2013-04-10T18:28:59Z;Conoco puts Arctic drilling plans on ice;Move follows Shell decision to shelve its plans in the region;US oil major ConocoPhillips has said it is putting its offshore Arctic drilling plans on hold due to regulatory uncertainty, in a further sign of the declining appeal of oil exploration in the North American region.The move comes six weeks after Royal Dutch Shell shelved plans to drill off the north coast of Alaska this year. The Norwegian major Statoil has also said it will not drill the acreage it operates in Alaska’s Chukchi Sea earlier than 2015.Conoco, the largest oil producer in Alaska, said it was putting off plans to drill for oil in the Chukchi next year “given the uncertainties of evolving federal regulatory requirements and operational permitting standards”.“The company has determined it would not be prudent at this time to make the significant monetary commitments needed to preserve the option to drill in 2014,” it said in a statement.The slowdown in the US contrasts with Russia, where a number of companies are pushing ahead with plans to drill in the Arctic seas and experience minimal interference from regulators.Gazprom Neft plans to start production from its offshore Prirazlomnoye oilfield, off Russia’s northern coast, later this year, and is also expected to sign a deal with Shell in the coming days to carry out joint exploration in the Arctic offshore.Conoco spent $506m on 98 exploration leases in the Chukchi Sea in 2008, at a time of surging oil company interest in the Arctic. Shell has estimated that the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas hold some 25bn barrels of crude.Conoco went on to spend a further $144m on seismic tests, biological studies and well planning.But it is far less advanced in its Arctic programme than Shell. The Anglo-Dutch major has spent an eye-watering $5bn on its Arctic plans but has yet to complete a single well. It has faced a string of legal challenges from environmental groups as well as numerous equipment failures and objections from regulators.A Conoco spokesman said that to continue investing in the region, the company needed to be confident there was a reliable and predictable regulatory framework for the offshore Arctic.But as of today, the company lacked the regulatory approvals necessary to proceed, predictable permitting standards and a permitting schedule on which it could rely.He said the problem was that requirements on oil companies had been evolving continuously since Conoco first acquired its leases five years ago.A further hitch came earlier this year when the Department of the Interior published a review of Shell’s 2012 drilling campaign in the Arctic, which recommended that industry and government work together to develop an “Arctic-specific model for offshore oil and gas exploration in Alaska”. That could lead to new standards for drilling offshore in the region, including for maritime safety and emergency response systems.Environmentalists welcomed Conoco’s move. It was “an admission that the oil industry is still not capable of meeting the enormous challenges posed by operating in the world’s most extreme environment,” said Ben Ayliffe of Greenpeace. “The time has come for governments around the world to call for a permanent halt to the reckless exploitation of the far north.”
120;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Nigerian dealmakers open up oilfields;;Nigeria’s oil industry is increasingly a tale of two cities.Behind the high walls of their compounds in Port Harcourt, the centre of production, executives from international oil companies fret about oil theft and discuss how best to sell their assets. But in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, a new breed of homegrown and well-connected entrepreneurs gathers in hotel bars to discuss the opposite: buying opportunities.In the past five years oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, Total, ConocoPhillips and ENI of Italy have sold $5bn worth of onshore oilfields to local companies. The shift in ownership in Africa’s largest and oldest oil industry represents the first attempt by indigenous executives to tap global capital markets in order to buy part of the domestic oil industry.The transition has left an army of bankers salivating over a dealmaking boom and the potential for Nigerian oil companies to list in London and North America. The sell-off is also an opportunity for local businesses to show they can better handle the operational challenges and corruption that have bedevilled the Nigerian industry for decades, and provide more benefits to local communities.“The indigenisation process creates the potential to utilise . . . fields that would otherwise lay idle and not produce any sort of revenues for local communities,” says Joshua Holland, an Africa analyst at PFC Energy in Washington.But the risks are also high. Critics fear that Nigeria, with a long history of corruption and nepotism, could follow the path of South Africa, where policies to increase black ownership of businesses created a new oligarchy, rather than the redistribution of wealth.Finance is not the only challenge facing local Nigerian oil producers, writes Ajay Makan.The willingness of the majors to make sales in recent years has coincided with a surge in oil theft or “bunkering” as it is called locally, from onshore oil installations and pipelines.About 150,000 barrels a day are said to be lost to theft – as much as 20 per cent of onshore production – while as much again has to be shut in when companies declare force majeure and close down export pipeline systems.The result is not just lost revenue, but potentially costly liability for environmental damage.Local company executives are confident they can manage the theft issue better than the majors. Austin Avuru, the chief executive of Seplat, says: “If there is vandalism on our pipeline we will respond within 24 hours …Shell is too large for that too happen.”Mr Avuru says theft has been reduced to less than 1 per cent on the 35 km of pipeline Seplat took over from Shell when it purchased an oilfield in 2010.Other indigenous operators claim better relations with local communities, and a willingness to make more concessions to local demands than majors, without fear of setting a precedent.But theft has continued to increase despite the transfer in ownership from foreign to local companies in recent years. And that is a menace to more dealmaking because it calls into question the prices local companies have been willing to pay for onshore oilfields.“On a per barrel basis the deals [by indigenous companies] so far look quite reasonable,” said Obo Idornigie, an upstream analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “[But] oil theft has picked up massively in the last year and if it doesn’t improve we could see a discount for theft creeping into our valuations.”About a third of Nigeria’s oil production capacity of 2.5m barrels a day is located onshore, mostly in the Niger Delta swamps. Just a few years ago, international oil companies operated the vast majority. But a combination of rising oil theft, the majors’ focus on larger and more secure offshore fields and government pressure has led to a flurry of deals between oil majors and local companies.The dealmaking wave is set to gather pace if Nigeria’s long-awaited Petroleum Investment Bill is passed, defining the fiscal terms for production by local and foreign companies. “After the PIB there is the potential for a land grab in Nigeria,” says Wale Tinubu, chief executive of Oando, whose upstream subsidiary successfully bid $1.8bn for the Nigerian portfolio of ConocoPhillips in December.That prospect is creating fertile ground for alliances between international investors and well-connected local entrepreneurs.Local companies, which have sprung up almost overnight to bid for oilfields, have been deliberately structured to take advantage of the push for indigenisation.They often combine an international oil company, bringing capital and expertise, with a majority local shareholder, often with little connection to the oil industry.London-listed independents Afren and Heritage Oil hold substantial stakes in First Hydrocarbon Nigeria and Shoreline Natural Resources, two companies set up in recent years specifically to buy oilfields from Royal Dutch Shell.Labi Ogunbiyi, chief executive of FHN, says the main difficulty is not raising capital, but the competition. “If you can appeal to companies looking to break into Nigeria you can quickly get into the bidding,” he says.The presence of international companies raises questions about just how indigenous the new local companies are, and to what extent they will help spread Nigeria’s hydrocarbon wealth more widely within the country.Local operators deny they are passive shareholders providing an indigenous seal, and say that joint ventures allow for the transfer of knowledge from foreign companies. Some, such as Oando, have resisted foreign partnerships altogether.Oando has also introduced a share reward scheme, which allows hundreds of the company’s Nigerian managers to earn stock in the company, depending on performance.Mr Tinubu declares himself “very happy” with the number of middle class Oando employees, who can frequent Lagos’ growing phalanx of bars and nightclubs, a sign, he says, of “Nigeria’s growing middle class”.Closed ownership structures will also be opened up further, as the need for capital to fund more acquisitions and pressure from foreign banks such as BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered, which have provided finance to local companies, creates pressure for equity offerings.Austin Avuru, chief executive of Seplat, an indigenous operator that bought an onshore field from Shell in 2010, says an equity listing will have to follow another large acquisition.
121;COP;Conocophillips;2013-03-20T18:18:33Z;Anadarko finds ‘potentially giant’ oilfield;;Anadarko Petroleum, the US independent oil company, has discovered a “potentially giant” field in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico, one of the largest ever discovered in the region.The Shenandoah 2 appraisal well, begun in September last year, has yielded a field that could hold 500m or more barrels of oil, and may open up a new area of the gulf for oil production.The well goes 26,500 feet below the seabed in 5,800 feet of water, and the field will require a multibillion-dollar investment in production facilities. The first oil is unlikely to flow from it until late in the decade at the earliest.However, the success of Shenandoah is another sign of the resource potential of the Lower Tertiary level of rocks deep below the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico, raising hopes that it will remain an important oil producing region for many years to come.Anadarko owns 30 per cent of the well, and is the operator. ConocoPhillips also has 30 per cent and Cobalt International Energy has 20 per cent, while Marathon Oil and Venari Resources, a recent exploration start-up backed by Warburg Pincus, each have 10 per cent.Bob Daniels, Anadarko’s senior vice-president for deepwater and international exploration, highlighted evidence that the Shenandoah field had “reservoir rock and fluid properties of much higher quality than previously encountered by industry in Lower Tertiary discoveries”, meaning that the oil would be easier to extract.Brian Reinsborough, Venari’s chief executive and president, told the Financial Times that he expected Shenandoah to be “very prolific”, and “entirely different” from other deep Lower Tertiary discoveries.He added that, even after the cost of putting new production facilities in place, “we believe the finding and development costs will be very attractive, because of the volumes we have found”.Participating in a discovery of this size is a coup for Venari, which was founded less than a year ago with $1.125bn in capital, and was one of the first new entrants to the gulf after the government’s drilling moratorium following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.The Coronado well a few miles away from Shenandoah, drilled by Chevron with Conoco, Anadarko and Venari as junior partners, has also shown “very positive indications”, according to Conoco. Chevron has not yet made any formal statement on it, saying only that it expected to report results by August, but it seems likely to bring that forward.Mr Daniels said the Shenandoah Basin, where the wells have been drilled, “has the potential to become one of the most prolific new areas in the deep water Gulf of Mexico”.The success at Shenandoah is more good news for Anadarko, which has scored high-profile successes recently with large gas discoveries off the coast of Mozambique.Anadarko was a junior partner in BP’s disaster-hit Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, but continued to explore actively in the region after the moratorium was lifted in 2010. It expects to drill six to eight wells there this year.Shares in Anadarko rose 3.7 per cent to $86.39 in midday trading in New York.
122;COP;Conocophillips;2013-03-04T19:21:18Z;Hess plans shake-up to deflect pressure;;Hess has announced a radical restructuring plan, including disposals, an increased dividend and a shake-up of its board, as the oil group’s management seeks to deflect pressure for change from Elliott Management, the hedge fund.Hess plans to offload its fuel stations, oil marketing and energy trading business, it said on Monday, to focus on being a pure oil and gas exploration company.It has also proposed to nominate six new directors, including former senior executives of General Electric, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP, to address concerns that the board was not sufficiently independent from John Hess, the chief executive, and lacked relevant experience.Mr Hess, son of the company’s founder Leon Hess, controls 10.25 per cent of the shares.Elliott revealed in January it controlled 4 per cent of the shares, and called for a break-up of the company, which it said could realise value up to twice Hess’s then market capitalisation. Hess shares rose 3.5 per cent to $68.86 by lunchtime in New York, valuing the group at more than $23bn.Elliott has proposed the election of five new directors to the Hess board, including Harvey Golub, credited with the turnround of American Express in the 1990s, and Rodney Chase, a former deputy chief executive of BP.Relational Investors, a hedge fund which has 3.25 per cent of Hess, said it backed Elliott’s plan.Hess is one of the most active companies in the Bakken shale of North Dakota, the heart of the new US oil boom, but for a long time its shares did not reflect the strength of that position, falling over four years, while, on average, exploration and production companies’ share prices rose strongly.In a letter to shareholders, however, Mr Hess said the shares had risen 34 per cent between July of last year and the day Elliott’s interest in the company was revealed.Speaking to the Financial Times, Mr Hess said the strategy to refocus the company as an exploration and production business, which will have assets in North Dakota, Ohio, Malaysia, Ghana and the Gulf of Mexico, had been set back in 2010.“This is not a response to an activist. It’s a very thought-out and deliberate response that the management has put in place to maximise value for shareholders,” he said.The suggestion from Elliott that the Bakken assets could be spun off would be damaging in terms of tax consequences and the financial strength of the two companies it would create, he added.The new directors proposed by Hess include John Krenicki, the former head of GE’s energy business, and Mark Williams, former head of refining and marketing for Shell.Mr Hess said: “The fact that we were able to attract six world-class leaders shows …how they believe and support the strategy we have.”Hess plans to offload the Hess Energy Trading Company joint venture it founded with two former Goldman Sachs partners in 1997. Hess has lost money in trading in four of the past five years.In other moves intended to increase its appeal to shareholders, the company said it expected production growth from its continuing businesses to average 5-8 per cent per year for five years.It also said it planned a $1 per share annual dividend, to be paid in the third quarter, and would secure authorisation from the board to buy back up to $4bn of stock.Elliott said Hess had adopted parts of the plan it proposed in May, but the restructuring plan fell “dramatically short of what is needed”.Realising greater value from Hess required “truly independent directors that can hold management accountable and ensure they follow through”.Elliott added: “Partial refocusing of the company, partial awakening to the need for capital stewardship, and partial improvement of a minority of directors is a long way away from recouping nearly two decades of destroyed value to shareholders.”The company’s annual meeting has been set for May 16.
123;COP;Conocophillips;2013-02-25T07:46:22Z;Chevron adds heft to Australian shale;;"Australia’s fledging unconventional gas industry received a big vote of confidence on Monday when Chevron, the second-biggest oil company in the US, agreed to pay up to $349m for stakes in two shale prospects being developed by Adelaide-based Beach Energy.Chevron is the latest international energy company to invest in Australia’s emerging shale gas sector. Earlier this month, PetroChina announced a deal with ConocoPhillips to explore for gas in Western Australia, which is estimated to have the fifth-largest reserves of shale gas in the world, according to the US Energy Information Agency.In total, international and domestic oil exploration groups are planning to spend more than A$1bn ($1.02bn) over the next couple of years on drilling and testing Australia’s shale reserves. There could be almost 400tn cubic feet (tcf) of shale reserves in Australia as well as 20 tcf of tight gas, another unconventional natural gas, according to Geoscience Australia. To put those figures into perspective, Australia’s annual domestic gas usage is 1 tcf.The global boom in oil and gas production unleashed by new shale drilling techniques has been a blessing for the US economy, creating thousands of new jobs and reducing the country’s dependence on crude oil imports.Many wonder if the same could happen in Australia, but the extent to which its unconventional gas resources can be profitably developed is not yet clear. In last year’s Energy White Paper, the Australian government noted the country’s shale resources were lower in liquids, including more profitable crude oil, than the US because of different geology and with one notable exception would require “costly new infrastructure to develop”.That exception is the Cooper Basin, which straddles the borders of South Australia and Queensland and has produced conventional oil and gas since the 1960s.“We’ve had thousands of wells in the Cooper,” says Barry Goldstein, the South Australian government’s executive director of Energy Resources. “We know what the rocks are and we have infrastructure overlying all of these shales for the conventional oil and gas. It’s a skip and a jump to connect to processing facilities and pipelines to get it to market.”Australian oil and gas company Santos has already started producing shale gas from one well in the Cooper basin and is actively searching for more.According to the EIA, the Cooper Basin could yield 85 tcf of gas – or 85 years of domestic supply based on current consumption.“The Cooper Basin is a huge potential resource,” says Reg Nelson, managing director of Beach Energy. “This is ground breaking; this is nation building.”Its development is also important for the economy in the state of South Australia, which is searching for other drivers of growth after BHP Billiton ditched plans for a A$20bn expansion of its Olympic Dam mine last year.Analysts say the deal between Beach and Chevron, which has significant shale gas assets in the US and Canada, is vindication of the Cooper Basin’s potential. Chevron is already one of the biggest foreign investors in Australia but until now it has been focused on large conventional gas ventures, such as its A$52bn Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia.But it will be another 12-18 months of drilling before Beach and other explorers such as Santos will know if unconventional gas can be produced commercially from the Cooper Basin.“People always ask me what price is needed to make the Cooper viable,” says Mr Nelson. “And the answer is we won’t know until we have determined the initial flow rates and the decline curve. Once we know those will be able to determine prices.”"
124;COP;Conocophillips;2013-02-17T08:21:07Z;Conoco allowed to restart Penglai block;;The Chinese government has allowed ConocoPhillips to restart production at an oilfield off the country’s Northeastern coast suspended after a spill in 2011.The green light ends a record 17-month shutdown, which highlighted the industry’s risks in China as the government is under pressure to demonstrate tougher supervision in the face of growing public environmental awareness.“Following a series of corrective measures including draining and pressure relief and maintenance, the Penglai 19-3 block has returned to normal conditions and fulfils the conditions for normal operations. The State Oceanic Administration agrees to allow Conoco to gradually implement operations related to resuming production,” the agency said.Regulators had ordered the shutdown in reaction to what ranks as a relatively small leak compared with offshore spills in other countries. Leaks at two different sites in June 2011 caused 700 barrels of oil and 2,500 barrels of drilling mud to spill into the ocean, according to the company.Initially the government ordered only those two platforms shut, but ordered the suspension of production at the entire block two months later. The project is jointly owned by Conoco and China’s state-owned Cnooc and run by Conoco. Penglai is Cnooc’s largest offshore field.China issued its biggest fine for oil spill pollution as a result, asking for Rmb1.7bn ($269m) from Conoco and Cnooc in compensation for environmental damage caused by oil seepage.At 17 months, the suspension lasted much longer than initial estimates of about 6 months. At the time, the government required ConocoPhillips to submit a new development plan for the block. Last month, the government said the National Development and Reform Commission, the country’s chief economic planner, had approved this new plan.The State Oceanic Administration called on Cnooc to “continue to supervise and assist ConocoPhillips” in implementing the environmental requirements of the new development plan.
125;COP;Conocophillips;2013-02-01T17:42:34Z;Oil companies: earnings, schmearnings;High price per barrel on its own will not rescue profitability;"Big Oil is upstream with a broken paddle. The most striking feature of the 2012 results announced so far by the world’s biggest oil companies is the sluggishness of their upstream operations – the bits that explore for, extract and ship oil and gas. Even America’s mighty ExxonMobil is struggling. Its 2012 earnings report on Friday showed its upstream earnings were 13 per cent down on 2011. Chevron’s were down 4 per cent, while ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum saw falls of about 15 per cent. Shell’s were flat. Given the strength of the oil price, that may seem odd.The problem is volume. Companies generally failed to produce more oil and gas in 2012 than they did in 2011; in some cases production was down. Exxon’s was nearly 6 per cent lower, Occidental’s was up about 5 per cent and most others had a flat year. (BP and a handful of other big groups have yet to report 2012 numbers.) Moreover, the near-term outlook is not much better. ConocoPhillips says its 2013 production is likely to be about 1.5m barrels of oil equivalent a day, a shade lower than 2012 and 2011.Countering these trends will be tough. It is a question not just of production but of productivity. The fact is it costs more to get oil out of mature, declining wells than out of newer ones. Exploration costs and capital expenditures are rising so returns on investment are falling. Chevron’s return on capital employed fell from 22 per cent in 2011 to less than 19 per cent last year; ConocoPhillips saw its returns decline from 13 per cent to 11 per cent.Oil companies need more than a high oil price if they want to reverse the trend of falling profitability. Expensive exploration plays will need to succeed too. This is where the going is toughest and where the toughest get going. In the end, everything flows from upstream.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
126;COP;Conocophillips;2013-01-31T08:02:59Z;ConocoPhillips hit by falling prices;;ConocoPhillips, the US oil and gas exploration and production company, reported a 7 per cent drop in underlying earnings per share last year as a result of the fall in prices for natural gas and Canadian heavy oil.Its results and those of Phillips 66, the refining, pipelines and chemicals business spun off from Conoco last May, showed contrasting effects from the boom in US shale oil and gas.Surging US production has driven down natural gas prices and opened a gap between prices for oil inland in the US and internationally traded crude. Those are trends that help the profitability of Phillips 66’s refineries and chemicals plants, which use oil and gas as inputs.However, the fall in North American gas prices, and particularly in natural gas liquids such as ethane used as chemical feedstocks, has hurt Conoco’s revenues.Conoco’s underlying net income, excluding discontinued businesses, fell 16 per cent to $6.73bn for 2012. Phillips 66, which published its results earlier on Wednesday, reported a 50 per cent rise in its underlying net income to $5.39bn.Earnings from Phillips 66’s chemicals operations, mostly shared in a 50/50 venture with Chevron, were up 37 per cent at $980m, while earnings from its refineries almost doubled, from an underlying $1.98bn to $3.79bnGreg Garland, Phillips 66 chief executive, said the company was now using “advantaged crude” – lower-priced supplies from the US and Canada – for 67 per cent of the oil running through its US refineries in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from 57 per cent in the equivalent period of 2011.The company suggested that proportion could rise by a further 5-10 percentage points in a year’s time. For Conoco, the average selling price of its crude oil during 2012 was up 20 cents per barrel over the previous year at $105.72, but the average price of its bitumen – heavy oil from the tar sands of Canada – was down $8.65 per barrel at $53.91.Prices for western Canadian heavy oil, including bitumen from the tar sands province of Alberta, have been even weaker than inland US crude, because of congestion on pipelines carrying the oil to US markets. Conoco’s natural gas selling price was also down, by 6 per cent, and its natural gas liquids were down 17 per cent.The impact of lower prices was compounded by a fall in Conoco’s production. Oil and gas output for the full year was up about 0.5 per cent for continuing operations, excluding the effect of disposals, at 1.527m barrels per day of oil equivalent.That fell short of the company’s target of average production growth of 3-5 per cent a year out to 2016. This year is likely also to fall short of that goal, the company said, with an expected decline to 1.475m-1.525m boe/d from continuing operations for 2013. However, Ryan Lance, Conoco’s chief executive, said the company was still committed to its volume growth goal.He added that the company had made good progress with its disposal programme, raising $2.1bn from asset sales last year, and having agreed deals to sell assets in Algeria, Nigeria and the US, as well as its stake in the giant Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, to raise a total of a further $9.6bn.Conoco’s earnings, released after US markets closed on Wednesday, were slightly ahead of the average of analysts’ expectations, but the shares lost almost 1 per cent to $61.09 in after-hours trading.In the past six months, Conoco’s shares have risen 11 per cent, while Phillips 66 is up 59 per cent.
127;COP;Conocophillips;2013-01-29T18:58:37Z;US gasoline prices peak on refinery news;;US wholesale gasoline prices hit a three-month high after Hess Corporation on Monday said it will next month close a refinery at Port Reading, New Jersey, that supplies gasoline to the New York market.Nymex February RBOB gasoline futures climbed 1.4 per cent on Tuesday to a session high of $2.9741 per gallon shortly before midday in New York, as traders factored in the imminent reduction of supply.Gasoline futures have risen 3.5 per cent since the Hess announcement to the highest level since mid October. The rise in gasoline prices also helped to drive crude oil prices higher. ICE March Brent rose to an intraday peak of $114.49 a barrel, the highest in three months. Nymex March WTI rose to $97.82 a barrel.“The Hess refinery closure, and particularly the short notice, has taken the market by surprise,” said Gareth Lewis-Davies, a commodity strategist at BNP Paribas.The price of European gasoline, which is not traded on exchange, also climbed according to market participants, in anticipation of European refiners meeting some of the shorfall in demand in the north-east region of the US.The closure of the Hess Port Reading refinery is the latest in a string of big oil company announcements of plans to sell or close their refineries in the US East coast. Last year, Delta Air Lines purchased the 185,000 b/d Trainer refinery outside Philadelphia from Phillips 66, the refining business spun off from ConocoPhillips, as it sought to hedge its rising jet fuel costs.Hess has also shut down a big refining centre in the Caribbean, further straining gasoline supplies to the US.Although Hess’s Port Reading refinery produces only about 50,000 barrels a day of gasoline, it is critical for the supply of the New York area and thus has an outsize impact on the energy futures market of the city. The shortfall in gasoline in the New York area is not expected to be met from mid-western refineries, because pipelines flowing from the midwest to the New York area are running at capacity.Gasoline, or products for blending gasoline, could also be shipped to the New York region from refineries on the US Gulf Coast, but imports from Europe may be cheaper, analysts said.Shipments of crude and oil products within the US must be made by US-owned, crewed and flagged ships, increasing transport costs. European refineries produce more gasoline than is consumed on the continent, in part because demand in Europe has shifted towards diesel.The traditional simple measure of gasoline refining margins, known as the RBOB crack spread, has climbed $27 from $25 a barrel since the Hess announcement on Monday.
128;COP;Conocophillips;2013-01-28T23:42:44Z;Fracking: Industry faces up to hurdle of water pollution;These are, potentially, exciting times for companies that can reduce the environmental risks and the waste, reports Ed Crooks;The recent feature film sounding the alarm about the US natural gas boom, Promised Land, opens with its star Matt Damon washing his face in a bathroom. The film sets out its theme from the start: the greatest source of concern about the extraction of gas from rocks is water pollution.The use of water mixed with sand and chemicals in hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”, has made the shale oil and gas boom possible.The demand for that water – and the disposal of the produced water that emerges from wells after they have been fracked – are at the heart of the debate over whether tighter controls should be imposed on the industry.They are also potentially exciting opportunities for companies that have ways to manage water that are economically efficient and reduce the environmental risks.“Everybody is relying on fracking to make the US more energy independent, but there are major issues with water,” says Riggs Eckelberry, the chief executive of OriginOil, a company that has recently entered the business of water treatment for the oil and gas industry.He adds: “It’s becoming critical to the entire US strategy to do something about this water.”Dennis Danzik, a director of Ridgeline Energy Services, another small company that has been developing water treatment technology, agrees.He says: “Eventually, we’ll need a full waste water treatment policy, or we’ll have the country dotted with quarter-acre ponds. We have to have the energy, so the issue is not going to go away. It has to be dealt with.”A typical deep shale gas well needs 4m-6m gallons of water for hydraulic fracturing, according to a 2011 report from the National Petroleum Council, an advisory group to the US government that includes both industry representatives and environmentalists.That does not make the industry a particularly large user of water. As gas companies like to point out, in terms of water use per unit of energy produced, shale production compares very favourably to other sources such as coal or gas-fired power generation.In some parts of the US, however, water use can be a problem, especially during the drought conditions that have hit much of the country over the past year.Scott Anderson, of the Environmental Defense Fund, who has worked on the issue for the NPC, says there are some counties in Texas where 70 per cent of the growth in water consumption is a result of oil and gas production.Even in states where water is plentiful, it needs to be transported to wells, adding cost and creating disruption for communities that will be plagued by streams of trucks.The more serious problem, however, is the disposal of waste water that emerges with the oil and gas. It includes “flow back” fracking water – between 10 per cent and 70 per cent of water used for fracking comes back out again, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.That water, contaminated with salt and the chemicals used for fracking, needs to be managed. It is generally either pumped into injection wells or sent to plants for treatment.Neither method is ideal. Injection wells have been blamed for causing small earthquakes in Texas and other states, and there have been warnings that in some areas the volume of waste water needing to be stored will overwhelm the available capacity. Standard water treatment plants are not able to handle all the substances in flow back water. In 2010-11 Pennsylvania moved to limit the levels of pollution in waste water that gas producers were able to send to the state’s treatment facilities. Plants were also compelled to monitor for radioactive radium and uranium, which can be present in produced water.The solution for many companies is to treat and reuse water close to the well-site. More companies now offer water treatment technology, including big engineering groups such as General Electric and Siemens, oilfield specialists such as Halliburton, and smaller businesses such as Ecosphere.OriginOil was a specialist in technology for processing algae for biofuel production, but spotted an opportunity in fracking water treatment. It says its process, which it will demonstrate in Texas, will remove 98 per cent of carbon contaminants from waste water.Some processes can be expensive, but Mr Eckelberry says OriginOil’s system, used with further processing, can treat water for as little as 7 cents per gallon, less than the 21-26 cents of other methods and less even than the 11 cents typical cost of a gallon delivered to the well-site by truck.Ridgeline, meanwhile, has reached the point of selling its services to oil and gas producers, including ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources and Devon Energy.Mr Danzik suggests a cost of 1-8 cents per gallon for its electro-catalytic process, compared to about 22-24 cents for rival methods.He also argues that the use of water treatment will have to be much more widespread. Government regulation may also play a part. With the EPA studying the impact of fracking on water resources – its report is due late next year – the industry could face tighter curbs.“Technology can help, but technology alone isn’t a solution,” says Evan Branosky, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank. “We need to better understand the full water risks to inform smart decisions for responsible development of shale gas.”

While Apple still remains the most valuable company on the S&P 500 index, its market weight has dropped from more than 4 per cent at its peak last September to 3.5 per cent, only marginally larger than that of Exxon.Some analysts, however, remained optimistic about the company: “Despite a litany of component cut rumours, we expect strong quarterly results, and are actually raising our fourth-quarter iPhone forecast slightly,” said Will Power, senior analyst at Baird.Apple is due to report its quarterly results next week, with analysts estimating a 3 per cent decline in earnings, according to FactSet.Overall, US markets rebounded from their session lows and closed higher yesterday as investors digested a batch of mixed economic data and awaited earnings from major banks.Retail sales rose in December as US consumers showed resilience during the holiday shopping season, while producer prices fell in December.However, manufacturing in the New York region contracted in January for the sixth straight month as fiscal cliff concerns weighed on businesses, which delayed capital investments.The benchmark S&P 500 index regained its five-year high level, closing 0.1 per cent higher at 1,472.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2 per cent to 13,534.89. However, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.2 per cent to 3,110.78.“Markets did not pay much attention to today’s positive retail sales and producer price index numbers, even though they indicate that consumers are stronger than previously thought,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.“While positive retail sales numbers gave some support to retail stocks yesterday, markets had already priced in a strong holiday shopping season, as seen in the impressive rally in the sector in 2012,” she added.A larger than expected rise in retail sales lifted retail sector stocks, with the S&P 500 retail index up 1 per cent.The biggest winners were clothes retailers Gap and Ross Stores, which operates discount retail clothing and home fashion stores across the US. Shares in Gap rose 3.4 per cent to $32.46 while Ross Stores added 3.1 per cent to $58.00.Facebook shares closed sharply lower after the largest social network by members announced a new search feature at a media event at its headquarters yesterday. Shares were down 2.7 per cent to $30.10 after a volatile session earlier.Dell shares soared again, up 7.2 per cent higher to $13.17 after news reports on Monday that the PC maker was in talks to be bought out by private equity firms. The stock jumped 13 per cent during the previous session amid high volumes.In earnings news, Lennar reported a surge in fourth-quarter earnings, beating analysts expectations.However, the shares took a 0.8 per cent hit to $40.68 as earnings were boosted by a $18.6m one-off tax benefit.In deal news, Denbury Resources agreed to buy oilfields in North Dakota and Montana from ConocoPhillips for $1.05bn in cash. Shares in Denbury Resources rose 5.2 per cent to $17.76, while ConocoPhillips shares were 0.9 per cent higher at $59.03.Research In Motion shares fell 3.1 per cent to $14.48, giving up some gains from Monday’s 10 per cent rally.
130;COP;Conocophillips;2013-01-11T14:36:59Z;Gas users call for limits on LNG exports;;Large US natural gas users, including Dow Chemical, Alcoa, the aluminium company, and Nucor, the steelmaker, have formed an alliance to campaign for limits on the country’s exports of liquefied natural gas.The group, called America’s Energy Advantage, says it plans to “educate policy makers on the potential risks to the US economy of unfettered natural gas exports”.Its members fear that US gas prices, which have plunged over the past five years as a result of the shale revolution, could be driven higher by demand from foreign buyers.LNG cargoes in Asia are selling for about four times the US benchmark gas price of about $3.20 a million British thermal units.The increasingly vocal campaign for curbs on LNG exports has made Dow and other chemical companies unlikely allies of environmental campaigners worried about pollution from shale gas production. They are pitted against companies such as BG Group, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Dominion, which are involved in projects to build plants to liquefy gas for export.The US administration has indicated it is willing to allow increased gas exports, but political opposition is mounting.Only one company, Cheniere Energy, has so far been awarded a licence to export gas to countries with which the US does not have a free-trade agreement, but applications for 15 more proposed developments have been filed at the Department of Energy.If they were all built, they would have capacity to export 24.8bn cubic feet a day, about a third of total US gas production.Last month, a study commissioned by the energy department from NERA Economic Consulting concluded that unrestricted gas exports would push up US gas prices by, at most, $1.11 per mBTU after five years, and there would be a net benefit for the US economy worth $5bn-$47bn in 2020.The department responded by saying it planned to go ahead with considering exports licence applications on a “case by case” basis.The NERA study was criticised by Dow and its allies at America’s Energy Advantage for failing to take sufficient account of the surge in investment in chemicals and manufacturing resulting from the shale boom. They say more jobs and income could be created in the US by keeping the gas at home as a cheap input for other industries.However, Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry lobby group, said efforts to restrict LNG exports were “misguided”.“Short-sighted efforts by a few industrial users to restrict exports in an apparent attempt to control prices would deprive American families of the wider benefits of lower costs and increased job creation,” he said in a statement. “Restricting exports of energy as a ‘strategic resource’ makes no more sense than unnecessarily restricting the export of chemicals, agriculture products or cars, and such a backward move could violate international trade rules.”A recent report by NERA Economic Consulting for the energy department concluded that allowing LNG exports would be a net benefit for the US economy and could boost gross domestic product by $5bn-$47bn.But the issue is politically sensitive, with some lawmakers on Capitol Hill considering energy exports a threat to the US’s national security, while others say that exporting gas would lead to price increases at home that would hurt manufacturers and homeowners.Ron Wyden, the incoming chairman of the Senate’s energy committee, on Thursday called for the NERA report findings into question.“Although the NERA study acknowledges that some sectors of the economy will be hurt by exports, the NERA study fails to fully assess the impacts of rising natural gas prices on homeowners and businesses,” Mr Wyden wrote in a letter to Steven Chu, the energy secretary.The report used data that was two years old that understated demand and did not account for the amount of natural gas used at export terminals. “The shortcomings of the NERA study are numerous and render this study insufficient for the department to use in any export determination,” he said in the letter.
131;COP;Conocophillips;2013-01-07T15:15:23Z;Arctic drilling: cold feet;Risks of hostile environments are becoming clear;"Cold, wet and windy in those Alaska waters. An accident involving Shell’s Kulluk oil drilling rig over the New Year has set alarm bells ringing about environmental damage in a pristine region. Fair enough: after the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico, oil exploration is under intense scrutiny. The rig was heading to Seattle for maintenance when it came adrift in fierce winds; it was refloated late on Sunday. The incident raises an important question for oil companies hunting for the next Prudhoe Bay: is their technology up to it? So far, the answer appears to be no.Alaska is a huge source of oil and gas: BP claims to be the region’s biggest producer. Prudhoe Bay, a 25bn-barrel field discovered in 1968, put it on the map: it is the largest oilfield in the US, producing more than 500,000 barrels a day. The US government estimates that there are 27bn barrels of oil and 130tn cubic feet of gas offshore Alaska. So the hunt for another Prudhoe Bay goes on. There lies the catch. Production at Prudhoe Bay is mostly onshore: its fields are less exposed to the predations of the weather than those out at sea under the waves.Shell has spent $4.5bn pursuing Alaskan exploration over the past few years and was expecting to begin drilling in July. It has already taken six years to get to this point, after delays due to environmental, regulatory and technical problems.The outlay needs to be seen in context – Shell spends about $8bn a quarter on capital investment. But the risks of drilling in such hostile environments are becoming clear. Cairn Energy has spent $1bn drilling unsuccessfully off Greenland. The main operators in Alaska are the big boys (ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron alongside BP), so deep pockets prevail. But only technology can reduce the risks. Until it is developed further, there is no need to rush into such stormy waters.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
132;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
133;COP;Conocophillips;2012-12-18T20:27:37Z;Conoco to sell Algerian unit to Pertamina;;US oil producer ConocoPhillips said it was selling its Algerian business unit to Indonesia’s state-owned oil company Pertamina for $1.75bn, part of an ongoing shake-up of its asset portfolio.The unit holds stakes in three big onshore oilfields, which delivered net production to Conoco of 11,000 barrels of oil a day this year.The company said the deal, which is expected to close by mid-2013, was subject to Algerian government approval and a green light from its partners in the fields.Conoco, the third-largest US oil company by production, is in the middle of a big asset disposal programme that is expected to net about $7bn when completed. It is designed to sharpen Conoco’s focus on assets that deliver growth in production and cash margins, and improve returns on capital.Last month it announced the $5bn sale of its stake in Kashagan, a huge oilfield in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea.Conoco spun off its refining, pipelines and chemicals business into a separate company, Phillips 66, earlier this year.“The sale of our Algerian business unit represents another important step in transforming ConocoPhillips’ asset base, and advances the strategic interests of both Pertamina and ConocoPhillips,” said Don Wallette, Conoco’s executive vice-president of business development and corporate planning.Conoco’s shares were up 1 per cent at $58.88 in New York trading on Tuesday morning.

RBS estimates this week’s issuance may reach $25bn.The rush of new sales is coming after a strong performance in November. The month became the largest of the year for total corporate issuance, with sales of $135bn.Companies are now trying to squeeze in as many debt sales as possible in coming days ahead of an expected slowdown in activity later this month during the holiday season.Analysts said large corporate borrowers were also trying to beat a potential sell-off in markets at the start of January if US policy makers fail to reach a compromise on budget talks and avert the looming fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts.“There are really only about two good weeks of new issuance left in December,” said Ed Marrinan, head of macro credit strategy at RBS Securities.“Comments on the fiscal cliff are still likely to cause hiccups in risk assets in general, though we do not expect a deal to be reached until later in the year as the deadline approaches.”The combination of record low borrowing costs and strong demand for higher yielding alternatives to top-tier government bonds has pushed corporate debt sales in the US to their highest level on record, according to data tracker Dealogic.Global corporations took advantage of the sweet spot and have sold $1.1tn bonds so far this year.“Why not sell more bonds if you can?” said Adrian Miller, a director of fixed-income strategy at GMP Securities.“With rates at these low levels, the holiday season coming, and lack of definition on the fiscal cliff front . . . many companies just simply don’t want to wait. They will try to lock in funds at the lowest possible cost,” he added.Mr Miller said demand for the bonds was likely to remain high in spite of the flood of new debt sales as returns on the securities far outpaced those of government bonds.Average total returns year-to-date on US investment grade corporate bonds stood at 10 per cent on Wednesday, while those on US Treasuries were at 2.4 per cent, according to Barclays indices.Returns on US high-yield debt were even higher, at 14.3 per cent.
135;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ONGC’s questionable Kazakh buy;;"On the face of it, ONGC‘s decision to splash out $5bn on a minority share in the giant Kashagan oil field in Kazakhstan makes sense, given the Indian national oil company’s pressing need to build up strategic oil reserves. But analysts dissecting the company’s most expensive ever overseas acquisition say the deal is fraught with risk and smacks of desperation.ONGC announced plans this week to pay $5bn for an 8.4 per cent stake in Kashagan from ConocoPhillips, which is exiting the project in its efforts to shed debt.Kashagan is one of the last of the world’s so called “elephant” oil fields, capable of making a significant impact on global energy security. It holds 38bn barrels of reserves of which 13bn barrels are proved to be recoverable. But it is also hugely difficult, dangerous and expensive to develop.However, the most immediate risk for ONGC is that it has spent time and resources negotiating a deal that may end up in the bin. Even as the announcement was made, Kazakhstan said it was considering exercising its right to buy ConocoPhillips’ share in Kashagan itself and would need up to six months to mull over the matter.Assuming that things go ONGC’s way, the Indian company will begin work at Kashagan in early 2013, just as the first phase of the development begins pumping oil. While its new partners including Exxon, Shell, Total and Italy’s Eni have been bickering for years over operator rights, technical risks and ballooning costs, the Indian company will arrive just as the champagne corks pop and the group sees the first return on the estimated $47bn piled into the project so far.In a statement ONGC said it was likely to receive an average 20,000 b/d of oil for 25 years from Phase 1 with a peak of about 32,000b/d. That sounds good, but it’s a drop in the ocean compared to ONGC’s goal to boost oil production more than tenfold by 2030 to 1.2m b/d.For Kashagan to make a sizeable impact on Indian energy security, it will be essential for phase two and three of the project to go ahead, which are designed to boost production at the field to 1.5m b/d.Before that happens, foreign oil majors will have to settle their latest dispute with Kazakhstan, which has balked at the estimated $100bn cost of the project’s expansion. For their part the oil majors are demanding that the government extends the lifetime of the Kashagan contract to give them more time to recover their investment.Welcoming the deal with ONGC this week, ConocoPhillips said it was pleased that the Indian company “recognizes the value of the (Kashagan) asset.”Analysts however have questioned the arithmetic.CreditSuisse for one, valued the 8.4 per cent of Kashagan at $3.5bn without building the uncertain second and third phases of the project into its price model. “ONGC’s purchase price of $5bn therefore implies it has paid a large part of Phase 2 valuations upfront, which is still to be de-risked,” the bank said in a note.If the deal goes through, Kashagan will be ONGC’s third acquisition in the Caspian Sea in less than two years. In 2011 it joined forces to explore a large block in the Caspian with KazMunaigas, the Kazakh state oil company. There are no results yet, but then it’s still early days.In Azerbaijan, ONGC bought a 2.72 per cent stake in the BP-operated Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli deep water project this year from Hess of the US. It also bought a small interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan export pipeline that links the Caspian with the Turkish Mediterranean.With production of more than 700,000 b/d, ACG is by far Azerbaijan’s biggest oil project. However, ONGC has joined a bit late in the day. More than a decade after coming on stream, the field is expected to go into decline in the next few years.The spate of Caspian acquisitions shows that ONGC “is really serious about getting into the region,” says Julia Nanay, senior director at PFC, the Washington DC-based energy consultancy.Offering an explanation for ONGC’s choice of assets, Nanay says the main priority of national oil companies is to obtain equity oil. They are less fixated than privately owned oil majors on high rates of return.A test of the majors’ confidence in the future of Kashagan will come if any of the partners decide to pre-empt the ONGC acquisition and buy out ConocoPhillips themselves. So far they have not reacted publicly to the deal. “Maybe ONGC sees something in Kashagan that other shareholders do not,” says Edward Chow, senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.Related reading:

137;COP;Conocophillips;2012-11-26T17:59:43Z;Conoco sells stake in Kashagan field;;ConocoPhillips, the US oil and gas group, has agreed to sell its 8.4 per cent stake in the giant Kashagan field in Kazakhstan to ONGC of India for about $5bn, in the latest shake-up at one of the world’s largest oil projects.Kashagan, in the northern Caspian Sea, is one of the largest oil discoveries of the past four decades, but its development has been plagued with delays and cost overruns.Conoco is selling out for a loss of about $500m on the book value of its stake and will take a post-tax charge of about $400m in the fourth quarter.Royal Dutch Shell, Eni of Italy, Total of France and ExxonMobil of the US each have 16.8 per cent of Kashagan, as does KazMunaiGaz, Kazakhstan’s national oil company.The field, discovered in 2000, had been expected to start production in 2005, but is now scheduled to come on stream in the first half of next year, at a cost of $46bn. Harsh winter conditions and high levels of toxic hydrogen sulphide in the oil have made it a challenging development, and there have been management missteps and disputes between the project partners.Initial production is expected to be 370,000 barrels per day, with potential to increase that if there is further investment.Eni was the operator leading the Kashagan project until 2008, when after increasingly acrimonious negotiations with the Kazakh government the newly created North Caspian Operating Company, jointly owned by all the consortium members, was formed to take over responsibility. At the same time, KazMunaiGaz doubled its stake in the project, with its partners reducing their stakes on a pro-rata basis.Shell will have an enhanced role as operator of production when the project starts up next year, and has been discussing possible further expansion.Simon Henry, its chief financial officer, said earlier this month that production could rise to more than 1m b/d, but pointed out that a previous expansion plan had been halted 18 months ago.He said that development had been stopped “because the fiscal environment for the project and the government as we saw it did not support continuing with what would basically be a massive industry investment”.He added: “Until we see those issues resolved, the project will basically only develop a very small proportion of its potential.”Conoco, the third-largest US oil and gas group by production, is undergoing radical restructuring to focus its operations and improve shareholder returns. It has been divesting assets such as its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil of Russia, sold in 2010-2011. In May, it split off its refining, chemicals and pipeline operations into a new company, Phillips 66.Its expansion plans are now focused on a small number of regions around the world, principally in developed economies including the US, Australia and Norway.The Kashagan stake sale would bring Conoco’s total proceeds from disposals announced this year to about $7bn, taking it most of the way towards its target of raising $8bn-$10bn from asset sales in 2012-2013.For ONGC, which is 79 per cent owned by the Indian government, the entry into Kazakhstan fulfils a long-held ambition. It was in talks with Exxon last year about buying the US company’s stake, along with Indian Oil Corporation, another state-controlled group, but the negotiations did not result in a deal.
138;COP;Conocophillips;2012-10-31T23:04:32Z;N American crude drives Phillips 66;;Phillips 66, the refining, pipelines and chemicals company split off from ConocoPhillips in May, has raised its profits by increasing the proportion of lower-priced North American crude oil that it runs in its refineries, and plans further increases in future years.Its 24 per cent rise in underlying net earnings to $1.89bn for the third quarter of 2012 was helped by a $250m benefit from using cheaper oil, in another sign of the boost to the US energy industry created by the boom in production of shale oil from states such as North Dakota and Texas and rising output from the oil sands of western Canada.Phillips has raised the proportion of what it calls “advantaged” crude, including heavy oil, bitumen from the Canadian tar sands, and US shale oil, from an average of 52 per cent of the oil processed at its refineries last year to 63 per cent in the third quarter of 2012.Greg Maxwell, chief financial officer, said he thought the company could raise that to 80 per cent of its North American refining capacity of 1.8m barrels per day over the next few years.Phillips been making efforts to secure more lower-cost crude, for example placing an order for 2,000 rail cars to carry oil from North Dakota to refineries on the east and west coasts of the US, on routes that have no pipeline connections.The boom in US shale oil production, and expected continued growth from Canadian oil sands, means that Phillips believes that in a few years 80 per cent of the crude run through its North American refineries could have some cost advantage.Strong North American oil production and bottlenecks in transport routes have created a wide price difference between internationally traded Brent crude oil and domestic US West Texas Intermediate.However, Phillips believes that gap is likely to shrink as more pipeline connections are built, closing from about $22 per barrel today to just $5-$7 per barrel.The boost from using cheaper crude helped Phillips beat analysts’ expectations with earnings of $2.97 per share, excluding one-off costs.The dividend was raised 25 per cent to 25 cents per share.Phillips also said it had no reports of any injuries at Bayway, its New Jersey refinery, from the storm Sandy.The 238,000 b/d refinery, which was shut down before the storm, suffered “some flooding in low-lying areas”, Mr Maxwell said, and the company could give no indication as to when it would restart.
139;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Somaliland: oil first, recognition later;;"It’s not a country recognised by anyone other than its own government, but that doesn’t seem to phase three oil companies scaling up exploration in Somaliland.UK-listed Genel Energy and Ophir Energy, and Australia-listed Jacka Resources, are starting to explore for oil in earnest in the breakaway state, which declared independence from Somalia in 1991.“We are embarking on the largest and most significant exploration this country has seen since it became independent 21 years ago,” oil minister Hussein Abdi Dualeh told beyondbrics from an oil conference in South Africa, hopeful the first drilling will start in 2014 following seismic surveys this year. “They are starting in a major way – it’s going to be a massive year.”The three explorers cover seven blocks between them and Dualeh insists they have nothing to fear from old claims on some of the blocks issued under the former Mogadishu administration before it collapsed.“The old companies from way back when Somalia was together have long gone. These contracts don’t last forever, they are long expired. I’m not worried they’ll have problems – I have no idea who had what,” says Dualeh. “We have had full control of the territory for 21 years. We have stability and access to the port – we have what any investor would like to have.”Under the former Somalia regime, oil blocks were previously concessioned to Chevron, BP and Conoco before they declared force majeure more than 20 years ago when the state collapsed. A new donor-backed government in Mogadishu faces pressing concerns such as fighting al-Shabaab Islamist militants, holding off piracy and establishing a nationwide administration in the failed state.The new explorers are no strangers to disputed and semi-autonomous states. UK’s FTSE-listed Ophir Energy, which owns 75 per cent of two Somaliland blocks, also has assets in western Sahara, while Turkey-based, London-listed Genel, which has 75 per cent of another two blocks, is developing assets in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and will start exploration in Somaliland in December.Dualeh says about a third of 24 blocks – which cover the entire country – have so far been given out but that the prospects look good. Yemen, just across an expanse of water, has 9.8bn barrels and Kenya to the south has recently discovered likely commercial quantities of oil.The self-declared state of Somaliland, internationally recognised as a semi-autonomous region, is agreeing individual contracts as it has yet to release its own petroleum code. The only existing code dates back to the days of unity.“The geology is just very very exciting; the whole of east Africa has woken up and Somaliland is right at the spearhead of that,” says Mohammed Yusef, chairman and CEO of Petrosoma, whose 50/50 joint venture with Australia’s Jacka Resources will start the first aeromagnetic survey of their southern Odewayne blocks on Thursday. He says exploration is likely to run to $45-50m in the next two years. Yusef acquired the blocks in 2005 and spent years searching for co-investors to develop the acreage before agreeing a 50 per cent deal with Jacka Resources in March this year.“What’s changed is that the investor sentiment is more positive. It’s not an accident that it’s an Australian company,” says Yusef “They went into Uganda against conventional wisdom and found the biggest monster in Lake Albert and that kicked off the whole east Africa oil revolution,” says Yusef of Jacka’s management team, who spearheaded exploration into Uganda’s oil potential, which has so far yielded reserves running to 3.5bn barrels.“In Australia and Canada and to some extent in South Africa where they’re used to investing in natural resource investing in anything that makes sense and is viable, they can find money and they are quick to understand risk in places like Somaliland.”Unlike other blocks, there are no former claimants on the 22,000 sq km of the Odewayne area licensed to Petrosoma and Jacka, which covers parts of three blocks.“It’s like discovering an undervalued share. We’re not a fragile state any more after 21 years; we’re undeveloped but we’re a very, very resilient state. When the oil is discovered Berbera [the port] will be shipping oil rather than camels,” he adds.Related reading:

140;COP;Conocophillips;2012-10-25T21:35:24Z;ConocoPhillips profit drops after spin-off;;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company by production, is planning a push into the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico to sustain its longer-term growth, the company said today, in the latest sign of how the region’s industry is recovering after BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.Conoco is a junior partner in three wells that other companies are drilling in the gulf this year, but intends to start drilling three to six wells of its own each year.Jeff Sheets, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times: “Over the past four or five years we have been building up an acreage position in the Gulf of Mexico . . . and we’re getting to the point where we’re beginning to ramp activity up.”He was speaking as Conoco reported an underlying 7 per cent drop in earnings for the third quarter, stripping out the effect of the spin-off of Phillips 66, the refining, pipelines and chemicals business, which was demerged in May.Conoco was hit by a fall in prices for gas and natural gas liquids such as ethane, but offset that by shifting the balance of its production away from gas and towards more lucrative crude oil.Oil and gas production was down 1 per cent from the third quarter of 2011 at 1.525m barrels of oil equivalent per day, after some producing assets were sold.However, Ryan Lance, chief executive, said the company was still on track to hit his target of 3-5 per cent average annual production growth during 2012-16.Mr Sheets said that growth did not rely on finding any more reserves, but could be projected as a result of developments of previous discoveries.Conoco is growing rapidly in two US regions at the heart of the shale oil boom, where production was not previously commercially viable but has been made possible by advances in production techniques: the Bakken in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in Texas. It is also raising its production in the oil sands of western Canada.It also has projects under way in the UK and Norwegian North Sea, the Canadian oil sands, Malaysia and Australia, which it expects will offset natural decline in its fields and deliver a rise in overall production.Those projects mean Conoco will need to invest about $16bn per year over the next few years, up from $12.2bn last year.The Gulf of Mexico exploration is unlikely to have any effect on production before 2016, and is intended to provide new sources of growth after that period.Mr Lance said the results for the first full quarter since the demerger showed Conoco was on its way “to delivering our unique combination of growth, returns and yield”.He pointed out that the yield on Conoco’s shares was about 4.5 per cent, a little lower than large European companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, which yields 5 per cent, or Total, which yields 6 per cent, but ahead of most other groups that are like Conoco focused solely on exploration and production.Net income from continuing operations was down an underlying 7 per cent at $1.77bn for the third quarter but, helped by stock buybacks, earnings per share were up an underlying 3 per cent at $1.44. Revenues were down 10 per cent at $15.1bn.The earnings were better than analysts had expected and the shares closed up 2.2 per cent at $57.16.The reshaping of Conoco’s portfolio, which has included the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil of Russia and other disposals as well as the spin-off of Phillips 66, is still under way.Mr Lance said the company had raised $2.1bn from asset sales so far this year, and was on track to reach $8bn-$10bn of disposals by the end of 2013.Mr Sheets did not deny reports that Conoco has put up for sale a stake of up to 50 per cent in its Canadian oil sands business, with an estimated price tag of about $5bn, and suggested that the remaining asset sales were likely to come outside the US, but added that the disposals “will take time to do”.Production of oil and other liquids, which generally offers better returns, especially in North America, was up 1 per cent at 713,000 b/d, while production of “dry” gas was down 5 per cent at 4.2bn cubic feet per day.The average price Conoco received for its crude oil was $102.72, down only 4 per cent on a year ago, but the average price for gas was down 16 per cent at $4.56 per thousand cubic feet.North American natural gas prices have been hit by booming shale output, and earlier this year the Henry Hub benchmark hit a 10-year low below $2 per thousand cubic feet, although it has subsequently bounced back to about $3.40.Prices for natural gas liquids used as chemical feedstocks have been affected by the same supply boom, and Conoco’s selling price dropped 27 per cent over the year to $40.39 per barrel.
141;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors in push for greener oil sands;;A group of 49 investors with more than $2tn under management is launching an initiative on Monday to put pressure on companies operating in the Canadian oil sands to improve their environmental performance.The investors accept that the production from the oil sands of Alberta is going to rise, but want companies such as BP, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and Total that are active there to curb their greenhouse gas emissions and water use.They argue that environmental impacts could create a significant threat to future earnings, for example if production has to be curbed as a result of water shortages, or regulations on greenhouse gases make the oil sands uncompetitive.The initiative is backed by foundations and fund managers including Dexia Asset Management, Trillium and F&C.Andrew Logan of Ceres, the US-based investor network that organised the initiative, said: “These are institutions that have a lot invested in the success of the oil sands. They are not anti-oil sands per se, but there is a lot of concern about the financial risks if the status quo is maintained.”High oil prices and improvements in efficiency have meant that the commercial prospects for oil sands production look good. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers forecast in June that oil sands production would nearly double from 1.61m barrels per day last year to 3.16m b/d by 2020, and reach 5m b/d by 2030.Canada is already the largest source of US oil imports, and its importance is set to grow. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has promised that if elected he would on “day one” approve the Keystone XL pipeline that could carry diluted bitumen from Alberta into the US.However, there are still widespread concerns about the environmental effects of oil sands production, reflected in threats such as the opposition to Keystone XL and proposed fuel standards in the EU and California.The new investor group plans to engage with Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance, a new group of 12 leading companies operating in the region, set up in March, which aims to enable sustained growth in the oil sands by improving environmental performance.The investors hope to persuade Cosia to set specific targets for cuts in water use and pollution, including an objective for greenhouse gases that would make emissions from the oil sands no higher than for other sources of oil. Greenhouse gas emissions per barrel of oil produced were on a declining trend in 1990-2004, but stabilised in 2004-09, and have started rising since 2010 as a result of the increase in “in situ” production underground, which typically has higher emissions than mining the sands.The investors also want companies working in the oil sands to invest more in renewable energy.
142;COP;Conocophillips;2012-10-21T18:30:58Z;Rosneft deal marks new dawn for BP;;Last Friday, a black Mercedes with tinted windows slipped into BP’s underground car park, avoiding the TV crews and paparazzi camped out by the oil group’s front entrance in St James’ Square.In the back sat Igor Sechin, chief executive of Rosneft – and BP’s newly-minted strategic partner.After hours of painstaking negotiations stretching into Friday night, Mr Sechin and BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley shook hands, ushering in what promises to be one of the oil industry’s most unique partnerships.BP’s board had just approved an offer from Rosneft to buy the UK oil group out of its Russian joint venture, TNK-BP, in a cash-and-shares deal worth up to $27bn. The transaction, which must still be approved by the Russian government, will leave BP with a stake of at least 19 per cent in Rosneft, making it the second largest shareholder in the company after the Russian state.The deal marks a new dawn for BP in Russia, the world’s largest producer of oil and gas and home to some of its largest untapped hydrocarbon riches. It also brings an end to BP’s long, lucrative but strife-ridden association with TNK-BP, a venture whose commercial success was overshadowed by the fractious relationship between BP and its partners, AAR.“There’s recognition that both sides can bring a lot to this,” says one person familiar with the BP-Rosneft negotiations. “This can be a win/win … The other relationship always seemed to be win/lose.”The deal makes strategic sense for BP. Its current partners, led by the head of Alfa, Mikhail Fridman, typify the generation of Russian entrepreneurs who rose to prominence in the chaotic Yeltsin years on the back of the break-up and privatisation of the Soviet Union’s oil industry.Since Vladimir Putin’s ascent to the presidency nearly 13 years ago, that has gone into reverse, with Rosneft emerging as the state’s chosen vehicle for consolidating state control over the sector and Mr Sechin himself in the driving seat. Rosneft was the main beneficiary of the carve-up of Yukos, once Russia’s biggest private oil company, whose chief executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky was jailed for fraud after a trial seen as highly politicised.Yet there is concern among some investors that BP might be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. Some fear BP will have little say in how Rosneft is run, even with a 20 per cent stake and a seat on the board. Others see potential corporate governance risks in partnering with a company widely seen as a proxy for the Russian state.“They will have a seat at the table in Rosneft, but they will be very much the junior partner, without control,” says Stephen Thornber, global equity fund manager at Threadneedle Investments. “It’s a national oil company, and will be run for the benefit of the Russian government and the Russian people.” BP, he says, will have “little weight in decision-making”.Some have cited the case of ConocoPhillips, the US oil company. In 2004, it built up the strongest position of any US oil company in Russia with an 8 per cent shareholding in oil producer Lukoil that it later increased to 20 per cent. However, the investment did not win Conoco either access to Russia’s vast oil and gas reserves, or influence in Lukoil’s boardroom. It ended up selling the stake.BP executives reject the comparison. Conoco’s main problem was that it backed the wrong horse: Lukoil had been one of Russia’s fastest-growing oil companies, but its influence waned with the rise of state-owned groups such as Rosneft and Gazprom under Mr Putin. They also note that Conoco decided to sell the Lukoil stake as part of a broader asset disposal plan aimed at reducing debt.Company executives are playing down the prospect that this weekend’s deal will automatically open new prospects for BP in the Russian Arctic. There has been speculation the company could soon forge a new exploration alliance with Rosneft similar to the one that was blocked in the courts by AAR last year.But the licence areas that were awarded to BP under last year’s abortive deal have been reallocated to ExxonMobil, and two other companies – ENI and Statoil – have also clinched agreements with Rosneft on Arctic acreage, leaving little over for the UK oil group.That, says one person close to the company, is not necessarily as disappointing as it sounds. Exxon and the others, they note, will have to shoulder all the exploration costs of their joint ventures with Rosneft – costs that could run into the billions of dollars. Meanwhile BP, as a significant Rosneft shareholder, will be able to share in the upside of higher production and bigger profits.No one at BP thinks it is plain-sailing for the company from now on. “It’s not risk-free,” says a person close to the company. “This is Russia.”

145;COP;Conocophillips;2012-09-16T17:07:58Z;Politics clogs the flow from the Orinoco;Venezuela’s state oil company cannot extract oil from the world’s largest untapped reserves on its own;At first sight, there is little remarkable about the sparsely-populated, scrubby alluvial plains on the north bank of the lower Orinoco river.But underneath the 21,000 square mile strip of land known as the Orinoco Belt lies the bright future of Venezuela’s oil production: the largest untapped crude reserves in the world.There is one significant problem: the Opec country’s state oil company PDVSA cannot get that oil out of the ground alone.PDVSA is all too aware of this but sometimes it seems as if President Hugo Chávez is not – to judge, at least, by the offhand way in which he has treated foreign oil companies.His habit of “changing the rules of the game” has riled oil majors. After increasing royalties, which most analysts agree were too low given rising oil prices, the radical leader in 2007 unilaterally decided to convert existing contracts into joint ventures, boosting PDVSA’s share in each to 60 per cent and giving it operational control.ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips balked at this and left but Chevron chose to remain, along with Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total and Norway’s Statoil.The sheer size of reserves in the Orinoco has since attracted a horde of companies from ideologically friendly countries such as Russia, China and Vietnam, as well as others from India, Japan and Italy.But several years after the new contracts were signed, little extra oil is being produced. The biggest barrier to boosting production in the Orinoco is the money required to get the projects off the ground – at least $80bn.With 60 per cent of the investment due from PDVSA, whose financial resources are compromised by the need to divert funds to political projects, oilmen doubt that production will rise as fast as PDVSA’s projections suggest. “You have to apply a Venezuela discount,” said one foreign oil executive.Meanwhile, it will be hard for private companies to get financing, not least since Venezuela’s withdrawal from the World Bank’s International Court for the Settlement of Investment Disputes earlier this year. “Without international arbitration of some form, you won’t get a penny from the banks,” said a person from the private sector.Still, while oil companies recognise that the country is fraught with problems, they also accept that they are not unique to Venezuela.
146;COP;Conocophillips;2012-09-12T18:26:42Z;US groups step up sales of non-core units;;US companies are shedding non-core assets at a record rate, selling underperforming units to competitors and financial sponsors as investors pressure management to streamline amid financial hardship.Divestitures account for a record 57 per cent of US mergers and acquisitions by deal value so far this year, according to Dealogic. That is up from just 42 per cent last year, and 26 per cent in 2005.High profile disposals include ConocoPhillips spinning off its $20.7bn Phillips 66 business, and Pfizer selling its infant nutrition business to Nestlé for $11.85bn.“A key driver is the major companies moving their way back to basics,” said Daniel Kerstein, head of the strategic finance group at Barclays. “We’ve seen this across industries. Companies have highlighted the fact they’re going to shrink to grow.”The disposals come in all forms, as companies look to maximise the value of their expendable assets. While Pfizer opted for a sale to a strategic buyer, and ConocoPhillips launched a public offering, many other companies are selling to private equity groups.Carlyle Group has been a particularly active acquirer of such units. It bought Dupont’s performance coatings business for $5bn, and the Hamilton Sundstrand Industrial business from United Technologies for $3.5bn.“You have a lot of buyers,” said Robert Kindler, global head of M&A for Morgan Stanley. “The private equity firms can get financing. Leverage is coming back.”The proportion of divestitures could be higher than usual in part because of lower overall M&A volumes. “We’ve seen companies more willing to do spins, IPOs and carve-outs as there’s been a less robust M&A market in recent years,” said Mr Kerstein.However, other factors are prompting US companies to consider more disposals than ever before. In particular, activist investors are pressuring companies with stagnant share prices to sell underperforming units in an attempt to create value for shareholders.“We’ve been going through a period of time, driven by activism, where companies are being rewarded by corporate clarity,” said Mr Kindler.A simpler mix of businesses makes it easier for analysts and investors to value a company, giving shares a better chance of performing well. “As a general matter, if you are perceived to be a conglomerate, you will trade at a discount,” said Mr Kindler.More disposals are likely to come this year. Stanley Black & Decker is selling its hardware and home improvement unit and expects to fetch about $1.5bn, according to people familiar with the matter.“Companies are streamlining so they’re easier to understand from the outside, and easier to manage from the inside,” said Mr Kerstein.
147;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Shell woes deter others from US Arctic;;Royal Dutch Shell’s regulatory problems in the US Arctic, where it has faced repeated delays to an ambitious oil exploration campaign, are deterring other energy groups with licences in the US’s northern oceans, according to one of the most active companies in the region.Tim Dodson, head of exploration at Norway’s Statoil, said Shell’s experience, which was a “bellwether” for the industry, had reduced the appeal of working in the Chukchi Sea north-west of Alaska.“As long as Shell has not been able to show they can get the permits and start to drill, we’re a bit sceptical about moving forward,” he said in an interview. “You need that kind of comfort that they will be allowed to do it in a predictable manner.”Statoil revealed this week that it had delayed its planning for drilling in the Chukchi Sea by a year, and would now start in 2015 at the earliest.Shell believes the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas could contain 25bn barrels of oil, and has spent $4.5bn over the past seven years preparing to drill there. Other companies including Statoil and ConocoPhillips have also acquired licences.Environmentalists strongly oppose their plans to tap Arctic reserves, saying the risks of an oil spill in what is a pristine wilderness are too high. Legal challenges, a moratorium on Arctic oil exploration imposed after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and other regulatory issues means Shell has yet to drill a single well.After last week securing a concession from the US government that it could begin drilling before its final permits were awarded, Shell now hopes to start its Chukchi Sea well this week.On Tuesday, the Noble Discoverer rig was almost in position, having been delayed by bad weather, and was on track to start drilling before the end of the week.However, the preliminary permit from the US authorities allows Shell to drill no lower than 1,400 feet, about 4,000 feet above the reservoir thought to hold oil.It will not be allowed to penetrate oil-bearing rocks until it has deployed the Arctic Challenger, a 300-foot barge converted to carry a containment system for catching oil in the event of a spill, which is still awaiting approval by the US Coast Guard.Shell hopes the Arctic Challenger can have its final tests of seaworthiness soon – probably this week – but it is running out of time before the deadline set by US regulators for the end of drilling in the Chukchi Sea: September 24.The company has applied for an extension, but may not be able to complete a well before the ice closes in again, and would not be able to restart drilling until next July.Statoil’s Mr Dodson said he was “concerned” about the cost issues Shell has faced – particularly those arising from the regulatory requirement that it have two rigs available, one to drill a relief well in the event of a blowout similar to the one that triggered the Deepwater Horizon disaster. “Some of these regulations can make the costs of exploration prohibitive,” he said.Other parts of the Arctic – such as the Canadian Beaufort Sea – are lower cost, he said. He said that in the coming months Statoil had plans to drill three wells offshore eastern Canada and nine in the Norwegian Barents Sea, where it has already made discoveries. But it will not be drilling in the Chukchi Sea before 2014.Mr Dodson said major oil companies could address the cost issue by teaming up on drilling exploration wells – a practice that is rare in the industry. “You will see more shared equity on these wells, to spread the risk and limit the cost exposure,” he said. He added that Statoil was already discussing this option with other companies that have leases in the northern seas, such as Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.Such an approach, he said, might mean the US would have to change its licensing procedures for Alaska, where exploration leases are awarded to the highest bidder in big-ticket licensing rounds. That “winner-takes-all, non-sharing approach … won’t work,” he said, in the light of Shell’s experience. “No one will want to move forward on a 100 per cent basis.”
148;COP;Conocophillips;2012-08-22T18:55:44Z;Conoco retreats further from Russia;;US oil and gas group ConocoPhillips has continued its retreat from Russia by selling its 30 per cent stake in the NaryanMarNefteGaz joint venture to its partner Lukoil, the Russian oil group.The deal will generate a $400m after-tax profit for Conoco, included in its third-quarter earnings. Conoco did not give an overall price for the disposal.Under its new chief executive Ryan Lance, who took over following the demerger of its downstream refining, marketing and chemicals businesses in May, Conoco is focusing mainly on developed countries and on North America in particular. The sale leaves Conoco, the third-largest US oil company by production, with only one small asset in Russia, a joint venture with Rosneft, the state-controlled oil group.The move contrasts with a recent expansion into Russia by its bigger US rival ExxonMobil, which this year agreed an ambitious joint venture with Rosneft to explore in the Russian Arctic.In 2004, Conoco built up the strongest position of any US oil company in Russia, taking an 8 per cent stake in Lukoil that it later increased to 20 per cent.However, the investment failed to deliver the benefits the company had hoped for, in terms of access to Russia’s vast oil and gas reserves, and in 2010 it began selling its stake as part of a wider strategic rethink. The last of Conoco’s holding in Lukoil was sold last year.Reporting results for the second quarter, Mr Lance said Conoco planned to make disposals worth $8bn-$10bn by the middle of next year, including $1.6bn from sales in the first half of the year. He said: “We’re committed to getting the programme completed, but we’ll do that at acceptable prices.”The company had already raised $20bn from disposals in 2010-11, including about $9.5bn from the 20 per cent stake in Lukoil.NMNG’s principal asset is an oilfield in the far north of Russia called South Khylchuyu that initially attracted great excitement and was thought to hold about 500m barrels of reserves. Both Conoco and Lukoil expressed optimism about its prospects, but later said the geologists had been over-optimistic about its resource base.Lukoil announced last year that it was writing off some 30m tonnes of South Khylchuyu’s reserves, bringing the total down to 40m tonnes. Production at the field started in 2008, peaked in 2010 at 150,000 barrels per day, and has been declining sharply ever since.Conoco’s one remaining Russian asset is its 50 per cent stake in the Polar Lights joint venture with Rosneft, which produces just 6,000 b/d. Analysts have suggested that the Polar Lights stake could also be sold. Conoco’s shares fell 0.6 per cent to $56.29 in afternoon trading in New York.
149;COP;Conocophillips;2012-07-26T13:13:08Z;Centrica profits rise 18% on higher tariffs;;Centrica defended a 23 per cent jump in first half operating profits at its British Gas residential energy business on Thursday, following criticism from UK consumer groups.Sam Laidlaw, chief executive, said that earnings were in line with British Gas residential’s pre-tax profit margin target of 6 to 7 per cent and were “nothing really unusual” when compared to the results of the past five years.But compared with a weak first half in 2011, when unseasonably warm weather pushed down household gas use in the UK, revenues for British Gas rose 17 per cent to £4.8bn while operating profit rose 23 per cent to £345m.Although colder spring weather this year caused households to leave their heating on for longer, pushing up gas consumption, higher tariffs also helped boost profits.British Gas raised its average gas prices by 18 per cent and electricity prices by 16 per cent last August, blaming higher wholesale gas costs, but only cut electricity bills by 5 per cent in January, with no change to gas tariffs.Mr Laidlaw said it was still too early to tell whether British Gas would put up bills later this year, “but wholesale gas prices for this winter are still higher than they were for last winter”. He added that the cost of social and environmental policies, such as subsidies for renewable energy, continued to go up, and these would be passed on to consumers.At Centrica’s upstream business, higher gas production and higher average prices were partially offset by lower power production but the division still notched up a 28 per cent rise in operating profits to £682m.The business started to feel the benefit of the purchase of several North Sea gasfields from Statoil, ConocoPhillips and Total during the first half, and Centrica said it expected overall oil and gas production to rise 20 per cent this year.The group warned that a drop in wholesale power prices in the UK while gas costs stayed relatively high had hit profits at its gas-fired power stations, and had caused it to close the 325MW Kings Lynn power plant and put the Peterborough and Roosecote plants on review for closure.At the group level, Centrica’s revenues rose 4 per cent to £11.98bn and underlying profits rose 18 per cent to £1.26bn. Diluted earnings from continuing operations were 19p, and the group proposed an interim dividend of 4.62p, up from 4.29p last time.FT CommentWhile consumer groups berated Centrica yesterday for making higher profits at the expense of hard-pressed British Gas customers, analysts said the results were in line with expectations and investors took it in their stride, with shares rising 1.9 per cent to 317p. But over the next few months several big questions need to be answered for Centrica to press ahead with its investment plans in the UK, on the levels of government support for new wind farms and nuclear reactors, and on incentives to build new gas plants to back up intermittent wind power. The outcomes are still uncertain, making Centrica’s shares hard to value, but on a forward p/e of about 11 times the stock trades in line with peer Scottish and Southern Energy.
150;COP;Conocophillips;2012-07-25T17:50:40Z;ConocoPhillips hit by split and price fall;;ConocoPhillips said on Wednesday that its earnings had fallen by a third in the second quarter, the result of lower oil and gas prices and the spin-off of its downstream refining and chemicals business.Having separated itself in May from its less profitable downstream assets, now a standalone company called Phillips 66, ConocoPhillips is trying to reinvent itself as a high-growth exploration and production group.The restructuring was intended to sharpen the group’s focus and increase its appeal to investors with the promise of 3 to 5 per cent average annual production growth during 2012-16, significantly higher than Conoco’s integrated rivals. But unlike most pure E&P companies, Conoco has pledged to keep paying a relatively high dividend.Many large oil companies have been urged by bankers and analysts to undergo a similar split. BP in particular has faced repeated calls for a break-up, particularly in the aftermath of 2010’s Deepwater Horizon disaster.Conoco’s main assets are in North America, where it has exposure to Canada’s fast-expanding tar sands industry and growth prospects in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Internationally, it has projects in the North Sea, Malaysia and in liquefied natural gas in Australia. After it failed to make progress in Russia through a joint venture with Lukoil, the group is now focusing on developed countries.Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said weaker commodities prices – especially for North American gas – had been the main factor hitting earnings, “but we had a strong quarter, strategically and operationally”.The average price realised per barrel of oil equivalent fell to $66, from $72 in the second quarter of 2011, while North American natural gas fell to $1.93 per thousand cubic feet, from $4.04 in the second quarter of 2011, reflecting the glut of shale gas production in the region.Conoco’s production for the quarter was 1.54m barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from 1.64m boepd in the second quarter of 2011, because of disposals and maintenance work, as well as cuts in North American gas output.Mr Lance said the group was diverting investment away from drilling for gas in the US towards more profitable oil-rich prospects.Revenue, excluding refining and other discontinued items, fell 14 per cent in the second quarter to $15.2bn, from $17.7bn a year earlier.Net income was $2.27bn, or $1.80 a share, down from $3.4bn, or $2.41 a share, a year earlier. Excluding writedowns, asset gains and other items, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.22, down from $1.64.Conoco plans to make $8bn to $10bn of asset sales by the middle of next year, and said it had sold off $1.6bn of assets in the first half. Mr Lance said some of the disposals were taking longer than expected. “We’re committed to getting the programme completed, but we’ll do that at acceptable prices.”Conoco’s shares fell 3.1 per cent to $52.93.
151;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Allegations of Chesapeake collusion probed;;Encana, the Calgary-based gas company, has launched an internal investigation into allegations of collusion with Chesapeake Energy, a US rival, to avoid competing when bidding for oil and gas development leases in Michigan in 2010.Emails between Chesapeake and Encana executives, reported by Reuters, the news agency, suggested that they had discussed forming a joint venture to bid for leases jointly and later co-ordinated which leases to bid for.Such co-operation could be illegal under antitrust laws.Chesapeake acknowledged in a statement that it had held discussions with Encana in 2010 about forming an “area of mutual interest” joint venture in Michigan under which the two companies would have worked together to develop oil and gasfields in the state.However, it added: “No such agreement was reached between the parties and no AMI was formed. Nor did Encana and Chesapeake make any joint bids.”Encana said in its statement that it “takes compliance with all laws very seriously and is committed to ethical business conduct in all that we do”.David O’Brien, Encana’s chairman, added: “In accordance with Encana’s policies, an investigation of this matter was immediately initiated.”Chesapeake spent about $400m acquiring assets in Michigan, but has now put 450,000 acres of leases up for sale as it attempts to raise about $10bn in cash this year to bridge the cap between its cash flows and its capital spending plans.The collusion allegations are the latest blow to hit the company after a series of revelations about the personal finances of Aubrey McClendon, its chief executive, and growing concerns about its debts and off-balance sheet liabilities.Last week the c ompany appointed Archie Dunham, the former chairman of ConocoPhillips, as independent chairman, and replaced four board members with new directors nominated by its largest shareholders.The reports of collusion contributed to an 8.5 per cent decline in Chesapeake’s share price to $17.03 on Monday and a 3.7 per cent decline in Encana’s to C$19.61.
152;COP;Conocophillips;2012-06-23T06:35:03Z;Chesapeake’s new chairman faces hard challenge;;At the age of 73, Archie Dunham is taking on one of the toughest jobs anywhere in the energy business: keeping watch over Aubrey McClendon.Mr Dunham, announced on Thursday as the new chairman at Chesapeake Energy, has an eminent reputation in the industry, but nothing in his long career has presented him with an equivalent challenge.Under Mr McClendon, its dynamic co-founder, chief executive and now ex-chairman, Chesapeake has built up the industry’s best portfolio of onshore US oil and gasfields, but also large debts and off-balance sheet liabilities.Mr Dunham’s job will be to make the best use of Mr McClendon’s talents, as the company shifts its focus from acquiring new drilling rights in promising areas to producing oil and gas on leases that it owns already.He must also pick through the complexities of Chesapeake’s financial structure to decide on the best option for maximising shareholder value, which could mean accepting a takeover bid.None of that will be easy. Although Mr McClendon is relinquishing the chairmanship, he will remain a powerful presence at the company.No one knows the business he started 23 years ago better than he does, and he still has a personal 2.5 per cent stake in many of the company’s wells.Under a recent change in the company’s rules, he will retain the right to call board meetings and special meetings of shareholders.Mr Dunham does not look like the man to break that grip. That is not because he is a shrinking violet. People who know him say he is a strong enough personality to stand up to Mr McClendon. Having grown up and taken his first degree and MBA in Oklahoma, the home state of Chesapeake and Mr McClendon, he moved away and became a prominent figure in the business establishment in Houston.He is politically well connected, having served on two advisory commissions for president George W. Bush, and was president of both the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute, two of the country’s most influential industry lobby groups.In its statement after his appointment, he said he was “attracted by the clear mandate to provide strong oversight” over the company.However, he has no record of coming in to sort out troubled companies such as Chesapeake. He was a long-serving executive with Conoco and its then parent Du Pont, the chemicals group. He joined Conoco in 1966, eventually rising to become chief executive in 1996, and led its spin-off from Du Pont in 1998. He has never held a senior executive role at another company, although he has had several non-executive directorships, including at the Union Pacific railway company, where he is still on the board.There is one respect, though, in which his prior experience could prove highly relevant. The defining moment of Mr Dunham’s career came in 2001, when he agreed a $35bn merger for Conoco with Phillips, another US oil group.His role in that deal was criticised, both at the time and subsequently, on the grounds that he should have squeezed out more value for Conoco’s investors. Phillips shareholders took 57 per cent of the merged company, where Mr Dunham became chairman while Jim Mulva of Phillips became chief executive.Some analysts say the possibility that there was “money left on the table” in that deal suggests Mr Dunham lacks the hard bargaining skills needed to secure the best possible outcome for Chesapeake’s investors.However, Amy Myers Jaffe of Rice university in Houston points out that Conoco shareholders who hung on to their equity in the merged company did well out of it. ConocoPhillips’ stock went on an excellent run, comfortably outperforming its larger rival ExxonMobil, up until the collapse of oil and gas prices in the second half of 2008. While the merger may not have delivered much of an immediate pay-off to shareholders, it created a stronger company that prospered for most of the decade.Having retired as chairman of ConocoPhillips back in 2004, Mr Dunham faded from view, but he is now squarely back in the spotlight. If he can secure for Chesapeake’s battered investors as good an outcome as he delivered for Conoco’s, his return to the ring to fight again will have been well worth it.
153;COP;Conocophillips;2012-06-21T20:45:18Z;Chesapeake names Dunham chairman;;Chesapeake Energy, the US gas producer, has appointed Archie Dunham, former head of ConocoPhillips, as its new chairman in a boardroom shake-up intended to address investors’ concerns over corporate governance and give large shareholders more influence.Mr Dunham, who has been appointed along with four other new independent directors, replaces Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake’s co-founder who has drawn criticism in recent months over his personal finances. Mr McClendon will remain chief executive.Chesapeake, which is the second-largest US natural gas producer after ExxonMobil, also named three new directors nominated by Southeastern Asset Management, its largest shareholder with 13.9 per cent, and one nominated by Carl Icahn, the activist investor who took a 7.6 per cent stake in the company last month.Five directors are leaving the board, which has also been criticised for its oversight of the company’s strategy and Mr McClendon’s activities.Chesapeake’s shares plunged in April after revelations that Mr McClendon had borrowed extensively against his personal stakes in the company’s wells, building up a debt of $846m at the end of last year. The company promised to appoint an independent chairman as one of its first responses to the news about Mr McClendon’s debts.Concerns have also grown over the company’s mounting debts and off-balance sheet liabilities, as its cash flow is hurt by low natural gas prices.Facing a funding gap between cash flow and planned capital spending of about $10bn this year, Chesapeake is targeting $11bn in asset disposals, including the $4bn sale of pipeline assets announced this month.Mr Dunham worked at Conoco for more than 30 years, starting as an engineer and rising to president, chief executive and chairman. In 2002 he oversaw the merger of Conoco and Phillips Petroleum, creating the third-largest US oil company at the time.Southeastern’s chosen directors are Bob Alexander, founder of Alexander Energy, Brad Martin, former chief executive of Saks, and Frederic Poses, chief executive of Ascend Performance Materials. Mr Icahn named Vincent Intrieri, senior managing director of Icahn Capital and a director at Dynegy and CVR Energy, in which Mr Icahn also owns stakes.They replace Richard Davidson, Kathleen Eisbrenner, Frank Keating and Don Nickles, who resigned, and Charles Maxwell, who retired at the company’s annual meeting this month.Burns Hargis, the president of Oklahoma State University who heads the board’s audit committee, resigned when shareholders rejected his re-election at this month’s annual meeting earlier this month. However, he will be staying on while he leads the board’s review of Mr McClendon’s finances.Mr Icahn said on Thursday: “We believe Chesapeake is now heading in the right direction. With the board providing strong oversight, the management team will be sharply focused on realising the value of its assets and the company will be well positioned to create substantial value for shareholders.”Mr McClendon remains a member of the board along with Louis Simpson, named by Southeastern last year, and Merrill “Pete” Miller Jr. Chesapeake has said shareholders will be able to elect the entire board at its 2013 annual meeting.The company’s shares closed down 4.8 per cent at $18.12 on Thursday in New York. The stock has fallen nearly 19 per cent this year.
154;COP;Conocophillips;2012-06-21T16:33:30Z;Russian relief at shale boom hitches;Fracking setback in Poland follows other countries’ moratoriums;"At a dinner late last year, Vladimir Putin was asked how big a threat the development of shale gas in Europe posed to the energy exports of Russia’s Gazprom to the continent. Russia’s then prime minister grew agitated.Grabbing a notebook, he sketched a diagram to illustrate hydraulic “fracking”, the controversial technology used to unlock shale gas reserves. Jabbing at it with his pen, Mr Putin warned that once Europeans understood its environmental risks – potential damage to groundwater – fracking would face a clampdown.Executives of Gazprom were using similar words. Beneath the defensive bluster seemed to lurk genuine concern that “unconventional” gas could become the same game-changer for Europe’s gas industry as it has been in the US – sharply reducing its need for imports.Six months later, however, the challenge from shale gas to Gazprom’s European energy dominance looks to be waning.In a further blow to Poland’s hopes of breaking free from dependence on Russian imports, ExxonMobil this week pulled out of Polish shale gas exploration after disappointing flow rates from test wells.Exxon’s move came less than three months after Poland’s government geological institute slashed by 90 per cent its estimated shale gas reserves.The new estimate, of 346bn-768bn cubic metres, could be enough to reduce sharply Russian imports that provide 70 per cent of Polish domestic consumption.But it is unlikely to turn Poland into a big gas exporter, as it had hoped last year. Then, a US agency estimated Poland might have 5.3tn cubic metres – enough, as Poland’s Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper put it, to make Poles the “sheikhs of Europe”.Exxon had only six of the 109 shale gas concessions Poland has handed out, and companies including Chevron and ConocoPhillips are still looking. Warsaw is also pushing domestic groups PKN Orlen and PGNiG to develop shale gas.But Exxon’s withdrawal was piquant, coming only days after the US major agreed with Russia’s Rosneft to develop “tight oil” reserves in western Siberia – requiring the same fracking technology Mr Putin railed against last year.Europe’s gas industry is watching developments in Poland particularly closely, moreover, since it is one of the few countries with significant shale gas potential that has not restricted fracking.Rather as Mr Putin predicted, the technology – pumping water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure into shale to open fractures that release gas – is facing a wave of at least temporary moratoriums.IHS Energy, a consultancy, says that a moratorium imposed by France last year has had a domino effect. Germany’s North Rhine-Westphalia (home to the country’s most promising reserves), Bulgaria and Romania have all followed; the Czech upper house is discussing a ban this week.“There was talk in Europe that shale gas was going to be the magic bullet that would reduce Gazprom’s role in supplying Europe, given that the [main] shale gas formations are in places that were heavily reliant on Russian gas,” says Andrew Neff, a Moscow-based analyst for IHS Energy.One place where shale gas exploration is taking off is Ukraine – a top Gazprom market, and where price disputes have twice led to shut-offs of Russian imports since 2006. Kiev last month awarded the first tenders to explore sizeable shale deposits to Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell. But actual production is a long way off. Ukraine keeps prices for domestically produced gas sold to households below market levels, subsidising the difference from the state budget. This has limited investment that could boost production.To avoid a looming fiscal squeeze, Ukraine may to have raise household gas prices as a condition of getting a $15.6bn IMF assistance programme back on track. That, however, would be deeply unpopular. Another option would be to win lower prices for Russian gas by bowing to Moscow’s demands to sell to Gazprom the strategic gas export pipelines that run across Ukraine. Then, Ukraine would cement its Russian dependence – and shale gas would probably remain unprofitable.Europe’s shale gas industry still has important potential. Though it may be harder to release commercial quantities of gas from European rock than in the US, as Exxon found in Poland, the technology is likely to improve. If the EU develops standardised regulation for fracking, meanwhile, it may clear the way for fracking on a controlled basis.But Europe’s shale boom seems set to take longer to arrive, and to be less of an industry bonanza, than previously expected. And for now, Gazprom, and Mr Putin, have less to be agitated about.Neil Buckley is the Financial Times’s Eastern Europe Editor"
155;COP;Conocophillips;2012-06-18T16:00:15Z;Poland shale: Exxon exit;;"Is ExxonMobil scared or smart?That’s the question Polish shale gas enthusiasts are asking themselves after the US energy giant announced that it was halting work on looking for shale gas on its Polish concessions.“There have been no demonstrated sustained commercial hydrocarbon flow rates” in two test wells in eastern Poland, said an ExxonMobil spokesman, in a statement issued over the weekend which said the US energy major had “completed its exploration operations in Poland”.The doubters point to the rapidly shrinking estimates for Poland’s shale gas deposits as geologists get a firmer grasp of exactly what may lie several kilometres below Poland’s flat green fields.Just a year ago, the Polish government was brimming with enthusiasm over the prospect of the country becoming a new Norway after the US Energy Information Administration said Poland might have 5.3tn cubic metres of shale gas – the largest reserves in Europe.Then, earlier this year, the Polish government’s geological institute used newer data to come up with an estimate of reserves of 346-768bn cubic metres, only about 10 per cent of the earlier guess.In its two test wells, ExxonMobil found little of interest. Drilling by other firms has also been inconclusive – finding gas but with flow rates that left investors disappointed.However, it’s still early days in looking for gas in Poland. Although the government has granted 109 concessions covering much of the country, only just over two-dozen test wells have been drilled so far.While ExxonMobil is scampering for the exits (a similar course to what it did in Hungary in 2009 after disappointing test results there) the other big oil companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips are hanging tough.John Buggenhagen, exportation director for San Leon Energy, which has concessions scattered around Poland, told beyondbrics that it will take a lot more testing to see if Poland really does have the gas reserves to wean itself off Russian imports.“Exploration is about drilling wells and testing them – something that the majors have largely quit doing long ago,” he said – suggesting that if smaller companies like San Leon do hit interesting deposits ExxonMobil may well be back to help exploit them.Related reading:

156;COP;Conocophillips;2012-06-14T00:10:24Z;Rise in US oil supplies haunts Opec talks;;For four decades, Opec meetings have been a subject of intense interest in the US because of the impact of the oil cartel’s decisions on the price of fuel. Today, there is equally close scrutiny going back the other way.At a seminar in the Opec headquarters in Vienna on Wednesday, the rise in US oil supplies was the shadow that fell over every discussion. Over the past three years, the US has accounted for the entire net increase in global oil output, excluding Opec members and former Soviet republics.Advances in the techniques of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, first applied to shale gas reserves, are now making it possible to develop US oil in reserves previously commercially unviable.The US increased output of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons by 1.1m barrels a day during 2008-11. In that time, other countries that are not Opec members or former Soviet republics lost a net 200,000 barrels per day, according to the BP statistical review, a standard industry reference, published on Wednesday.The rise of US shale oil, along with other sources such as Canada’s tar sands, is raising the prospect that Opec’s share of the global market for crude, and hence its influence over the price, could be undermined.Opec’s defenders point out that the last rites have been read over the cartel many times and it is still in robust health.Its continued strength has been on display over the past year, as members Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait raised output to offset the loss of supplies caused by the civil war in Libya and sanctions against Iran. Had they not done so, the price of oil would have soared.The challenge from North American supplies is still in its infancy. US production is a long way below its 1971 peak, and it remains the world’s largest oil importer.The effect of increased flows of North American oil is likely to be offset by continuing decline for other western producers such as the UK and Norway.Nevertheless, the prospect of increased American supplies coming on to the market as China’s slowdown deepens is a troubling possibility for Opec.In Vienna, Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil group by production, set out a vision of a global shale oil revolution to chill Opec members’ blood. The US was enjoying its first meaningful growth in oil production for 20 years, he said, and Conoco expected US shale liquids production to grow 150 per cent by 2020.“Thanks to both shale and the Canadian oil sands, North America could become self-sufficient in oil … by 2025, and even a net exporter,” he said.In a gesture to Ali Naimi, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister who was chairing the session, Mr Lance added that no one expected a level of US exports anywhere near the kingdom’s 8m barrels a day.There was also potential to produce shale worldwide. Conoco and other companies are pursuing shale opportunities in countries such as Canada, Australia and Poland. “For too long, we’ve faced inaccurate perceptions in consuming nations of resource scarcity. [Now] both governments and consumers are becoming more aware of the greater abundance of oil and natural gas.”Outwardly, Opec ministers and officials are sceptical that the cartel’s market share will be eroded.Rafael Ramírez, Venezuela’s oil minister, said oil-consuming countries were labouring under a delusion that shale oil would “come to their rescue”, allowing them to throw off their dependency on Opec.Production from oil shales declines faster than from conventional fields and has a much greater environmental impact, he said, and “thousands of wells” would have to be drilled to equal Opec exports.Abdalla El-Badri, Opec’s secretary-general, acknowledged that shale oil and gas were changing the North American energy landscape. But there were still questions surrounding hydraulic fracturing, particularly its impact on groundwater, and it would “take time” to solve problems associated with the technique.He added that Opec would welcome any country becoming self-sufficient in energy.Privately, though, Opec member states are worried. Paul Stevens, senior research fellow at Chatham House, said expectations had always been that the rise in oil demand over the next 15-20 years would be met by Opec. But shale oil was changing the equation.“With the technology moving beyond the US, you could foresee a situation where the increase in supply might not be coming from Opec,” he said. “That is bound to concern them.”Since the 1970s, rivals to Opec production have emerged and faded. They have slackened the cartel’s grip, but never broken it.Amrita Sen of Barclays Capital expects that on a five or 10-year view, Opec will remain the only force in the oil market with the swing capacity and discipline to change production and hence affect prices.If non-Opec oil supplies look like becoming a serious threat, Saudi Arabia could lead a production increase to drive the price down, making high-cost rival sources uneconomic.But Mr Stevens points out that the high oil price sought by Opec is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they need it to balance their budgets. On the other, it encourages investments in unconventional oil reserves. “So they’re cutting their own throats,” he said.
157;COP;Conocophillips;2012-06-11T17:40:57Z;Phillips 66 looks at chemicals expansion;;"Phillips 66, the US refining and chemicals group, is considering investing in a second large new chemical plant in the Gulf of Mexico region to benefit from the cheap feedstock unlocked by the North American shale revolution.Greg Garland, chief executive, told the Financial Times that a final decision on building another plant, following the $5bn project it announced last year, could be taken in about three years’ time, but he was already starting to think about it.An investment boom is under way across the US petrochemicals sector, part of the American industrial revival fuelled by rising shale production.“After the Middle East, the US is the next best place to make petrochemicals, because of the advantaged feedstock, and we see that continuing for some time,” Mr Garland said.“It’s a great opportunity for our company and it’s a great opportunity for our country.”Phillips, which was spun off from ConocoPhillips in May, expects little growth from its refineries in the US and Europe, which are facing fuels markets set to be “flat to declining” in the long term.Their returns can be improved only by raising margins, which is why Phillips 66 is buying 2,000 rail tank cars to take advantage of the cheaper crude available from the North Dakota oil boom.The US petrochemicals industry, however, stands at the dawn of what Mr Garland expects to be a long-term upturn, and Phillips 66 stands to benefit through Chevron Phillips Chemical, its 50/50 joint venture with Chevron, the second-largest US oil group by market capitalisation.The shale boom, unlocking large new reserves of oil and gas through improvements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, has led to a surge in production of natural gas liquids (NGLs), such as ethane and propane.That has sent their prices tumbling, creating a large cost advantage for US chemicals manufacturers that use NGLs as a feedstock relative to competitors in Europe and Asia that used naphtha and other products derived from crude oil.Mr Garland said US chemicals manufacturers could buy ethane at about $5 per million British thermal units of energy content, compared to about $18 per mBTU for crude oil.That cheap feedstock persuaded CP Chem to announce last year that it would build a new “cracker” in Baytown, Texas, to convert ethane into ethylene, a basic building block for plastics and products such as detergents, cosmetics and textiles.It is also building nearby plants to turn some of the ethylene into polyethylene, a plastic often used for packaging.The Baytown cracker, expected to come into operation in 2017, will employ 10,000 people while under construction, and about 400 when it is running.Mr Garland said: “It’s a huge investment: it’s jobs, jobs, jobs.”Royal Dutch Shell, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil and Formosa Plastics have also been making progress with plans for new crackers: Shell in Pennsylvania and Dow, Exxon and Formosa in Texas. Other companies including Ineos and LyondellBasell are also planning to increase their US chemicals capacity.CP Chem is not only growing in the US; it is also looking at making an investment in Iraq.“We like the Middle East: it’s a good place to do business. It’s a volatile region; everyone understands that, but the values are good,” Mr Garland said.However, he added that the US was the focus for the global chemicals industry’s investment, contributing to a wider revival in manufacturing.“We’ve got customers now in the chemicals space talking about bringing business back from China to the US, to capture $2 natural gas, 8 per cent unemployment, cheap ethane and a shortened supply chain,” he said.For example, he said, manufacturers of low-cost plastic products sold in big value retail chains such as Walmart and Target were now thinking about returning to the US.The cost advantage for US producers is causing concern in the European chemicals industry.Kurt Bock, chief executive of BASF of Germany, the world’s biggest chemical maker by sales, told the FT in April that shale gas was a potential “game changer for parts of the industry in the US”.Larry Schwartz, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the research group, said: “Our work suggests we are going to see a large quantity of NGLs being produced in North America, and providing an economic advantage relative to the rest of the world.”"

159;COP;Conocophillips;2012-06-07T19:02:43Z;Phillips 66 to boost rail capacity for oil;;Phillips 66, the refining and chemicals group spun off from ConocoPhillips in May, is ordering 2,000 rail cars to transport crude from the North Dakota oilfields to its refineries on the east and west coasts of the US, in a sign of how the boom in onshore oil production is shaking up the American energy industry.Greg Garland, Phillips’ chief executive, told the Financial Times that the company was planning to buy the cars for a total price of about $200m, to enable it to carry up to 120,000 barrels per day of cheaper crude available in the central US.Phillips believes it will be more cost-effective for its refineries in California to transport oil more than 1,500 miles by rail than to buy it on international markets.Other US refiners such as Tesoro have also been buying more rail tank cars in recent years, but Phillips’ order is one of the largest.“If you go in with an order for 500, they put you in line. If you go in with an order for 2,000, you get people’s attention,” Mr Garland said.North Dakota has this year overtaken Alaska and California to became the second-largest state in the US for oil production, after Texas, with output of 575,490b/d in March, according to state data. Advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have opened up large reserves that could not previously be extracted at economic rates.The rise in onshore production has exceeded the pipeline capacity available to carry oil to the coast, opening a persistent price gap between US onshore oil such as benchmark West Texas Intermediate and international crudes such as Brent.On Thursday WTI was about $85 per barrel, while Brent was about $100.As a result, the financial performance of refineries in the central US with access to oil from North Dakota and Canada had been “just outstanding”, Mr Garland said, but refineries on the east and west coasts that use international crudes had been “struggling”.Shortly before the split, ConocoPhillips sold an east coast refinery, Trainer in Pennsylvania, to Delta Air Lines.The outlook for the US petrol market, where demand is expected to be flat to declining in the long term, means that Phillips’ priority is to run its refineries well.Mr Garland said: “Crude is 85 per cent of the cost of gasoline, so you’ve got to work on that. That’s the biggest lever we have.”Moving oil by rail is generally more expensive than using a pipeline, but Phillips thinks that for the foreseeable future there will be no pipes built to connect North Dakota to its refineries in California, Washington state and New Jersey, and the crude price gap is likely to persist.Buying rail cars also gives it the flexibility to draw on new sources of crude such as Colorado, seen as likely to be one of the next states to experience an oil boom.
160;COP;Conocophillips;2012-05-14T09:41:02Z;Attack of the zombie refineries;Oil refining spreads tightening as plants are relaunched;The process of creative destruction sweeping the oil refinery industry has gone from top gear into reverse.Over the past year, refiners in the Atlantic basin from ConocoPhillips in the US to Petroplus in Europe shut down plants, removing 1.6m barrels of capacity at the peak in January. The closures triggered a recovery in the refining margin between crude oil and oil products, known as crack spreads, a favourite market for hedge funds.But the refining business cycle is now turning full circle, with many of the mothballed plants restarting under new owners, again putting pressure on crack spreads.“The refining outlook has rapidly shifted from the mass closures seen at the start of the year to a mass of restarts over the coming months,” says Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JPMorgan in New York.Evan Calio, oil refining analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, puts it more graphically: “Like villains in horror movies, refineries are hard to kill.”The restart of some refineries comes with the arrival of a new class of owners – from trading houses to airlines and private equity groups – seeking bargains.Oil traders Vitol and Gunvor bought plants owned by the bankrupt Petroplus in Cressier (Switzerland) and Antwerp (Belgium) with refining capacity of 68,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively. Furthermore, two other Petroplus plants – the 162,000 b/d Petit Couronne in France and the 220,000 b/d Coryton in the UK – are still working through temporal agreements in spite of the parent’s insolvency.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines has purchased the 185,000 b/d Trainer refinery outside Philadelphia from Phillips 66, the refining business spun off from ConocoPhillips, as it seeks to hedge its raising jet fuel costs.Others are looking for further purchases. Carlyle, the private equity group, is in exclusive talks with Sunoco to buy a 330,000 b/d refinery in the Philadelphia area. And PetroChina has offered $350m for the 235,000 b/d Aruba refinery in the Caribbean owned by Valero.In total, about 1.3m b/d of refining capacity that was expected to be closed is now expected to return to the market.Earlier this year, closures boosted the traditional simple measure of margins, known as the 3:2:1 crack spread, significantly. In the US, it jumped to $26 a barrel, compared with a low point of $11 a barrel in early January and a five-year average of $14.7 a barrel. The restart of some refineries in the next few months could send crack spreads down againThe rapid turnround is raising eyebrows in the industry.The International Energy Agency, the western countries’ watchdog, summarised the view of many in the industry saying: “While the refinery purchases surely make sense for the new owners …, and the restarts are good for employment, they do nothing to address the fundamental overhang in capacity afflicting the OECD”.Of course, some closed refiners are unlikely to restart, supporting crack spreads. For example, the massive 350,000 refinery in St Croix, Virgin Islands – owned by Hovensa, a joint venture between Hess Corp. of the US and Petróleos de Venezuela – will probably be mothballed.Still, industry executives believe that more refineries will need to close this year to rebalance supply and demand, particularly as oil companies in Asia and the Middle East continue to invest in new capacity.“We believe there’s still too much refining capacity in the US and western Europe,” Bill Klesse, Valero chief executive said earlier this month during a conference call with investors. “Some things die hard,” he added.This article has been ammended since original publication to ccrrectly identify Antwerp as a Belgian city
161;COP;Conocophillips;2012-05-09T20:32:01Z;Weir hit as demand for fracking pumps falls;;Shares in Weir Group took another knock on Wednesday as a fall in demand for fracking equipment and concerns over a slowdown in spending by miners on new projects weighed on the industrial pump supplier.The FTSE 100 engineering group kept full-year profits guidance of about £470m, saying spending momentum in the mining sector would offset weakness in its US fracking and conventional oil and gas businesses.But shares in Weir, the biggest gainer in percentage value among constituents of London’s top index in 2010, fell 82p, or 5.1 per cent, to £15.14 following its first-quarter trading update, leaving them nearly a third below their year’s high of £22.43, reached in February.The company said new orders in its upstream oil and gas business had fallen 32 per cent. Hardest hit were orders for fracking pumps, used in the hydraulic fracturing of shale layers to extract oil and gas.Weir, which accounts for half of the US market in this segment, has been investing to expand manufacturing capacity to tackle six-month delivery times amid previous bottlenecks. However, a sharp decline in shale gas prices has led to an unwinding of forward orders and cancelling of $72m in last year’s orders.Keith Cochrane, chief executive, said a disruptive shift by the expanded North American fracking-rig fleet from gas towards more attractive oil-bearing shale has added to the sales fall.Chesapeake Energy and ConocoPhillips are among those to have announced cuts to shale gas drilling in response to US natural gas prices hitting a decade low.● FT CommentFor a pendulum to reach its point of equilibrium, it must gently dissipate its energy by oscillating around both sides of its eventual resting place. And Mr Cochrane, who leads the FTSE 100’s most shorted stock of the year so far, cautioned in January that expansion in manufacturing capacity for fracking equipment would see that market move into equilibrium. However, the question facing Weir’s investors is where that resting place should be. Weir is far more than a fracking play – as its weighty exposure to providing the slurry pumps that help drive the global mining sector shows. However, negative shifts in recommendations by some analysts on Wednesday signal the loss of Weir’s previous premium to capital goods stocks. The company now trades on a prospective multiple of 10 times – a chance to buy on weakness, perhaps. However, Weir shares appear akin to how Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake’s chief executive described American natural gas in January – if not “oversupplied” then “under-demanded”.
162;COP;Conocophillips;2012-05-07T18:05:44Z;Repsol warns rivals over investing in YPF;;Spain’s Repsol, stripped of a 51 per cent stake in Argentine oil company, YPF, by the government in Buenos Aires, has written to oil majors including Exxon, Chevron and ConcoPhillips warning it would sue if they try to invest in YPF or its assets.In letters sent on Monday and seen by the Financial Times, Repsol said it would take “actions and/or legal proceedings necessary to protect our investment … to prevent any improper interference or unfair competition by third parties seeking to take advantage of the current circumstances to directly or indirectly acquire interests in YPF assets in which we have an interest”.It said it could also sue companies which “profit at the expense [of Repsol]” or take any steps “prejudicing Repsol’s ability to fully defend and recover its rights”. The expropriation of YPF leaves Respol with a 6.4 per cent stake.Repsol, which has invested $300m in the huge Vaca Muerta shale reserves, has called the nationalisation “unconstitutional, discriminatory and unlawful”. It is writing to companies it had contacted before the expropriation about possible joint ventures in the area. “We are confident that we will count on your understanding and support,” it concluded.Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, last Friday promulgated the nationalisation law, which had been approved in Congress by a wide majority. She appointed Miguel Galuccio as new YPF chief until shareholders meet on June 4 to elect a new board.The Argentine government needs deep-pocketed partners to help YPF develop what are considered the world’s third-largest shale reserves – oil and gas trapped deep in the earth’s bedrock that require costly, high-tech drilling to extract.The two senior government officials put in charge of YPF by decree on April 16 have sounded out Total of France, Petrobras of Brazil and US companies Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Apache Corp about partnering YPF, but there have been no announcements.YPF has advanced further than its rivals in developing shale in Argentina, but industry sources said some companies had been prepared to pay $10,000 to $12,000 an acre to join forces to develop Vaca Muerta.With its conventional oil fields ageing, Argentina’s best hope of regaining energy self-sufficiency is through shale. The government says it had to spend $9.4bn last year importing energy because of underinvestment and underproduction by Repsol.Repsol’s threat of legal action puts companies with an interest in shale in a tricky position because they need to keep on the right side of the government in Argentina’s highly regulated energy industry.Repsol said earlier this year it had discovered 1.5bn barrels in contingent reserves it expected could be extracted – in Vaca Muerta, of which 1.2bn would be attibutable to YPF. Of that, 116m were classified as reserves, meaning the investment decision to develop them had been taken. In all, it said Vaca Muerta had total prospective reserves of more than 21bn barrels.With the lure of Vaca Muerta, Repsol had been in late-stage talks to sell its YPF stake to Sinopec of China before the expropriation. It was not immediately clear whether it had sent a letter to any Chinese company on Monday.
163;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Conoco’s new chief plans culture shake-up;;ConocoPhillips, the US oil and gas production company that has just demerged its refining and chemicals business, needs to change its culture to take advantage of its new status, its chief executive has said.In his first interview, Ryan Lance, who took over as chief executive on May 1, said Conoco was moving away from its position as a large integrated oil group, and trying to take on the dynamism of smaller exploration and production companies.“It’s going to look, feel and smell different …with a lot more drive and a lot more focus,” Mr Lance said.The demerger of the downstream business, Phillips 66, has made Conoco the world’s largest company by market capitalisation that is solely focused on oil and gas exploration and production.As well as refining, fuel stations, chemicals and pipelines, Phillips 66 has taken on research into technologies not related to oil and gas production, such as biofuels.Mr Lance said: “Getting the management and all our people focused on where we’re going and what we’re doing as a pure play E&P company, without all the other distractions that come with an integrated company, will create a step change in performance.”He said he wanted Conoco to take on some of the attributes of smaller independent companies, where staff collaborated better and were nimbler in their decision-making.He has been touring the company’s operations worldwide in the past four months to convey that message to its 16,000 staff, holding town hall meetings and setting out the strategy behind the demerger and explaining what it means for them.The duplication of some administrative functions required for the demerger has added about $75m-$100m after tax to Conoco’s costs in the first year, Mr Lance said, out of total costs of about $8bn, but that could be brought down over time.Mr Lance also said he thought the company’s settlement with Chinese authorities, following the spill of about 3,000 barrels of oil and drilling fluid from two Conoco operated platforms into the Bohai Bay last year, would draw a line under the incident.Conoco was last week given a fine and bill for restitution of the damage resulting from the accident totalling $192m.“We’re the largest upstream IOC [international oil company] producer in China today,” Mr Lance said.“China’s an important country, and it was important to resolve these issues so we could move forward with future opportunities in China.”
164;COP;Conocophillips;2012-05-01T16:39:35Z;Conoco break-up offers growth – and risks;;You might describe ConocoPhillips as a $92bn experiment.The challenge facing Ryan Lance, its new chief executive, is to make that experiment work.At the stroke of 12 on Monday night, the third-largest oil group in the US by market capitalisation formally divided itself into two: the upstream oil and gas production business, still called ConocoPhillips, and the downstream refining, marketing, chemicals and pipelines business, called Phillips 66.As of Tuesday morning, the former had a market capitalisation of $70bn, the latter about $22bn.By the excision of its downstream operations, Conoco has turned itself into an entirely new animal: a business focused on exploration and production, like an independent oil and gas company, but with the size and global scope of a major international oil group.Mr Lance now has the chance to prove that this strange organism, half-fish, half-fowl, can thrive and grow in a fiercely competitive industry.Many large oil companies have been urged by bankers and analysts to undergo the same surgery that Conoco has chosen. BP in particular has faced repeated calls for a break-up, particularly in the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.Yet there are some analysts who believe that the experiment is most likely to fail, and that Conoco will either have to be broken up further, or be taken over.As Mr Lance explains it, the strategic logic for integration – the same company owning every part of the supply chain, from the oilfield to the petrol pump – had worn very thin.“In the last decade, integration was important,” he says. Resource-rich countries, and their national oil companies, wanted partnerships to secure their access to refineries and customers in the US and Europe, and western companies had to offer a package including both expertise and technology for oil production, and a secure route to market.It is not easy to see, but Ryan Lance has a scar on his right hand from being cut in a fight while working as a roughneck on the oil rigs in Wyoming. That was a long time ago, but the scar is a permanent reminder that he has seen the industry, as he puts it, from “the ground up”.His background is a something of a contrast from his predecessor Jim Mulva, who has a master’s degree in business and finance from the University of Texas, and served as an officer in the US Navy. Mr Lance, 49, has a degree in petroleum engineering from Montana Tech, and put himself through college working summer jobs including driving water trucks and working on drilling rigs in Montana and Wyoming.“This business has been my passion for almost 30 years,” he says.He has a good reputation in the industry for his openness and honesty, and seems a generally popular appointment. A few years ago, though, it looked an unlikely outcome. In 2008 John Carrig, then chief financial officer, was appointed president and chief operating officer, in what looked like a clear signal that he was being groomed to replace Mr Mulva.In October 2010, though, in what was described as a “Wednesday afternoon massacre”, the company announced the departures of four senior executives, including Mr Carrig. It was only then that Mr Lance, who had been appointed to the role of senior vice-president for international exploration and production in 2009, emerged as a possible successor.The appointment of Mr Lance, with his engineering background, sends the message that the company aims to focus on technical excellence. It is also appropriate for a business that is putting the majority of its investment into North America. Starting with his first permanent job at Arco, the US group bought by BP in 2000, he has been based in the US for much of his career, having held engineering and management roles in Alaska, California and Texas. From 2003 to 2005, he was head of E&P for Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and the Caspian, based in Singapore.In typical oil industry fashion, he has had to be very mobile. His rise to the top, he says, is in part thanks to his wife and two children, who have been prepared to move nine times in the past 11 years.“But as the NOCs have increased their capabilities, now they’re really coming to companies and saying who’s got the best upstream technology, who’s got the best downstream capabilities, and it’s not necessarily [about] looking for an integrated package.”The physical integration of Conoco’s operations had become minimal. Only about 10 per cent of the crude it produced was fed into its own refineries.Financially, the refining and marketing operation was a large but low-return business, acting as a drag on the group’s appeal to investors. US and European fuels markets appear to have reached the point of “peak demand”, where rising efficiency, biofuels and electrification mean that petrol sales will never rise significantly above their present levels. BP, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have all been cutting back their refining operations in developed country markets. What Conoco has done, Mr Lance says, is pursue that trend to its logical conclusion in the most tax-efficient way for investors, by demerger.Arguments often cited against demerger have not turned out to be relevant, he adds. By removing the traditionally more stable downstream businesses, Conoco has increased its exposure to the volatility of oil and gas prices, but that is not expected to affect its credit rating. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, the rating agencies, have both said the company will have the same grade as a pure exploration and production company as it did when it was integrated.“As the largest independent E&P company in the world today, that credit rating and that balance sheet capacity we think is a differentiating and a distinctive attribute,” Mr Lance says.It is what makes possible what he calls its “unique” offer to investors: the prospect of 3-5 per cent average annual production growth during 2012-16 – significantly faster than Conoco’s integrated oil company peers have been managing – as well as a dividend yield of 3.7 per cent that is higher than for any other independent E&P company, and higher than for Exxon (2.2 per cent) and Chevron (3 per cent), the two largest US oil groups.“We call it a new class of investment. It is an opportunity to generate good growth – and competitive growth for the size company we are – plus a good underpinning yield that provides returns back to our shareholders, and they can count on it.”Conoco certainly appears to have the assets to make that work. It is strong in North America, one of the world’s fastest-growing regions for oil production, which is expected to take 60 per cent of the company’s annual $15bn capital spending budget for the foreseeable future. It has growth potential in the Canadian tar sands, in the Gulf of Mexico, where it has just invested heavily in new exploration acreage, in Alaska, and above all in the new onshore “unconventional” fields, unlocked by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, that are responsible for all the excitement about American oil: the Eagle Ford shale and Permian basin in Texas, and the Bakken shale in North Dakota.“North America is our home: it’s where we’re really good,” Mr Lance says. “We’re blessed with a great acreage position.”Internationally, it is expanding in the North Sea, Malaysia, and in liquefied natural gas in Australia. Having been burnt, like many western oil companies, in emerging economies – its seven-year ownership of a 20 per cent stake in Lukoil of Russia proved fruitless, for example – Conoco is now focusing principally on developed countries.Although those countries tend to have higher costs, Mr Lance believes that by shifting the company’s mix of output towards oil, and away from North American gas, for which prices are at a ten-year low, he can raise margins and improve returns at the same time as increasing production volumes.The decision to split the company was widely welcomed. “I think what they are doing makes a lot of sense,” says Phil Weiss of Argus Research.“It’s good to have an E&P company that you can put in your portfolio with the reassurance of the strong dividend. The one concern I would have would be about what would happen if there were a real collapse in oil prices.”However, other analysts and competitors speculate that Conoco’s attempt to give investors the best of both worlds may end up delivering neither, without the exciting growth of a successful independent, or the reliability of an integrated company.One possibility is that the group will be broken up still further, perhaps under pressure from an activist investor, to split off the more mature steadily producing oilfields from the fast-growing newer prospects. Another is that a bidder will come in to perform the same exercise.A market capitalisation of $70bn militates against either outcome, but if Mr Lance fails to perform, both are possible.“I think the focus and the transparency we’ll create as an upstream E&P company will create long-term value for our shareholders, and that’s what we’re focused on,” he says. The companies that have pondered a similar demerger will be watching his success or failure closely.
165;COP;Conocophillips;2012-04-30T22:51:24Z;Delta buys refinery to combat fuel costs;;Delta Air Lines, the second-biggest carrier in the world, has said it will purchase an oil refinery operation in Pennsylvania for about $150m in a bold move to tackle escalating fuel costs.Airlines have long been at the mercy of volatile fuel prices, which make up about one-third of their expenses, but for the most part they have responded by using financial tools, such as hedging contracts, to lock in prices or by cutting capacity to control costs.Delta said on Monday that moving into the oil refining business directly, a first for a US airline, would knock about $300m a year from its roughly $12bn fuel expense, all for a price equivalent to buying a single widebody aircraft.This “is an innovative approach to managing our largest expense”, said Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta. “This modest investment … will allow Delta to reduce its fuel expense and ensure jet fuel availability in the northeast.”In a presentation, Delta said it had been squeezed by rising jet fuel prices and limited availability of fuel on the US east coast, where shifting market dynamics have made refineries less profitable, leading the sector to idle, shut or sell about 50 per cent of capacity since 2010. Its fuel costs have gone up about $3.5bn between 2009 and 2011.Delta added that “crack spreads”, or the cost of converting oil into jet fuel, were rising even faster than the basic cost of crude. Such spikes are particularly painful for airlines as it is hard to hedge against crack spreads in a cost-effective manner.To tackle those problems, Delta said it would buy a refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, through a subsidiary, for $150m plus $30m supplied by the state. The facility can refine about 185,000 barrels a day and after a $100m upgrade, will produce about 52,000 barrels a day of jet fuel.Delta said it had reached a multiyear deal to source raw materials from BP and then to exchange the non-jet fuel refined products from the plant with BP and partners for more jet fuel. In total, the deal will provide for about 80 per cent of Delta’s domestic jet fuel needs.ConocoPhillips placed the refinery on the market in late 2011 after choosing to idle the plant, citing “severe market pressure.” Conoco is in the midst of breaking itself up into separate exploration and production and refining and pipeline units.Analysts offered mixed views on the Delta venture. Some lauded its novelty while others questioned whether Delta has the expertise to run a complex business far removed from its core skills.On Monday, Delta took pains to address those concerns, saying that it had hired an industry veteran to run the plant and arguing that it would benefit regardless of whether crack spreads rose or fell. Delta expects to close the transaction and complete the plant upgrades by the third quarter of 2012.Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer of Delta, said: “We expect the Trainer acquisition to be accretive to Delta’s earnings [and] expand our margins and to fully recover our investment in the first year of operations.”
166;COP;Conocophillips;2012-04-27T15:02:42Z;China issues $269m fine for oil spill;;China has issued its biggest fine for oil spill pollution, asking for Rmb1.7bn ($269m) from ConocoPhillips and Cnooc in compensation for environmental damage caused by oil seepage from their well in the Bohai Bay.Lax environmental standards in the world’s second-largest economy have left China with chronic pollution and the Bohai Bay spill last summer was the first time Chinese authorities had publicly tackled an oil spill from an offshore well in Chinese waters.The spill was very small relative to big oil spills such as Deepwater Horizon but served as a milestone for maritime authorities determined to prove their mettle following the Gulf of Mexico spill.Regulators required a total shutdown of all wells on the block where the spill occurred, and ConocoPhillips and Cnooc have submitted a fresh proposal for developing the block that is still awaiting government approval.Under Friday’s agreement, ConocoPhillips will pay Rmb1.1bn to resolve environmental claims related to the spill, and a further Rmb113m to support environmental initiatives in Bohai Bay. ConocoPhillips was the operator of the wells when the spills occurred. Cnooc, Conoco’s partner with a 51 per cent stake in the block, will pay Rmb480m to support environmental initiatives in Bohai Bay.The Bohai Bay is heavily polluted by industrial run-off from Beijing and Tianjin, and the deterioration of the bay has been a growing source of concern for Chinese leaders.Oil analyst Gordon Kwan of Mirae Asset Securities said Chinese regulators were taking offshore oil pollution more seriously following the Deepwater Horizon incident.“They don’t want that disaster to be repeated in China,” Mr Kwan said. “China is becoming a first-world country and they realise that aggressive production of energy cannot come at the cost of the environment.”China’s State Oceanic Administration said on Friday that “significant progress” had been made in oil spill compensation. The agency added that money from the fines would be used for purposes including ecological construction, environmental protection, restoring damaged marine life and monitoring the impact of the oil spill in Bohai Bay.
167;COP;Conocophillips;2012-04-26T21:08:04Z;GM chief’s pay triples to $7.7m;;The pay of Daniel Akerson, General Motors chief executive, tripled to $7.7m last year, but the company has warned that US government restrictions on executive pay could limit the carmaker’s competitiveness.Mr Akerson took home a base salary of $1.7m plus $5.9m in stock and cash related to the company’s stock price, GM said in a proxy statement filed on Thursday. The company had targeted a total package of $9m but that was reduced by a 45 per cent fall in GM’s stock last year. In 2010, the year he took charge of the company, Mr Akerson earned $2.5m.By comparison Alan Mulally, Ford’s chief executive, was awarded a package worth $29.5m in 2011, making him the best-paid executive among Detroit’s “Big Three”. Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat and Chrysler, earned $19m in stock and salary last year, but none of that came from Chrysler, the company has said.GM said that Mr Akerson’s pay package placed him in the lowest quarter of executives among a grouping of large multinational companies including Ford, ExxonMobil and General Electric.GM executives’ pay is limited by the US government, which still owns about 30 per cent of the carmaker following its $50bn bailout in 2009. The US Treasury has frozen 2012 pay at 2011 levels for GM, AIG and Ally Financial, the last three companies bailed out at the height of the financial crisis that have not repaid their loans. GM still owes the Treasury $23.4bn.The company said in its proxy statement that the pay limits may cramp its competitiveness and potential growth.“Recognising and rewarding these key contributors and competing with other large, multinational employers to attract and retain fresh talent with critical skill sets is extremely difficult within the compensation constraints imposed” by the government, GM said.“Our ‘pay-for performance’ compensation philosophy would ordinarily allow us to reward the executives responsible for our superior performance in 2011 on a more targeted, competitive basis than what has been prescribed by [government] regulations.”GM’s net profit almost doubled to a record $7.6bn last year on the strength of its US sales, which offset losses in its troubled European business.The highest paid GM executive in 2011 was Thomas Stephens, the chief technology officer who retired earlier this month and earned $8.3m. Stephen Girsky, the chairman of Opel tasked with turning around GM’s European performance, earned $5.3m.GM also said on Thursday that it was nominating James Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the oil company, and Theodore Solso, former head of Cummins, the engine maker, to its executive board.“Mr Mulva’s expertise in the energy industry will provide valuable insight to our board in developing GM’s long-term strategy,” the company said.
168;COP;Conocophillips;2012-04-26T00:52:37Z;Exxon and Chevron raise dividends;;ExxonMobil and Chevron, the two largest US oil companies by market capitalisation, have sharply increased their dividends in a sign of confidence in future earnings. Exxon raised its quarterly dividend by 21 per cent, and Chevron by 11 per cent.Exxon, which reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday, declared a dividend of 57 cents a share for the second quarter, up from 47 cents in the first quarter.The consensus of analysts’ forecasts is that earnings will have fallen compared to the equivalent period of 2011, under pressure from weak US natural gas prices and a fall in production.However, the increase in the dividend indicates confidence in the long term outlook and brings Exxon closer to the other large US oil groups in terms of dividend yield.At Wednesday’s closing price of $86.85, Exxon’s shares would yield 2.6 per cent if the dividend were continued at 57 cents per quarter.Chevron, which reports first-quarter earnings on Friday, declared a dividend of 90 cents for the second quarter, up from 81 cents in the first. At Chevron’s Wednesday closing price of $103.85, that dividend maintained for a year would give a yield of 3.5 per cent.John Watson, Chevron’s chief executive, said: “We continue to share our success with our shareholders in the form of meaningful dividend growth. This reflects the strength of our current portfolio and our confidence in the company’s compelling growth prospects.”He added that 2012 marked 100 years of dividend payments by Chevron and its predecessor companies.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, this week reiterated its commitment to sustaining a high dividend payment after the demerger of its refining, marketing, chemicals and pipelines business takes effect on May 1.Conoco’s shares yield 3.7 per cent, higher than either Exxon’s or Chevron’s, based on the past four quarters’ dividends and a closing share price on Wednesday of $71.02.
169;COP;Conocophillips;2012-04-23T23:30:31Z;ConocoPhillips pledges to keep high dividend;;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil group by market capitalisation, has committed to sustaining a relatively high dividend payout after its demerger takes effect on May 1.The demerger, splitting off the group’s downstream refining and marketing operations into a new company, Phillips 66, will leave ConocoPhillips as the world’s largest business operating solely as an oil and gas explorer and producer.Exploration and production companies typically pay little or no dividend, but Jeff Sheets, Conoco’s chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call that the company was large and stable enough to pay out 20-25 per cent of its cash flow.Mr Sheets added: “We recognise that that’s going [to] give us a pretty high yield going out of the box, but we think that’s an issue not with the dividend but with the share price. That’s going be something that will change over time.”Conoco’s dividend yield is about 3.7 per cent, based on dividends of $2.64 over the past year and a share price that closed at $72.33 on Monday, down 0.8 per cent. That compares to yields of 2.2 per cent for ExxonMobil and 3.2 per cent for Chevron, the two largest US oil groups.Mr Sheets was speaking as Conoco reported disappointing earnings for the first quarter, hit by a fall in production due to disposals, weak natural gas prices and a squeeze on refining margins.However, Ryan Lance, the new chief executive of the oil and gas production business that will remain ConocoPhillips, repeated his commitment to 3 per cent to 5 per cent annual production growth and 3 per cent to 5 per cent annual margin improvement.Oil and gas production volumes in the first quarter were down 4 per cent on the equivalent period of 2011 at an average of 1.64m barrels of oil equivalent per day, but that was entirely due to disposals and the temporary shutdown following spills last year at its operation in Bohai Bay in China.Conoco has been selling assets, including its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil of Russia, in what has been described as a “shrink to grow” strategy, rationalising the company to help future expansion.It has also bought back 16 per cent of its shares since 2010, including a further $1.9bn in the first quarter.The oil and gas production division reported a 3 per cent drop in earnings to $2.13bn, excluding special items, while the refining, marketing, pipeline and chemicals businesses being spun off into the new Phillips 66 company reported a 1 per cent rise to $755m.Overall, earnings per share were $2.02 for the group, excluding one-offs such as profits on asset sales. That was 11 per cent higher on the equivalent period of 2011, but below analysts’ average forecast of $2.08.The boost from higher oil prices was offset by lower US prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids such as ethane.The chemicals business, which uses natural gas liquids as a feedstock, was one of the best-performing segments, with profits up an underlying 13 per cent at $218m.For the year as a whole, oil and gas production is expected to decline further to 1.55m-1.6m barrels of oil equivalent per day, as a result of refits, maintenance and seasonal declines in the second and third quarters, as well as further disposal impacts.However, the company also highlighted coming growth opportunities including the North Sea, Malaysia, Australia and onshore and offshore US.
170;COP;Conocophillips;2012-04-12T20:56:58Z;Wall St extends rally on earnings hopes;;Wall Street brushed aside a second consecutive downbeat jobs report as shares in LinkedIn jumped more than 8 per cent and rumours of a stronger than expected growth figure from China lifted markets on Thursday.The online professional networking site was buoyed by an analyst note that raised the price target for shares in the LinkedIn to $115, saying that a hiring spree has not hurt the company’s margins.“LinkedIn has been rapidly expanding its field sales teams to capture share of large and growing opportunities in the worldwide talent acquisition and online advertising markets,” said Scott Devitt, analyst at Morgan Stanley.“While sales hires typically take [about] two quarters to generate enough revenue to cover their own compensation costs – leading to “ramping” employees comprising nearly 50 per cent of total sales staff in some periods – LinkedIn managed to maintain revenue per average sales head at 75 to 80 per cent of its peak levels,” he added.The company’s shares gained 8.4 per cent to $105.90, moving back above the $100 mark for the first time since retreating from highs achieved last Wednesday. Shares in LinkedIn are now up more than 68 per cent on the year.The S&P 500 materials, energy and industrials indices were all up more than 2 per cent on the day as rumours swirled through the market that Friday’s gross domestic product report from China would be stronger than expected.Among the top gainers on those sub-indices were coalminers Alpha Natural Resources, up nearly 10 per cent at $16.08, and copper and gold-miner Freeport-McMoRan, 5.9 per cent higher at $37.89.Overall, the S&P 500 made strong gains for a second straight session, adding 1.4 per cent to 1,387.57, but the benchmark index remains almost 2.5 per cent lower than its cyclical high achieved last Monday.Of the recent losses, Justin Waters at Bespoke Investment Group said: “Investors have been extremely skittish throughout this entire bull market due to the bad taste left in their mouths from the crash during the financial crisis.”But equities shook off a fresh jobs report that showed first-time claims for jobless benefits rose last week to 380,000, the highest level in two-and-a-half months. The figure, which went up by 13,000 in the week to April 7, came in worse than analysts’ estimates of 359,000.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 12,986.58, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.3 per cent to 3,055.55.Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the Vix index of implied equity volatility, fell back below 20 after steadily rising over the S&P’s recent slide. The Vix was more than 14 per cent lower to 17.24.McKesson, the largest drug distributor in the US by revenue, said it had beaten its competitors to win an important government contract to act as the prime pharmaceutical supplier for the Department of Veterans Affairs.The initial two-year contract will allow the company to continue to supply more than 700 locations, including 270 medical centres, with drugs for veterans of the US military. The contract can be extended for up to an additional six years, making it worth as much as $31.6bn according to estimates.Shares in McKesson rose 3.9 per cent to $91.34 on news of the win.Elsewhere, Bed, Bath & Beyond edged up 0.1 per cent to $70.14 as the home goods retailer had its equity downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by analysts at Canaccord Genuity, who said there was limited upside to shares at their present level.Laura Champine, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said: “We calculate that Bed, Bath & Beyond’s market share declined in [its fourth quarter] for the first time this decade, and we expect a deceleration of top-and-bottom line growth in [its current financial year] and beyond.”Delta Air Lines, whose 2011 fuel costs were $11.8bn last year, was among the morning’s top risers, gaining 3.5 per cent to $10.26. The Atlanta-based US carrier could save up to 10 per cent a year on its fuel needs if it goes ahead with the purchase of an oil refinery in Pennsylvania, according to reports citing a person familiar with the discussions between Delta and ConocoPhillips.A deal, if completed, would be a unique effort by an airline to save on hefty fuel costs, which for Delta accounted for more than one-third of its annual spending.Better than expected sales in the first quarter by the personal computer industry helped shares in Hewlett-Packard gain 7.2 per cent to $25.10. The world’s largest maker of personal computers was among the day’s best performing equities after a report from Gartner, the researching firm, that said total global shipments rose 1.9 per cent to 89 million units in the first quarter.Groupon, the offers and daily deals website, rose 3.7 per cent to $13.56, moving away from an all-time low struck earlier in the week. Shares in the company are down more than 32 per cent from its debut price of $20 last November.Aluminium manufacturer Alcoa continued to add to its gains after reporting better than expected first-quarter results. Shares in the company rose another 2.7 per cent to $10.17.
171;COP;Conocophillips;2012-04-09T19:45:28Z;Energy: Refined out of existence;As petrol prices rise and western demand shrinks, refineries are closing across the developed world;"Sunoco petrol stations are a fixture of the US eastern seaboard, their blue-and-yellow awnings touting the brand’s status as official fuel of Nascar racing. But after July, none of the petrol they sell will actually be made by Sunoco.The 126-year-old company’s decision to quit the refining business is the latest sign of the tumult in downstream fuel markets that is accompanying a global shift in oil use. As consumption flags in developed economies and grows in emerging markets, refineries are dying from Japan to Pennsylvania, the Sunoco home state where oil wells drilled in the 1850s begat the petroleum age.The upheaval highlights the challenges facing policy makers as rising petrol prices endanger growth in the world’s biggest economy. Washington has floated largely predictable responses: drill more, punish speculators, work harder towards energy self-sufficiency. But global trading on markets for petrol, diesel and heating oil highlight the persistent fact of America’s energy interdependence.Half the refining capacity on the populous US east coast is set to disappear. Sunoco has pulled the plug on two refineries already and warns that another in Philadelphia will close in July if no buyer steps forward. ConocoPhillips is trying to sell a refinery in Pennsylvania, idle since last year. On May 1, it will spin off its refining business. More than 3m barrels of daily refinery capacity have closed in western countries, since the financial crisis, says the International Energy Agency, the west’s oil watchdog. Emerging economies have meanwhile added 4.2m b/d in capacity, with another 1.8m b/d coming this year. “It’s really a tale of two markets,” says Toril Bosoni, IEA senior oil analyst. “You have very contrasting pictures for economic growth and demand, and refining is reflecting what’s going on elsewhere.”A good vantage point is Marcus Hook, a borough of 2,400 people squeezed into Pennsylvania’s industrial south-east corner. J.N. Pew, founder of the Sun Oil Company, built a refinery there in 1901 to process crude borne by ships from the legendary Texas gusher known as Spindletop. It was one of many refineries to line the wide Delaware river. “If you were a child who grew up in this region, the refineries have been part of [its] fabric …from the first moments of awareness,” says Patrick Meehan, a Republican congressman who represents the area. Among his memories: “The smell.”Late last year, Sunoco put the Marcus Hook plant on the auction block and stopped feeding it crude after losing nearly $1bn in the past three years at its east coast refineries. The problems began at the docks. Marcus Hook relied on foreign oil delivered by tanker including 34.6m barrels from Nigeria, 5m from Norway, 3.3m from Angola and 3m from Azerbaijan last year, government records show.Low in sulphur and yielding lots of high-value products such as petrol, this was some of the most expensive oil on the planet. Nigeria’s Qua Iboe, a representative variety, averaged $114 a barrel in 2011. For several weeks, a barrel of Qua Iboe cost more than a barrel of reformulated gasoline blendstock, ensuring negative margins for refineries such as Marcus Hook. West Texas Intermediate crude, similar in quality, averaged just $95 last year. Texas oil production rose 25 per cent to top half a billion barrels for the first time since 1998. But Marcus Hook could not buy it, as no pipelines link it with Texas.“You’ve got crude oil in this country. It’s just a question of getting it to where the refineries are,” says Denis Stephano, labour union president at ConocoPhillips’s mothballed Pennsylvania refinery. In his union hall, Mr Stephano points to a map of the US’s piecemeal pipeline system, which hangs next to a placard reading “Save refineries, save lives!”In Washington, the signature energy battle of the past year has been over the Keystone XL pipeline, which a company wants to build to connect Alberta’s oil sands with Texas. This would be likely to raise depressed Canadian prices but would do little to save refineries such as Marcus Hook. Most Canadian oil is too heavy to be processed there.Crude oil prices soared back above $100 a barrel last year as the revolution in Libya halted production. The gains for crude outpaced the rise in petrol prices, which began to rally in earnest only after news of the latest refinery closures in the US and Europe. Petroplus, Europe’s largest independent refiner, filed for insolvency in January and has been lining up buyers for five plants.Keeping a lid on refined fuel prices has been weak consumption. US petrol demand has fallen steadily since 2007 as cars became more fuel-efficient, fuel marketers blended more corn-based ethanol into their product and high unemployment kept highway travel light. This wedged refineries between high input costs and a poor appetite for their fuel. “The downstream industry is the flywheel in the oil system,” says Kevin Lindemer, an oil industry consultant. “Right now we’re seeing big changes on both sides of the flywheel.”The US story is echoed throughout the west. Oil demand in Europe contracted by 320,000 b/d last year, the IEA says. Emerging-world demand more than offset these falls, led by countries that Barclays has nicknamed “Bics” – Brazil, India, China and Saudi Arabia. In the past five years their oil demand has grown by 5.1m b/d, while demand everywhere else has declined by 1.4m b/d, says Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at the UK-based bank.Perched on the coast of Gujarat in north-western India, Reliance Industries’ petroleum mega-complex at Jamnagar is often dubbed “the refining hub of the world”. With a daily capacity of more than 1.3m barrels, the facility is both the planet’s largest single refinery and an important source of petrol and diesel for fast-growing Asian markets.But for Dhirubhai Ambani, Reliance’s billionaire founder, building the complex was also the fulfilment of a lifetime’s ambition, as he rose from working-class roots to create one of India’s largest and most profitable companies. India liberalised its previously state-dominated refining sector in the 1990s, allowing the tycoon to build the facility.Construction was not trouble-free – halfway through a fierce cyclone hit the area, destroying part of the facility and delaying its opening – but on completion in 2000 the refinery stood as India’s largest-ever industrial investment. Mukesh Ambani, the eldest son, added a second, neighbouring plant in 2008, taking the company’s total investment to $16bn.Rather than serving India’s growing market, the majority of its output is shipped back abroad, in part because the more recently built half of the facility is in an export-only special economic zone, while its coastal location allows for easy access to oil supplies.“The great advantage to being in Jamnagar is three-day shipping for crude from the Middle East,” says Sanjay Mookim, an oil and gas analyst at Credit Suisse in Mumbai. “Most of their product is then turned around back out to Asia, and especially China, although some of it goes to Europe and elsewhere too.”Even with such a huge facility, Reliance cannot protect itself entirely from the vagaries of the global oil market. If refining margins decline, the result feeds through to the conglomerate’s profitability, as shown in its most recent quarterly results.Even so, Jamnagar has always aimed at the record books – an ambition that even stretched to increasing the size of a neighbouring forest. A biography of the elder Ambani tells of his asking whether the 66,000-tree mangrove plantation next door was also the world’s largest. An executive researched the issue and discovered reports of a Mughal emperor who once owned a 100,000-strong plantation.Reliance promptly ordered more than 30,000 extra trees, just to be sure its complex would be in good company.Politicians have taken up the cudgels over US petrol prices even though by international standards they remain among the world’s cheapest. The energy policy plan on the campaign website of Mitt Romney, leading Republican contender for the presidency, says his administration would “permit drilling wherever it can be done safely” but does not mention oil refining. The re-election campaign of President Barack Obama says that he is “moving us toward energy independence”.US crude production is at its highest in eight years, helping reduce imports. But the US petroleum market is at once global and regional, underscoring how simplistic ideas of energy independence can be in internationally traded commodity markets. The Gulf of Mexico coast, home to 43 per cent of refining capacity and able to consume cheaper crudes, has turned the US into a net exporter of petroleum products for the first time since at least 1949. The inland US, enjoying a surfeit of fresh crude supplies, has been selling discounted petrol into landlocked markets. The west coast is isolated from the rest of the country, while the east coast has historically relied on imported fuel. “The US is really four markets when it comes to products,” says Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup and a former US oil official.If its refineries close as planned, the east coast will become even more dependent on imported petrol. Europe, which traditionally has extra petrol, could be joined by other exporters to New York harbour, the traditional pricing point for US gasoline. “One of the most probable incremental suppliers is India,” the Energy Information Administration, a government agency, says in an analysis.It could take higher prices in east coast cities to draw more fuel carriers across the ocean. Wholesale gasoline last week traded at record prices in Europe, according to Bloomberg. The EIA warns of price spikes: “In the longer run, higher prices and possibly higher price volatility can result from longer supply chains.”Sunoco says it is helping cushion against supply disruptions by adding more tanks to a New Jersey refinery it converted into a storage facility in 2011. More storage could also be added to Marcus Hook, but local officials worried about losing tax revenue have proposed a local zoning amendment disallowing the storage of fuels not manufactured on the premises. “We would hope that they recognise this has been a good home to their refinery for 110 years,” says Bruce Dorbian, borough manager. “What about their corporate responsibility?”As big eastern US cities search for replacement fuel sources, Gujarat in India may even hold the advantage over the Gulf of Mexico. The reasons are part infrastructural, part legal.The Colonial Pipeline, the main petroleum products line running from Houston to the north-east, is nearly full. A planned expansion will add less capacity than that of the Philadelphia refinery destined to close. This leaves tankers, which the Jones Act of 1920 requires to fly the US flag and employ American crews if they are ferrying products between US ports. A debate is raging over whether there are enough, or at least cheap enough, vessels to ship fuel eastwards.The EIA says a limited number of Jones Act tankers are free to carry refined products from the Gulf to the east coast, while Jones Act barges can cost three times more than hiring a tanker from Europe. Morten Arntzen, chief executive of OSG, a tanker company, counters: “Transportation is a really minuscule part of the delivery cost of gasoline.”…The Delaware river oil corridor has been here before. In the 1870s, when capacity was just tens of thousands of barrels a day, “refiners found themselves in a serious plight”, according to a Pennsylvania oil industry history by Ernest Miller. “Refining capacity was more than double the production of crude. Naturally, few refineries operated at their full rate; many lost money and then shut down.”The answer then was the establishment of the South Improvement Company, a precursor to the Standard Oil monopoly. The group colluded with railways in an attempt to drive other refiners to ruin. That scheme today would be not only illegal but impossible, as US refiners compete with others abroad, linked by tankers. Indeed, as refineries have closed in Europe and the US the “crack spread” – the notional profit margin for turning crude into products – has jumped back into the black. This has led to speculation that a last-minute buyer could rescue the large 335,000 b/d Philadelphia refinery.Even as the western refinery industry faces overcapacity, sophisticated operations able to turn cheap, viscous crudes into high-quality products have been expanding. In India, Reliance Industries has built the world’s biggest refinery complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat state. Motiva, a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell, will this year add 325,000 b/d of capacity at a Port Arthur, Texas refinery that will make it the largest in the US. Down river from Philadelphia, a New Jersey company called PBF Energy recently bought two refineries that can process cheaper, heavier crude than their neighbours. PBF, led by Tom O’Malley, a veteran refining investor who until last year chaired Petroplus, says in its prospectus its refineries are “well positioned” to profit from the “continued rationalisation” of refining capacity on either side of the Atlantic.Such benefits, however, are lost on consumers. Refinery closures appear baffling to Americans paying more with each stop at a petrol station. At a battered Sunoco station near Marcus Hook, manager Michele Stamm has been raising prices by six cents a gallon every two days. “It doesn’t make sense,” she says. A customer, an older local woman, walks in. “Can you imagine what we’re going to be paying if all these refineries close?” she asks."
172;COP;Conocophillips;2012-04-03T23:21:07Z;Icahn says investors support CVR bid;;A battle for control of CVR Energy is looming after Carl Icahn said shareholders had tendered about 55 per cent of the oil refiner’s outstanding shares to him in response to the corporate raider’s hostile bid.Mr Icahn, CVR’s largest shareholder with 14.5 per cent, said he would extend his $30 a share offer to buy it to the end of April.“I stand ready, willing and able to pay $2.26bn to purchase all CVR shares that I don’t currently own as soon as the board permits me to do so,” he said in a letter to CVR.The billionaire launched the bid in February, and has said that if successful, he would seek to sell the company on.But soon after he disclosed his stake and pushed the company to sell itself in January, CVR adopted a poison pill defence.If any investor gains ownership of more than 15 per cent of stock without approval, the board may issue equity to dilute the acquirer’s stake and stop them gaining control.CVR said Mr Icahn could not purchase any shares tendered in his offer and such shares could be withdrawn at any time.“The real choice for stockholders will be at our annual meeting [next month], where they will decide whether to elect Mr Icahn’s handpicked nominees in place of our qualified and experienced board,” it said.Mr Icahn said: “In light of the clear message that shareholders have now sent to the board, it would be a shame if the board took any action to thwart or delay our offer.” He has also threatened a proxy fight for control if CVR continues to rebuff his approach.CVR, based in Sugarland, Texas, owns oil refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as a majority stake in a fertiliser business.The location of the companies operations means that it has benefited from lower prices for crude in the Midwest than on the coast. Its shares closed up 6 per cent at $28.80. The stock is up more than 50 per cent so far this year.The $30 a share bid would value the company at $2.6bn. Mr Icahn has proposed to give shareholders as much as $7 a share on top of the initial offer if the company is sold, with possible trade buyers including Valero Energy, ConocoPhillips or Marathon Petroleum.
173;COP;Conocophillips;2012-04-01T04:29:57Z;European groups lead way on ESG;Eiris believes tighter legislation is behind the higher scores in Europe;UK and continental European companies have outstripped their US and Asian counterparts in taking a “ socially responsible” approach to their business and reducing risk, according to findings based on more than 2,500 FTSE global companies by Eiris, the responsible investment research specialist.A fifth of UK companies scored A (the highest of five grades) based on environmental, social and governance issues, followed by 12 per cent of mainland European ones. But only 2 per cent of US companies and 1 per cent of Asian ones made the top grade in Eiris’s recently launched Global Sustainability Ratings.“Tighter ESG legislation in Europe and more public awareness, especially in the UK, contributes to the difference in performance,” said Mark Robertson, spokesman for Eiris. “US companies are generally less engaged on many corporate social responsibility and ESG issues,” he added.The highest ranked companies among the 50 largest global businesses by market capitalisation included Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical group, and GlaxoSmithKline, its UK rival, while laggards included US oil and gas producers Chevron and ConocoPhillips.Demand from investors for a definitive assessment of corporate sustainability performance that can be easily fed into investment analysis triggered the launch of the ratings, said Mr Robertson.
174;COP;Conocophillips;2012-03-30T23:11:16Z;Oil groups agree on Alaska gas project;Resolution of lease dispute expedites export plan;ExxonMobil, BP and ConocoPhillips have reached agreement with the state of Alaska to take a significant step forward on a $40bn-plus project to export liquefied natural gas to Asia, resolving a long-running lease dispute that had been holding up progress.In a joint letter, the chief executives of the three companies said they were “aligned” on a plan to develop the huge gas reserves of Alaska’s North Slope, which until now have been stranded without a route to market.They have agreed on a target of 2016 for making a commitment to a large-scale export project, which they said would require an “unprecedented” investment in the state.Sean Parnell, Alaska’s governor, who has been pushing the companies to do more to develop the North Slope reserves, described the statement as a “historic” event.The most commercially attractive solution for North Slope gas is to build a pipeline to Alaska’s south coast and a plant to produce LNG for fast-growing Asian markets, at an estimated total cost of $40bn-$50bn.Exxon, BP and Conoco, together with TransCanada, the pipeline group, will now work on identifying a specific project, including a timetable, a route for the pipeline and a site for the LNG plant.The companies hope to resolve those issues within a year.An important obstacle has been removed with the end of the dispute over Point Thomson, a large North Slope field that holds about a quarter of the region’s gas reserves.The state had been seeking to take back leases on the field, arguing that the companies there, principally Exxon, BP, Conoco and Chevron, had been too slow to start production. The first development plan was agreed in 1977.The companies have now promised to start the first commercial production of condensate, a liquid that can be used to make fuels or petrochemicals, by May 1 2016. Chevron has dropped out, assigning its interest to Exxon on undisclosed terms.There are also two deadlines for the companies to decide on a “major gas sale”, a project to sell at least 500m cubic feet of gas per day from the North Slope.By 2016, they have to commit to such a project or make alternative investments. By the end of 2019, if they have still not given the go-ahead, they would lose some of the leases on Point Thomson.The North Slope has proven reserves of 35tn cubic feet of gas – about one-eighth of US total reserves – and undiscovered resources estimated at 236tn cu ft.Almost 90 per cent of Alaska’s gas output, which comes out of the ground alongside oil production, is simply reinjected back into the field, because there is no way to sell it.Exxon and TransCanada have been working on a route to take the gas across Canada to the “lower 48” US states, but the low price of North American gas resulting from the shale revolution makes that option unattractive.LNG can sell in Japan and China for more than seven times the US benchmark gas price.The LNG proposal still has to clear commercial and regulatory hurdles.In their letter, the three chief executives said: “Commercialising Alaska natural gas resources will not be easy. There are many challenges and issues that must be resolved, and we cannot do it alone.”They added: “Unprecedented commitments of capital for gas development will require competitive and stable fiscal terms.”Frank Harris, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, warned that the plan was not guaranteed “smooth sailing”, facing competition in Asian markets from other suppliers such as Australia and east Africa, and possibly political difficulties in the US.Ed Markey, a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, has already attacked the plan, saying: “If we export America’s natural gas to China, we might as well export our manufacturing jobs with it.”Mr Harris said: “Even though the gas is arguably stranded and therefore LNG is a sensible monetisation option, it is still in the US and therefore highly likely to be impacted by the current uncertainty around export licences and revocation. More clarity on US gas export policy will be needed for buyers to take it seriously.”Energy exports from Alaska have proved contentious in the past. For most of the time since the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline was opened in 1977, there has been a legal requirement for any crude sent through it to be shipped to the rest of the US.However, there is already a project on Alaska’s south coast that sends LNG to Japan.
175;COP;Conocophillips;2012-03-27T19:07:19Z;US natural gas prices at 10-year low;;US natural gas prices fell to a fresh 10-year low on Tuesday as supply growth continues, adding to pressure on drillers to curb production to avoid further falls as temperatures rise.Nymex April natural gas fell to a session low of $2.176 per million British thermal unit, down 2.2 per cent, and below the previous 10-year low of $2.204 per mBtu set earlier this month. The April contract expired at the end of business on Tuesday. The more actively traded May contract was at $2.285 per mBtu.The recent drop has taken prices nearly 5 per cent below the level that in mid-January prompted US natural gas producers including Chesapeake Energy and ConocoPhillips to reveal plans to reduce output and shift drilling into oil.The announced production cuts boosted prices, albeit briefly, in late January. The cost of the benchmark Henry Hub gas climbed from a low of $2.3 per mBtu in mid-January to a high of $2.8 per mBtu in a week, a rally of about 25 per cent. But since then prices have resumed their downward trajectory.Michael Zenker, natural gas analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, said in a note to clients that although some producers were now expecting a reduction in supply this year, the production guidance from the top-20 producers was still pointing to “moderate” growth of about 3 per cent for 2012.One reason why production remains strong in spite of decade-low prices is that drilling rigs have been moved from so-called “dry gas” wells, which produce only gas, to “wet wells” that produce a mixture of gas, oil and so-called natural gas liquids, which are used for petrochemicals.With oil prices above $125 a barrel and even higher for natural gas liquids, companies keep production high to profit from their oil and natural gas liquids output and consider gas a by-product.US gas production last year hit a record high, surpassing the previous peak set in 1973, after companies tapped shale reservoirs, using a technique called hydraulic fracturing, known as “fracking”. US gas production has risen more than 17 per cent over the last decade, according to the US Department of Energy.US natural gas costs have tumbled more than 85 per cent from the all-time high of more than $15 per mBtu set in late 2005.The weakness in natural gas prices is extending to contracts for forward delivery, putting pressure on drillers as prices for several years’ time, which influence longer-term investment plans, have also tumbled. Forward prices as far as December 2017 traded on Tuesday at below the $5 per mBtu level that most companies consider necessary to make an adequate return on capital on their projects.
176;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Let the gas flow;US should not stand in the way of its energy exports;Resource nationalism is a phenomenon that has troubled American oil companies in many parts of the world, from Venezuela to Russia. They are not used to being confronted by it at home.Yet that is what is happening now over plans to export liquefied natural gas from the US. When the FT reported last week that ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and BP were working towards a preliminary agreement on a $40bn-plus project to export LNG from Alaska to Asia, Ed Markey, a Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, immediately denounced it as “a threat to American manufacturers, farmers and families”.Mr Markey is often outside the mainstream of US politics. On the issue of LNG exports, though, he has a wide range of allies, including both environmental campaigners and some businesses.The case for reserving American gas for American buyers is vaporous, however. Industrial energy users are calling for increased scrutiny of LNG exports, if not yet an outright ban, because they worry about losing the competitive advantage of low gas prices created by the US shale boom.Yet while exports would probably drive up prices somewhat, the American advantage is so great – Asian LNG costs seven times as much as gas in the US – it could survive the increase quite comfortably. In the long term, the main factor for prices will be production costs. Changes in demand will have a greater effect on the volume supplied than on the price.If the logic of restricting exports from the “lower 48” states is questionable, the argument for doing so in Alaska is raging nonsense. Gas on Alaska’s North Slope is, in effect, valueless today because it has no route to market. The solution favoured by Mr Markey, a pipeline connection to the rest of the US, flies in the face of the commercial realities of low prices. The LNG project still faces many hurdles, but it is the only idea that could make financial sense.There are still large uncertainties over global gas markets, including the true size of the recoverable resource in the US, and the speed at which China will develop its own shale reserves. The government cannot be expected to do any better at addressing those questions than the private sector.The US administration should resist calls to get in the way of LNG exports. In the case of the Alaska project, an obvious benefit to the economy and to world energy supplies, it should see if there is anything it can do to help.
177;COP;Conocophillips;2012-03-21T18:54:30Z;Alaska champions $40bn pipeline plan;;BP, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips are in discussions about a $40bn project to export liquefied natural gas from Alaska to Asia, potentially opening up large but stranded reserves that currently have no route to market.According to people close to the negotiations, the three companies and state authorities hope to reach agreement next week over a long-running lease dispute at Point Thomson, a large oil and gas field on Alaska’s North Slope.A settlement would clear the way for the companies to hasten their commercial assessment of a large gas pipeline to Alaska’s southern coast, from where LNG could be shipped to China and other Asian countries. Sean Parnell, Alaska’s governor and a champion of the project, told the Financial Times he was “cautiously optimistic” that the plan would be able to move forward.The state argues that BP, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron have been too slow to produce oil and gas at Point Thomson, having agreed to a development plan in 1977, and he wants to take their lease away. John Minge, BP’s president for exploration in Alaska, told reporters in the state last week that talks about the dispute were on track to be resolved by an end of March deadline.Alaska’s North Slope has proven reserves of 35tn cubic feet of gas – about one-eighth of US total reserves – and undiscovered resources estimated at 236tn cu ft. Without a pipeline, however, the gas is worthless.Exxon and TransCanada, a pipeline company, have been working on a route to take the gas across Canada to the “lower 48” US states, but industry executives and government officials say the proposal was stymied by weak prices stemming from the shale gas boom.Mr Parnell said Alaska was frustrated by the slow progress of plans to develop the gas, which could earn the state an estimated $400bn. He has been urging the companies to move forward with a shorter pipeline to the south coast of Alaska, where a new LNG plant could be built for export to Asia. “The gas is there, the market is there, particularly on the Pacific Rim,” he said. “There is no reason why we should not be able to move the gas to the market.”The companies have warned that they need to assess the commercial case for the project, which would cost an estimated $40bn-$50bn and take at least 10 years to develop.
178;COP;Conocophillips;2012-03-16T20:39:11Z;China sets target for shale gas development;;"China has released its first five-year plan for the development of shale gas, setting ambitious production targets and emphasising the need for foreign co-operation and better technology in developing the sector.The world’s biggest consumer of energy, China is estimated to have huge shale gas reserves but it is still unclear whether the country will be able to develop them on a commercial scale due to geological and technological challenges.Shale gas is natural gas that is trapped inside shale rock and is extracted by using highly pressurised water mixed with chemicals to crack open the rock.Its increased prominence has revolutionised the energy sector in the US and sent natural gas prices there to the lowest for a decade.Chinese policymakers are seeking to replicate the success of shale gas in the US, and the blueprint released on Friday is the first official detailed statement about policies during the 2011-15 period.It sets a goal of 6.5bn cubic meters of shale gas production by 2015, which is equivalent to 2-3 per cent of projected 2015 Chinese gas production, and more than 60bn cu m of shale gas production by 2020. While those numbers are small compared with the scale of US shale gas production, analysts say the 2020 target will be very difficult to attain given the nascent state of China’s shale gas industry.China does not have any commercial production of shale gas, but exploratory drilling for shale has increased greatly in the past year.The new blueprint emphasises the need for foreign co-operation to develop shale gas technologies, and companies including BP, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell are involved in shale gas exploration joint ventures in China.The five-year plan also states that competition within the shale gas sector will be encouraged and market entry conditions will be clearly defined for companies wishing to work in shale gas; these companies will be also highly encouraged to work with foreign partners.The plan also promised supportive financial policies and subsidies for shale gas, including price subsidies, preferential tax treatment and land subsidies.However, analysts have pointed out that as long as China’s state-controlled prices for natural gas remain at their current levels, companies will not have an incentive to develop shale gas resources because they can make more money from oil.“There is a lot of talk about shale, but not a lot of action by the government in terms of natural gas pricing reform,” said Gordon Kwan, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities, adding that natural gas prices needed to rise in order to make shale profitable.“I think there is too much expectation for shale gas. There is a long-term future for shale gas on China but not right now, right now the focus is still on conventional natural and LNG,” Mr Kwan added.Additional reporting by Gwen Chen"
179;COP;Conocophillips;2012-03-15T23:27:43Z;Shell chooses Pennsylvania for chemical plant;;Royal Dutch Shell plans to site its proposed new multibillion-dollar chemical plant in western Pennsylvania, the company said on Thursday, advancing a project that reflects a resurgence in US industry thanks to rising gas and oil production.Shell has not made a final decision to go ahead with the plant, and needs to assess the financial case for the investment and secure permits. But Dan Carlson of Shell Chemicals described the choice of location as “an important step for the project”.The decision to site the proposed plant near Monaca on the Ohio river, north-west of Pittsburgh, is a coup for Pennsylvania, which beat stiff competition from Ohio and West Virginia to attract the investment.The size of the plant has yet to be confirmed, but it would probably cost several billion dollars. It would employ an estimated 10,000 people while under construction and several hundred when built.Shell said last year it was looking at siting a petrochemicals complex somewhere in the Appalachia region of the north-eastern US to take advantage of the booming production of gas liquids such as ethane.Advances in techniques of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” have unlocked shales holding gas and liquids that could not previously be extracted at commercially viable rates.Shell’s plant would include a “cracker” to convert ethane into ethylene, a standard building block for many plastics.It could have units to make polyethylene, a common plastic, and mono-ethylene glycol, used for antifreeze and resins.Other companies including Dow Chemical and ConocoPhillips are also developing or evaluating new chemical plants in the US.
180;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US natural gas prices slide to 10-year low;;US natural gas prices slid to a fresh 10-year low on Tuesday, exacerbating pressure on drillers in spite of moves to cut production in recent months.Nymex April gas dropped as much as 2.9 per cent to a low of $2.204 per million British thermal units, the weakest since 2002.Prices fell as the final week of an abnormally mild winter included temperatures of more than 20 degrees Celsius in New York. The warm weather has undercut demand for gas as a heating source.The fall took prices below the level that in January prompted producers including Chesapeake Energy and ConocoPhillips to reveal plans to reduce output. Following a brief bounce on the back of those announcements, prices have since resumed their downward trajectory.Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix, a consultancy, noted that “both Europe and the US have warmer than normal temperatures …in the US, the deviations to normal are extreme and will also be a continued pressure point on US natural gas.”The US Department of Energy reported last week that underground stocks of gas slipped modestly to 2.4tn cubic feet, keeping them at a record high for this time of the year.The drop in gas is also pressuring US coal prices, by diverting demand for power generation from coal to gas. US benchmark central Appalachian thermal coal prices fell last week to $58 a tonne, the lowest level in nearly two years.The weakness in natural gas prices is putting pressure on drillers as prices for delivery in several years time, which influence longer-term investment plans, have also tumbled.Natural gas for delivery in December 2017 fell below $5 per mBtu this month for the first time, despite plans being weighed by the US government to liquefy and ship US gas to foreign markets. Producers have announced reductions in output totalling about 1.6bn cu ft per day, according to Barclays Capital. But analysts are uncertain of how much drillers will actually cut.Bentek Energy, a gas researcher, said production in February was about 63.5bn cu ft a day, down only about 500m cu ft a day from previous months. Volumes were still almost 6bn cu ft a day greater than a year ago, Bentek said.One reason why production remains strong is that drilling rigs have been moved from so-called “dry gas” wells to wells that produce oil and natural gas liquids, which are used for petrochemicals. Many of these wells still yield gas as a byproduct, keeping supplies buoyant.
181;COP;Conocophillips;2012-03-11T17:42:46Z;Non-financials dash to the bond markets;;Global non-financial companies have issued a record amount of bonds so far this year as groups including Petrobras, Enel and SABMiller have taken advantage of cheaper borrowing costs and more favourable economic and market conditions.Corporate bond issues have hit $386bn in the year to date, according to Dealogic. That surpasses the amount raised in the same period in 2009 when companies rushed to issue after markets had frozen in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ collapse.This year’s surge in issuance comes as the cost of borrowing for a wide range of companies, from blue-chips to highly leveraged companies has fallen after a broad rally in corporate credit and as cash-rich investors in the US and elsewhere have been buying corporate bonds in an effort to boost their returns after the Federal Reserve pledged to keep interest rates near zero until 2014.Jean-Marc Mercier, global head of debt syndicate at HSBC, said companies, mindful of the fact that banks may not lend to them and seeing that market conditions have improved this year, were choosing to go straight to the bond markets to raise money.“The key is low rates,” said Jim Glascott, head of global debt capital markets at Barclays Capital.This year, average spreads on investment-grade bonds have narrowed to 184 basis points from 234bp at the end of 2011, according to a Barclays index. Average yields this month fell to 3.27 per cent, the lowest level since the index began in 1973. Junk bond yields have dropped to 7.19 per cent from 8.36 per cent at the end of last year.Last week, for instance, Phillips 66, a refining business being spun off by US energy group ConocoPhillips, raised $5.8bn selling bonds.The last few years have demonstrated that the cost of raising money for companies can quickly rise for reasons potentially unrelated to financial health of a specific issuer, like a natural disaster in Japan or a stumble in the eurozone’s efforts to solve its debt crisis. “Treasurers see asymmetric risk to waiting,” said Mr Glascott.Issuance by corporates in Europe, Middle East and Africa – which at $126bn is below the record set in 2009 – is also being aided by more positive market sentiment.Mr Mercier said that the $1tn injection of funds by the European Central Bank into the eurozone banking system had lifted sentiment in Europe. He said news that a majority of private bondholders had accepted the terms of a sovereign debt restructuring with Greece also “removed a big uncertainty that has been hanging over the market for the past 18 months”.
182;COP;Conocophillips;2012-03-09T19:54:51Z;Simplicity – Buffett’s investment watchword;Anyone can emulate Warren, says ex-daughter-in-law;"“Durable competitive advantage”, “predictability of earnings”, and a “motivating” share price are what Warren Buffett looks for in a company – and, according to his ex-daughter-in-law’s latest book, anyone can invest in the same way.Mary Buffett, left, has made a career out of studying the world’s most successful investor, having been married to his son, Peter, for 12 years. This career has seen her writing – in partnership with David Clark – eight books about Warren Buffett and his investment methodology. The latest, The Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio, was published at the end of last year.In an exclusive interview in the FT magazine Investors Chronicle this week, she claims that private investors can easily emulate Buffett Snr’s approach, if they have patience and a sufficiently long time horizon.“He made $60bn by only investing in the stock market,” she explains. “Everyone can with much less capital still get outstanding returns. Anyone can invest like Warren if you stick to the principles and discipline. It’s not rocket science, but not many people do it.”In her new book, she examines 17 equity investments that have helped him to achieve his extraordinary wealth, and reveals the four basic questions that he uses to identify a company with a durable consumer monopoly:17 Warren Buffett investments with a durable competitive advantage●American Express●Bank of New York Mellon●ConocoPhillips●Costco Wholesale Corporation●GlaxoSmithKline●Johnson & Johnson●Kraft Foods●Moody’s Corporation●Procter & Gamble●Sanofi SA●Torchmark Corporation●Union Pacific Corporation●US Bancorp●Walmart●Washington Post Company●Wells Fargo1. Will the product or service the company is selling today be the same product or service that it will be selling ten years from now? Or, as Warren Buffett puts it: “Take Wrigley’s chewing gum. I don’t think the internet is going to change how people chew gum.” Other examples are Coca-Cola and Kraft.2. Can you understand how the product works? Mary says: “Railroads, ie Union Pacific Corporation; and discount shopping, ie Walmart, are not difficult to understand.”3. Does it take large amounts of research and development to keep the service or product competitive?4. Does the company in question have a monopoly or is it the leading low-cost producer of the product or service it sells? “Predictable products equal predictable earnings,” says Mary.She explains that Warren Buffett likes to view stocks like these as fixed-income investments, because their earnings are so predictable. He calls them “equity bonds”. Once a company’s durable competitive advantage and predictability of earning have been established, the “Sage of Omaha” gauges a stock’s value by how attractively it is priced and the consistent long-term profit he believes it will bear.“We are, as value investors, price-motivated. The lower the price the higher the motivation.“It’s like in High School and you like a guy but he is going out with another girl. You wait and then make your move when they break up,” she explains. “This is the key thing that investors don’t do – know what you want to buy and then wait for it to be sold at a discount.”She advises that investors use the tools that are out there on the internet to evaluate companies. “Don’t think of it as stock. Buying a stock is buying a fractional piece of business.”GlaxoSmithKline is the only London-listed stock among the 17 highlighted companies. “It shows great consistency in earnings and rising per share book value,” she says. “Plus, it has really made its mark with Aids antivirals. For Warren and the foundations he has supported it is a natural.”Moira O’Neill is personal finance editor of Investors Chronicle. Read the full interview in this week's issue on sale now"
183;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
184;COP;Conocophillips;2012-03-08T20:00:08Z;Natural gas prices near 10-year low;;Moves by drillers to cut production have failed to stop US natural gas prices from sliding towards a 10-year low.Nymex April gas on Thursday fell as low as $2.241 per million British thermal units, down 2.7 per cent and close to levels that prompted producers including Chesapeake Energy and ConocoPhillips to reveal plans to reduce output.Futures lost ground after the US Department of Energy reported underground stocks slipped modestly last week to 2.4tn cu ft, keeping them at a record high for this time of the year. Relentless growth in supply from US shale fields has weakened prices, putting pressure on drillers. While gas has been relatively cheap compared with coal, making it an attractive alternative as a power plant fuel, an abnormally warm winter has undercut demand.Producers have ann-ounced reductions in output totalling about 1.6bn cu ft per day, according to Barclays Capital. But analysts are uncertain of how much drillers will actually cut. Bentek Energy, a gas researcher, said production in February was about 63.5bn cu ft a day, down only about 500m cu ft a day from previous months. Volumes are still almost 6bn cu ft a day greater than a year ago, Bentek said.One reason why production remains strong is that drilling rigs have been moved from so-called “dry gas” wells to wells that produce oil and natural gas liquids, which are used for petrochemicals. Many of these wells still yield gas as a byproduct, keeping supplies buoyant. “The shut-ins are not working,” said Kent Bayazitoglu, an analyst at Gelber and Associates, an energy consultant in Houston. “They’re more talk than action.”Prices jumped nearly 30 per cent in the week after the drilling companies started announcing cutbacks in late January, but have since resumed their decline, threatening to fall below the 10-year low of $2.231 per mBtu.The US government is weighing proposals to liquefy and ship US gas to foreign markets where prices are higher. Some hedge funds, believing exports may boost domestic prices, have bought futures contracts for delivery years from now, a strategist at a physical gas trading house said. So far, the bet has not paid off, as Nymex December 2015 gas has declined 29 per cent in the past year.
185;COP;Conocophillips;2012-03-07T17:48:08Z;BG Group to sell 20% stake in gas project;;BG Group is to sell up to 20 per cent of a large Australian liquefied natural gas project, according to people familiar with the matter, in a deal that could be worth $2bn.The company is selling a stake in the $15bn Queensland Curtis LNG project, one of BG’s largest investments. The plant, which is scheduled to start exporting gas in 2014, will be the first in the world to produce LNG from coal-bed methane, a type of natural gas found in depleted coal seams.Australia has some of the world’s largest reserves of coal-bed methane, and the industry has attracted sizeable investments by international oil groups such as Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and PetroChina, which were drawn by Australia’s proximity to the fast-growing energy markets of Asia.BG has big oil and gas projects in Brazil and Australia, but analysts say it lacks the financial capacity to develop them all on its own. There have long been expectations that it would sell down its stake in the Queensland development, which at 93.75 per cent is unusually large for a project of this kind.Offering a stake for sale is “an exercise in risk management,” said one person familiar with the matter, since the technology of cooling coal-bed methane for export is still untried. He said the sale was a “very compressed process,” with BG hoping that bidders will make their initial offers before the end of March.BG declined to comment.Chinese national oil companies, state-backed Middle Eastern groups and Japanese trading houses and utilities are likely to feature among the bidders. Japanese demand for LNG as an alternative to nuclear power has grown since last year’s Fukushima nuclear disaster, and Tokyo Gas already has small equity interests in BG’s Australian gas fields and planned LNG processing facilities, as does China’s Cnooc.BG entered Australia in 2008 through an alliance with Queensland Gas Company, which it acquired outright the following year. BG owns interests in concessions there covering about 33,000 square kilometres, and says that only a fraction of the total ground under lease has been explored.The Queensland project envisages natural gas being piped to a planned LNG terminal on Curtis Island, near the city of Gladstone on Australia’s east coast. The first phase will see the construction of two trains or processing units with production capacity of 8.5m tonnes per year. BG is investigating the potential for a third train. The company has already marketed 10m tonnes of LNG from the project, with buyers including Chubu Electric, Tokyo Gas and Cnooc.
186;COP;Conocophillips;2012-02-10T17:44:58Z;Gas price fall forces BG’s hand;;BG Group joined the growing band of energy companies planning to reduce production of shale gas in North America in response to declining wholesale prices this week.A decision by the FTSE 100 oil and gas producer to cut the number of rigs it operates in US shale fields from 35 at the end of 2011 to eight in 2012 follows sharp falls in recent weeks in the prices commanded by gas producers using controversial hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, techniques to release the fuel from rock formations.The rapid expansion of gas derived from fracking in the US is expected to transform the country into a net exporter of gas and also provide a welcome boost to job levels, according to remarks by Barack Obama, US president, in last month’s State of the Union address to Congress.But a glut of shale gas has prompted BG to follow in the footsteps of US groups Chesapeake Energy and ConocoPhillips along with Norway’s Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell in moderating its short-term enthusiasm for shale gas. Each has indicated its intention to scale back drilling and projected production in North America, although some players remain committed to developing oil-rich shale fields in spite of the current glut in US gas production.Last month Chesapeake, the second-largest producer in the US, announced a planned 8 per cent cut in gas production and a two-thirds cut in the number of rigs drilling gas wells, in response to what it described as a gas market that was not “oversupplied”, but “under-demanded”.
187;COP;Conocophillips;2012-02-02T08:36:26Z;Shell outlines aggressive growth strategy;;Royal Dutch Shell has announced plans to shift its focus from North American shale gas to more profitable “tight oil”, as a big drop in US natural gas prices prompts a number of companies to cut gas production.The announcement came as Europe’s largest oil company by market capitalisation reported disappointing results for the fourth quarter, which chief executive Peter Voser blamed on a sharp downturn in industry refining margins and low North American natural gas prices.He also warned that the global economy and energy markets were likely to see “continued high volatility”.Despite the weaker quarter, the Anglo-Dutch group set out an aggressive medium-term growth agenda, with new projects and higher exploration spending expected to boost cash flow over the next three years by 30-50 per cent. Shell also heralded a return to dividend growth this year for the first time since 2009.The company said its fourth-quarter earnings on a current cost of supplies (CCS) basis, a measure that strips out the losses or gains from oil and gas inventory, were $6.45bn, up 13 per cent on the same period the year before. Excluding identified items, CCS earnings rose 18 per cent to $4.85bn, slightly lower than analysts’ forecasts.Despite the weak quarter, Shell said it expected to increase its dividend this year. The company announced a fourth quarter pay-out of $0.42 per ordinary share – unchanged from the same period in 2010 – but said it expected to declare a first-quarter dividend for 2012 of $0.43.Shares in Shell were flat at £22.69 in afternoon trading in London.Analysts were unimpressed. Alastair Syme, oil analyst at Citi, called the dividend increase “somewhat paltry” and said the fact that Shell fell to a loss in refining and marketing “continues to highlight that this business is not as well positioned as peers”.There was also some concern about the $30bn in net capital investment that Shell has targeted for this year, part of plans to boost production by a quarter to 4m barrels a day by 2017.Mr Syme said the continual increase in capital expenditure means that delivery of Shell’s production growth “is coming at [the] expense of returns”.A steep drop in US natural gas prices, caused by the boom in shale gas production combined with weak demand and warm weather, has prompted several companies to announce production cuts in an apparent attempt to stabilise the market, including Chesapeake Energy, one of the largest gas producers in the US, and ConocoPhillips.The slide in prices is prompting many companies to refocus on what Shell calls “liquid-rich shales” – the kind of shales that contain oil instead of, or as well as, gas. Production of tight oil, in places like the Bakken shale in North Dakota, is growing so fast that it has reversed the decades-long decline in US oil output.Simon Henry, Shell’s chief financial officer, said the company had picked up “very significant acreage” in liquid-rich shales, not just in North America, but in Oman, Egypt, Germany, Turkey and Argentina, and intended to spend $1bn in developing it this year.Most of that would be spent in Texas’s Eagle Ford shale, which Shell entered in 2010. Mr Voser said Shell was planning to produce 250,000 barrels a day from its tight oil properties in five years’ time.Shell’s basic CCS earnings per share for the quarter rose 12 per cent compared with a year earlier. Full-year CCS earnings were $28.6bn, up 54 per cent from a year ago, while full-year revenues were $470bn.
188;COP;Conocophillips;2012-02-01T09:41:50Z;Recovering margins to boost oil refiners;The collapse of Petroplus signals reversal for the industry;What a difference a couple of weeks – and the collapse of a company – makes in the oil market.At the beginning of the year, refiners were bracing for losses in every region as their margins – also known as crack spreads – plunged to levels rarely seen over the last decade. In Europe, refining margins fell to $2.5 a barrel in late December and early January, significantly below the five-year average of nearly $11 a barrel.As margins fell, so did the refiner’s demand for crude, a bearish factor for the commodity.The plunge in crack spreads felled Petroplus– Europe’s largest independent refinery – and forced the closure of several key plants in the US, including the Hovensa refinery in the Virgin Islands, which for years was among the largest in the world. But those precise closures, together with a strong fuel oil market and the arrival of a cold snap in Europe, have brought the struggling refiners back to life.As refining capacity disappeared, the traditional simple measure of margins, known as the 3:2:1 crack spread, surged sharply in every region: it is back to nearly $11 a barrel in Europe, above the five-year average. In the US, it is at $26 a barrel, compared with a low point of $11 a barrel in early January and a five-year average of $14.7 a barrel. And in Asia, crack spreads have surged to $19 a barrel, more than double the $7.5 a barrel in early January.The recovery has come at a heavy price for the sector as it is the result of closures that have tightened refined oil products supply in Europe and the US and, hence, crack spreads. Over the past four weeks, more than 1m barrels a day of refining capacity has shut down in the Atlantic basin, including the Hovensa plant, and the refineries run by Petroplus. Besides, in late 2011, several European refiners run by LyondellBasell and plants owned by ConocoPhillips and Sunoco in the US state of Pennsylvania also closed.Soozhana Choi, oil analyst at Deutsche Bank in Singapore, reckons that about 1.2m b/d have closed since the beginning of the year, “which would narrow the global refinery surplus and imply a healthier 2012 margin environment”.Ms Choi estimates that the refinery surplus in 2012 of 3.4 per cent of global oil demand would now narrow to a much healthier 3 per cent. If all the five plants of Petroplus are closed, the surplus could fall to 2.7 per cent, “closer to the average surplus during the strong-margin environment between 2004-2008”.The closure of refineries is not the only reason for the strong crack spreads. The surge in fuel oil prices to near record levels is also helping. Fuel oil has been a lossmaking refined product for years, if not decades. But in January refiners made money out of fuel oil. In Singapore, they made about 16 cents a barrel refining it. Yes, the number looks awfully low. But it compares with losses of between $5 and $15 a barrel in the same month between 2008 and 2011, according to JBC Energy, a Vienna-based oil consultancy.The sharp recovery in crack spreads is a short-term bullish factor for crude oil prices as refiners are now demanding more crude to take advantage of the stronger crack spreads.Will it last? The market’s view is split.Without stronger final demand, the rush to process crude could result in a pick-up in refined products inventories. Moreover, stronger crack spreads could keep afloat moribund refiners, preventing, or at least delaying, the necessary consolidation of the sector, particularly in Europe and the US.The Financial Times is hosting its first Global Commodities Summit on April 24-25 in Lausanne, Switzerland.

189;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-31T20:11:11Z;ExxonMobil earnings hit by refining decline;;ExxonMobil, the world’s largest listed oil and gas group by market capitalisation, has reported a rise in earnings of just 2 per cent and a drop in production for the fourth quarter of last year, in a sign of how difficult it is for international oil companies to deliver growth.Exxon’s profits were lifted by a 27 per cent rise in the price of its oil to an average of about $103 a barrel but hit by lower production and a decline in profits from its refineries and chemicals businesses.Fourth-quarter production fell 9 per cent to 4.53m barrels of oil equivalent a day, struck by factors including quota limits imposed by Opec, the oil producers’ cartel and contract terms that give Exxon’s partners more oil when prices are higher.Even excluding those factors, and the effect of disposals, production still fell 4 per cent, reflecting weak gas demand in Europe, and normal decline as fields age.Exxon’s falling output came as the company increased capital spending from $26.1bn in 2008 to $36.8bn last year, and also closed the $41bn acquisition of XTO in June of 2010.The other leading US oil companies have also had falling production. Chevron, the second-largest US oil and gas group, also reported a 5 per cent drop for the fourth quarter, while ConocoPhillips, the third largest, was down 8 per cent.Western oil companies are constrained by declining production in some of the traditional heartlands, such as the North Sea, and find it difficult to expand in many resource-rich countries for political or security reasons.Exxon’s operations in Iraq, for example, have been at the centre of controversy after the company signed a deal to explore in the semi-autonomous northern region of Kurdistan – a move that sparked anger in Baghdad.Although US oil and gas production has started to rise because of improvements in the technologies of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing that have opened previously uncommercial reserves, those techniques have been pioneered by smaller independent companies rather than the large groups.Exxon’s post-tax earnings were up 2 per cent at $9.4bn for the quarter, although due to the company’s share buy-back programme, earnings a share rose 6 per cent to $1.97, roughly in line with analysts’ expectations.In the upstream oil and gas production business, fourth-quarter profits fell 10 per cent in the US, to $1.18bn, because of lower natural gas prices, but rose 24 per cent internationally to $7.65bn due to the higher price of oil. Upstream profits were also helped by $810m of gains, primarily from asset sales.Exxon said it did not plan to follow the example of some other companies, including ConocoPhillips, in shutting in some of its US gas production, but was diverting drilling rigs away from gas and towards oil wells.In the downstream refining and marketing, however, US profits slid from $226m to just $30m, and outside the US by 57 per cent from $924m to $395m.Other companies, including Chevron, have also reported steep falls in profit or even losses in their refining businesses, hit by weak fuel demand in many markets.In Exxon’s chemicals business inside and outside the US, profits also fell sharply, dropping 49 per cent to $543m.The shares fell after the results were announced, and were down 2 per cent to $83.86 in early afternoon trading.In a statement, Rex Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive, said: “ExxonMobil recorded strong results while investing at record levels to develop new supplies of energy that are critical to meeting growing world demand.”

191;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-26T11:00:54Z;Obama seeks to lift natural gas demand;;Plans to increase US demand for natural gas, including a new tax break for gas-fuelled trucks, are being unveiled by President Barack Obama on Thursday as part of the effort set out in his state of the union address to support “American-made energy”.The proposals, some of which will require legislation from a Congress that has been reluctant to endorse any of president Obama’s initiatives, include a new lease sale of offshore drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico, the second since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.The plans to strengthen gas demand follow a slump in the US gas price to a ten-year low last week. This was caused by the boom in reserves that were previously thought to be uneconomic, weak demand because of warmer weather than expected and the slow growth of the economy.Gas producing companies such as Chesapeake Energy and ConocoPhillips have been announcing plans to cut back their North American gas output.They are also hoping, however, that increased demand will help lift prices from their present levels of about $2.75 per million British thermal units.President Obama’s proposed tax break for trucks powered by gas or other alternative fuels would be worth half the difference in price between one of those trucks and a conventional diesel-powered vehicle.Among other proposals, he also wants a competitive grant programme to give funds to communities that come up with ways to break down the barriers to greater use of natural gas, support for investment in infrastructure such as filling stations and help for municipalities to switch to gas for their buses and trucks.With US crude oil at about $100 a barrel, gas is a much cheaper alternative.However, the growth of vehicles using natural gas as fuel has been restricted by the lack of infrastructure such as filling stations to give drivers the confidence that they will be able to refuel when they need to.President Obama will be making his speech at a UPS depot in Las Vegas, which has trucks powered by liquefied natural gas (super cooled to minus 162 degrees centigrade) in its fleet.UPS had been reluctant to deploy LNG-powered trucks in that area, the administration says, because of the lack of infrastructure, but the company was able to switch to gas after a filling station was opened in the city, thanks in part to help from the president’s 2009 stimulus package.Mr Obama has been stressing the value of US gas production in terms of job creation and the environmental benefits of burning gas rather than coal to generate power.The substitution of gas for oil in transport could help US energy security, given that oil imports are still running at almost 9m barrels a day.

193;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-25T22:26:43Z;Conoco to cut North American gas output;;"ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group by market capitalisation, has said it plans to cut its North American gas production this year as it shifts to more profitable oil reserves, becoming the latest group to announce output reductions after gas prices fell to a 10-year low.The company suggested that a high single-digit decline in its US gas production was possible, following a 9 per cent drop last year. It made the prediction as it reported a 38 per cent rise in underlying earnings for the final quarter of 2011, thanks to the rise in oil prices.The boom in shale gas production and weak demand caused by the sluggish economy and warm weather have sent US gas prices plunging. On Monday, one of the largest gas producers in the US, Chesapeake Energy announced a planned production cut of 8 per cent, which was interpreted by analysts as an attempt to stabilise the market.Like Chesapeake, Conoco said it was diverting drilling rigs away from gas and towards oil reserves such as the Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin, both in Texas. Of the 35-40 rigs that Conoco had running in the “lower 48” states, it said, fewer than five were drilling for gas, and production was likely to continue to decline.The plan is to shut about 4 per cent of its North American gas production, but the company added that there were limits to how far its gas output could fall. About two-thirds of its gas comes as a byproduct from wells for oil or natural gas liquids, which earn much higher returns and so are worth keeping open.Of the remainder, Jeff Sheets, Conoco’s chief financial officer, added: “We have partners on a lot of that production as well, and partners have different views about shut-ins, with most of our partners not wanting to shut in and lose the cash flow.”Two other US companies also said on Tuesday that their gas production would be difficult to cut. Steve Chazen, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil US oil group by market capitalisation, told analysts that the current price of gas at about $2.50-$2.60 per million British thermal units was “not sustainable”.However, he added “[the] bulk of our gas is associated gas and comes off with the oil. Not much I can do about cutting that back.”Similarly, Continental Resources, which has delivered spectacular growth in its oil production in the Bakken shale of North Dakota, said this year it expected 28 per cent growth in its “dry” gas output – which accounts for only about 10-15 per cent of its total production – because it will come from wells drilled for oil and other higher-value liquids.In its fourth-quarter results statement, Conoco said it was on track to spin off its downstream refining and marketing operations into a new company, Phillips 66, as planned, in the second quarter of this year, possibly in May.Conoco is splitting to allow the two sides of the group to focus on their own businesses, and plans to sell $5bn-$10bn worth of assets this year. It also has a $10bn share buy-back programme.Its oil and gas production fell 8 per cent to 1.6m barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, hit by the Libyan civil war and disruption in China following an offshore oil spill from a platform it part-owns.However, a rise in the average price of Conoco’s oil sales from $78.76 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $109.31 in the equivalent period of 2011 lifted underlying earnings in its exploration and production division 27 per cent to $2.35bn.In refining and marketing, profits fell 3 per cent to $201m; a better performance than for some of Conoco’s rivals. Chevron, the second-largest US oil group, has warned that its fourth-quarter earnings, released on Friday, will show its refining business was “near break-even” in the period. Tesoro, one of the largest US refiners, has warned of a possible fourth quarter loss.Conoco confirmed the planned ramp-up in its capital spending on exploration and production, from $9.3bn in 2010 to $12.7bn in 2011 and an expected $14bn this year, Capital spending in refining and marketing was just $994m last year, down from $1.26bn in 2010.The impending break-up of the company continues a drive to increase shareholder value that began in 2010, when Conoco launched a programme of asset sales and share buy-backs. Since then, it has raised $10.7bn from disposals, including $9.5bn from the 20 per cent stake in Lukoil of Russia, and bought back shares worth $15bn.The benefit of that showed in an effective rise in underlying earnings per share of 53 per cent."
194;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-25T19:14:37Z;Weir widens reach amid boom in fracking;;Weir Group has extended its exposure to the North American market for shale gas and oil yet again through the purchase of Novatech, a Texas-based manufacturer of pump parts.The deal comes as Weir, which holds a 50 per cent market share in the supply of high-pressure pumps used in the North American shale market, seeks to extend its own manufacturing capability in Fort Worth, Texas, and Edmonton, Canada, to deal with a backlog in orders from rig operators of up to six months.Weir is to pay $176m for the family-owned Dallas-based business, and comes two months after the FTSE 100 company deepened its involvement in “ fracking”, or hydraulic fracturing, of shale formations to extract oil and gas by paying $675m for Texas-based wellhead specialist Seaboard Holdings.That deal effectively doubled Weir’s share of the global fracking surface equipment market dominated by North American companies towards 10 per cent. Rivals Cameron and FMC Tech each command a quarter of the $4.5bn market, while GE has a 13 per cent share, according to recent data produced by Spears.The Seaboard deal was similar in scale to its $653m acquisition of SPM Flow Control in 2007, which originally established Weir as a large supplier to upstream oil companies in North America looking to exploit the nascent fracking boom. The process demands high pressure pumping systems and highly abrasive horizontal drilling techniques to extract oil and gas from rock formations.Though small in scale, the Novatech acquisition reflects Weir’s determination to widen its marketing reach and ease supply bottlenecks in order to compete more effectively against rivals struggling to keep pace with demand for new and replacement fracking equipment.Speaking to the Financial Times at the end of last year, Keith Cochrane, Weir’s chief executive, argued the increasing number of fracking projects targeting oil shale deposits could continue to drive demand. “Rig count has continued to grow despite the gas market being flat all year,” he said. “There are 3,500 wells that are drilled but not fracked – we have that degree of backlog.”While major oil service companies such as Halliburton prefer to make their own pumps and operate a vertically integrated business model, Weir is keen to target its growing portfolio of pumps and valves directly to rig operators and oil services customers such as Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, which are more likely to outsource supplies.However, as the sector continues to expand, clouds are appearing on the horizon.Earlier this week one Weir customer, Chesapeake Energy, said it was planning an 8 per cent cut in gas production and a 67 per cent cut in the number of rigs drilling gas wells. While on Wednesday, ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group by market capitalisation, said it also planned to cut its North American gas production this year as it shifts to more profitable oil reserves. The moves are in response to US natural gas prices hitting a decade low.Mr Cochrane conceded that “at some point original equipment will get into balance or come off a bit as the market gets into equilibrium, as demand and supply reach a balance”.However, Weir is already preparing for when fracking capacity hits a new plateau. Mr Cochrane said the rapid expansion of demand for equipment, which is subject to extremes of pressure and abrasion, has created a lucrative aftermarket for spares, which Weir can exploit.“Installed horsepower [rig output] may be peaking – but as expansion falls, replacement continues to rise,” he said.Andrew Carter, London-based analyst at RBC, said that capacity additions being undertaken by Weir and some of its competitors “are about right”, and could bring supply and demand close to balance by the end of 2012.Mr Carter also calculated that capacity expansion at Weir plants in Texas and Canada announced last year could add up to $400m to revenue capacity.Remarks from Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake’s chief executive, that US natural gas was not “oversupplied” but “under-demanded” find an echo in Mr Cochrane’s view that the fundamental imperative of energy security will underpin markets for both shale gas and oilfields being developed in North America.“A number of people are looking at petrochemical plant extensions in the US,” he said, while the “dash to gas” in North America could provide a cleaner fuel source for the US’s ageing portfolio of power plants.Mr Cochrane also argued that beyond the US, moves to exploit shale reserves in Europe, Asia and Latin America could be exploited by a company that has a worldwide manufacturing footprint.That point was backed on Wednesday by Mr Carter, who pointed to recent observations by Schlumberger that unconventional drilling activity is picking up more quickly than it had expected, particularly in Argentina, China and Poland, but also the Middle East.……………………………………………………………..Obama backs development of natural gasIf fears over the impact of softening gas prices on suppliers of fracking equipment has weighed on Weir Group’s share price this month, remarks from President Obama in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night proved particularly welcome.In spite of environmental controversy surrounding the rapid expansion of hydraulic fracking, the president appeared to champion it as a key plank of US energy policy capable of creating 600,000 new jobs in a period of high unemployment.“We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years, and my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy,” he said.Weir, the FTSE 100’s top gainer in 2010, strongly outperformed the blue-chip index last year in large part because of its exposure to fracking, but the stock has slipped from £21.58 to a low of £18.66 on Monday on signs of an end to the fracking boom and collapse in US gas prices.But Andrew Carter of RBC backed Weir’s US latest acquisition: “If management were as concerned by US natural gas prices as some market participants are, we do not think this deal would have happened.”Malcolm Graham-Wood, oil industry analyst at VSA Capital, agreed. “After the last few days when investors have been worried about the company’s exposure to the shale gas industry, this acquisition shows that the company are happy with the sector,” he said.
195;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-23T20:40:33Z;The LNG and the short of it;The outlook for liquefied natural gas is still strong but a lot of optimism has already been factored in;"When politicians describe projects requiring billions of development dollars as a “golden age”, investors should be wary, even when it is about something as strong as the market for liquefied natural gas. This week Sinopecfinalised a $1.1bn deal to increase supply and raise its equity in one Australian LNG project. Earlier this month, Japan’s Inpex and France’s Total finalised agreement on Ichthys, their own A$33bn plant in Darwin.For Martin Ferguson, Australia’s resources minister, things do look golden; some A$200bn is being invested by ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron, among many others, which should boost the country’s LNG production nearly sixfold to 120m tons per annum, surpassing Qatar. Global demand for LNG will rise by 70 per cent by 2020, estimates Sanford Bernstein. Australia’s own producers are also involved; Origin Energy is an equal partner with ConocoPhillips in Australia-Pacific LNG, the deal in which Sinopec now holds a quarter. Woodside Petroleum’s Pluto should begin production this year.But the projects’ costs are also rising. According to Fitch Ratings, Ichthys will cost A$4,000 per ton of LNG produced. That is up nearly 70 per cent from its owners’ initial 2008 estimates. Australia-Pacific LNG will cost about A$3,000. Historically, this is high. Stretched labour markets, resulting cost-overruns and the risk of tighter environmental or safety regulation could push this higher still. Then there is the oil price. Its strength (Asian LNG is priced off crude) has encouraged the projects, but now success in turn depends on oil holding at or above these levels.Woodside underperformed the ASX 200 by 11 percentage points in the past year. Cost overruns of nearly a quarter on Pluto, and a year’s delay in first delivery were a factor. Origin underperformed the index by 5 percentage points.The outlook for LNG is still strong, and the oil price may remain high. But a lot of optimism has already been factored in. Golden ages should only be labelled in hindsight, and not by politicians.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
196;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-23T17:11:46Z;Statoil buys in to Cairn’s Greenland stake;;Cairn Energy, the FTSE 100 oil explorer, has sold down part of its exploration interests in Greenland’s Arctic waters to Statoil of Norway following its own failure to make a commercial oil strike during a $1.2bn drilling campaign off the island, which it opted to pursue without risk-sharing partners.The deal could be one of several struck by Cairn in the coming months as it seeks to mitigate the risks involved in its attempts to establish Greenland as a major oil resource.Shares in the company, which peaked at more than 473p early last year, have fallen with each disappointing announcement about the Greenland campaign. On Monday, they stood at 295½p.Neither Statoil nor Cairn would reveal the implied value placed on the acquired stake in the Greenland block. The deal comes a week ahead of a vote by Cairn investors to approve the return of $3.5bn of funds to shareholders following the sale of a stake in Indian oilfields to Vedanta, the mining and metals group.Simon Thomson, Cairn’s chief executive, said the experience of state-controlled Statoil in operating and developing Arctic assets made it the “partner of choice” in the farm-out of a 31 per cent interest in the Pitu block in waters in the north of Baffin Bay.Statoil will pay an unspecified signature bonus to Cairn along with costs towards the block’s development to date, as well as agreed terms for contributing towards future exploration expenditure.Pitu is one of 11 exploration blocks held by Cairn and is adjacent to two Shell-operated blocks in which Statoil already has minority stakes. Cairn will maintain a 57 per cent stake in the Pitu field, with the remaining 12.5 per cent interest held by Nunaoil, Greenland’s national oil company.Statoil has recently signalled its own determination to push ahead with further exploration of the Barents Sea in Arctic waters, to the north of established fields in Norway’s own section of Europe’s continental shelf.The announcement of the farm-out in Greenland comes a week ahead of an extraordinary meeting to approve a 160p-a-share cash return to investors. But Cairn also faces a shareholder revolt over a vote to approve the granting of a £2.5m bonus in share options, along with a further £1m contribution to charity, to Sir Bill Gammell, its chairman.Shares in Cairn closed up 1.8p at 292.4p.…● FT CommentInvestors looking beyond Cairn’s planned $3.5bn cash return and untroubled by quibbles over Sir Bill’s bonuses should welcome the first of several planned farm-outs of stakes in its Greenland blocks. Obscurity over the terms of the deal gives little clue to the total valuation of Cairn’s Arctic assets, though analysts speculated that Cairn might net $100m or more from Statoil’s farm-in from one block alone. But looked at from the top down, Cairn’s return of cash will reduce its market capitalisation from £4.15bn to about £1.9bn. That will leave its shares set to trade at a discount to its remaining cashpile of more than $1bn and a residual stake in Cairn India valued at $2.5bn. That implies Cairn’s remaining exploration assets focused on Greenland, but also including Spain, Albania and Nepal, are being thrown in for free. After the pain of $1.2bn spent in Greenland without reward so far, Monday’s deal points to some valuable upside in the emerging rump company.
197;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-23T09:00:47Z;Celebrating New Year with a $1.1bn deal;;"Not quite everything in Chinese business has come to a halt for the New Year holiday. It was announced on the Australian Stock Exchange on Monday that state-controlled Sinopec is to spend $1.1 bn increasing its stake in Australia-Pacific LNG, an Australian development led by ConocoPhillips of the US and and Australia’s Origin Energy.The price, published in an Origin statement, seals an agreement disclosed last month under which Sinopec Group is raising its share of the venture from 15 per cent to 25 per cent and boosting its promised annual LNG purchases by 3.3m tonnes to 7.6m tonnes for 20 years.The agreement, which revises a deal originally struck last April, will see ConocoPhillips (COP:NYQ) and Origin Energy (ORG:ASX) reducing their stakes to 37.5 per cent each.The development furthers China’s plans to more than double natural gas consumption to cut its dependence on coal and oil. Sinopec is already Australia’s largest buyer of LNG – and its share is likely to grow further as new investments come to fruition.Australia-Pacific LNG is a key $20bn project, with its first train planned to come on stream in 2015. Origin said on Monday that the second train (expected to start production in 2016) was expected to be agreed in “early 2012″.According to Origin’s statement, Fu Chengyu, Sinopec chairman, said: “The Sale and Purchase Agreement with Australia Pacific LNG is an important part of Sinopec’s energy portfolio, and will help us to ensure long term gas supply for the growing demand in the Chinese market.”Jim Mulva, chairman of ConocoPhillips, was quoted as saying: “Today is another important milestone for the Australia Pacific LNG project. Reinforcing the strong group of companies overseeing the Australia Pacific LNG project, we are pleased that Sinopec will have an increased shareholding of 25 per cent.”Kevin McCann, Origin Energy chairman, said: “The extension of the existing LNG sales
agreement between Australia Pacific LNG and Sinopec represents the largest LNG supply
agreement in Australian history and is testament to the scale and quality of the project. With the marketing of the second train now complete, Australia Pacific LNG is on track to make a final investment decision on the second train in early 2012.”With the three chairmen having signed off on the deal, it really is time to enjoy the seasonal festivities.Related reading:

198;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-22T19:04:27Z;Monti aims to restore Libya relations;;Silvio Berlusconi courted Libya and Muammer Gaddafi by returning a stolen headless statue of Venus four year ago. Not to be outdone, Mario Monti has followed in his predecessor’s footsteps by returning the marble head of a Roman emperor’s daughter.Relations between Libya and Italy, its most important commercial partner, seem to have been restored by the new Italian prime minister’s weekend visit to Tripoli. Each side is anxious to move on from the close personal ties developed by Italy’s former leader and the former dictator overthrown and killed last October.However, it remained unclear what would happen to the “friendship treaty”, signed by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Gaddafi in 2008, by which Italy pledged to pay $5bn during 25 years in reparations for colonial-era atrocities.“We left it to one side,” Abdel Rahim al-Kib, Libya’s prime minister, said on Saturday after signing a declaration with Mr Monti, who emphasised the importance Italy attaches to north Africa by making Libya his first foreign visit outside Europe since he took office in November.An important bellwether in the relationship is Eni, Italy’s state-controlled oil and gas company which is the largest producer in Libya and Africa as a whole.“We have been in Africa for 60 years – and in dozens of revolutions we never had changes in our oil contracts,” Paolo Scaroni, chief executive of Eni, told the Financial Times on his return from Tripoli.Eni’s combined oil and gas output in Libya is almost back to pre-war levels of 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, after faster-than-expected recoveries by damaged installations, and relations with Libya’s National Oil Company are good. Libyan gas supply to Italy by means of the Greenstream pipeline across the Mediterranean resumed late last year.But Mr Scaroni recognised that Eni’s efforts to remain dominant in Libya were being challenged by a series of competitors gearing up for new licensing rounds that are expected once Libya forms a fresh government at elections in June for a national assembly that has the task of drafting a new constitution.“Everybody is here – the whole list of the world’s oil companies,” Mr Scaroni said, listing “minor” rivals from Russia and China as well as European oil majors who were already present in Libya, as well as late arrivals from the US. France’s Total and Spain’s Repsol YPF are Eni’s closest competitors in terms of current output, while BP of the UK has not yet started the offshore exploration that was interrupted by fallout from its oil-well disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and then Libya’s civil war last year.Eni and the Libyan government are still at work on an agreement that would see Eni spend $380m on social development projects expected to focus on postwar reconstruction. Mr Scaroni expects Tripoli during the next few weeks to finalise its priorities, emphasising that Eni will deliver projects, not cash.The sum of $380m for social and infrastructure projects represents the total of two agreements signed by Eni with Mr Gaddafi’s former regime in 2006 and 2010 that were not implemented, according to Mr Scaroni.Other international oil companies with large operations in Libya are, however, far from reaching their pre-war production levels. Repsol YPF forecast output of about 170,000 barrels a day this quarter from fields that it operates, compared with a pre-war level of 340,000 b/d. Total of France and OMV of Austria are pumping about 60 per cent of their pre-war level.Oil production levels are even lower for US-companies such as ConocoPhillips, Hess and Marathon, which only resumed operations in Libya this month after lengthy repairs to the El Sider oil export terminal.The International Energy Agency, the western countries’ oil watchdog, said Libya pumped 800,000 b/d last month, fewer than the 1m b/d claimed by Libyan authorities, and half the 1.6m b/d level before the war began last February.Additional reporting by Javier Blas in London
199;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-18T18:54:17Z;Oil demand falls for first time since 2009;;Oil demand has fallen for the first time since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, a result of the weakening economy, a mild winter and high crude prices, according to new estimates from the International Energy Agency.The industrialised nations’ watchdog said oil demand dropped by 300,000 barrels a day year-on-year in the final quarter of 2011. While still forecasting overall growth in demand for 2012, the agency revised down its outlook for this year to growth of 1.1m barrels a day, from 1.3m b/d, and said further downgrades were possible. Global oil demand in 2011 was 89.5m b/d.David Fyfe, head of the IEA’s oil industry and markets division, said the drop in demand late last year reflected the mild winter, which was in sharp contrast to the cold winter of 2010-11. But it was still surprising. “It is quite rare” to see an absolute contraction, he said. “We’re flagging that there are clearly downside risks to the global economy and to oil demand.”The price of crude has been relatively stable since last spring, within a range of $100 to $120 a barrel. But it jumped $4-$5 a barrel at the new year as the European Union prepared to impose a ban on Iranian oil imports and Tehran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial conduit for oil exports from the Gulf.The IEA characterised the oil market as finely balanced between fears of supply disruptions due to tensions over Iran and concerns about an economic slowdown that will weaken demand for oil, reflected in a series of recent refinery shutdowns. Markets were, it said, caught between a “rock” – the growing likelihood of a downturn, or even outright recession, in 2012 – and a “hard place” – possible geopolitical turmoil triggered by the west’s face-off with Iran.Brent crude was trading at $110.68 a barrel in afternoon trading, down 85 cents.The agency said demand declined year-on-year in only nine quarters in the last decade – five of them during the 2008-09 financial crisis, and two in the recession of 2000-01. Mr Fyfe said the world could see zero oil demand growth this year if there were further downgrades to global gross domestic product growth estimates.But some analysts said there was no evidence to suggest a sustained decline in demand. “There’s nothing in anyone’s outlook that suggests demand will follow a similar pattern to 2008-09,” said Paul Horsnell, an oil analyst at Barclays Capital, “especially if GDP growth this year comes in at around 3.2 per cent.”Iranian naval assets in the region along with international maritime boundaries, shipping lanes, terminals, pipelines and major oil and gas fieldsOil markets in Europe and Asia, hit badly last year by the loss of Libyan supply, worry that sanctions against Iran will seriously affect the availability of crude. Refiners in Europe, which imports about 600,000 b/d of Iranian crude, are already chasing replacement supplies – a task the IEA acknowledged would be “difficult.”But in the latest symptom of weak demand, a US Virgin Islands refinery jointly owned by New York-listed Hess and Petróleos de Venezuela, the state oil company, will shut down by mid-February.The refinery’s losses of $1.3bn in the past three years were “caused primarily by weakness in demand for refined petroleum products due to the global economic slowdown and the addition of new refining capacity in emerging markets,” the joint venture said Wednesday.The closure of the Virgin Islands refinery – a major supplier of fuels to the US – follows recent shutdowns of European refineries run by Petroplus and LyondellBasell and refineries in the US state of Pennsylvania owned by ConocoPhillips and Sunoco.The Virgin Islands refinery, Hovensa, last year reduced capacity to 350,000 b/d from 500,000 b/d.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
200;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-18T12:38:54Z;The dealmaker: Year ahead in M&A;Happy new year! Or perhaps not so happy for the world’s dealmakers, who are experiencing the most subdued start to January for some eight years;Happy new year! Or perhaps not so happy for the world’s dealmakers, who are experiencing the most subdued start to January for some eight years.True, it is very early days in 2012, but bankers hoping that the festive champagne would wash away corporate worries about the eurozone crisis and the economic recovery have been disappointed.Instead, this year has started much as the last one finished: quiet, uncertain and with the fundamentals of a mergers and acquisitions recovery in place but with little to show for it.Bankers are still betting that strong balance sheets and the need to find growth will prompt companies, particularly in the US, to act quickly when the European debt crisis is closer to being resolved and the pall of uncertainty lifts.What else might 2012 bring in the world of M&A?First, corporate break-ups will continue as a theme. Last year saw a rash of companies choosing to sell off or spin out disparate divisions in a bid for corporate clarity and renewed focus. That trend is set to continue or become even more pronounced. The urge to demerge has so far been led by the oil and gas industry, with companies such as ConocoPhillips, Marathon and others choosing to separate their upstream and midstream operations in a fundamental shift of business model. Now, advisers say, companies in every industry, from healthcare to media as well as the obvious diversified industrial candidates, are considering whether a break up makes sense for them.Second, the activists will be busy. The fad for corporate break-ups has been manna from heaven for shareholder agitators looking to take advantage of beaten-down valuations. Pushing for additional leverage, or even a sale, is out of favour. But activists will continue to urge companies to re-examine their portfolio mix, while lobbying for corporate governance improvements is also on the rise. However, fewer activist campaigns are resulting in full-blown proxy fights, which aim to replace the board of the target company. Moreover, experts argue, investors are considering activist proposals with a more sceptical eye – Carl Icahn was among those who failed to garner investor support for his campaigns at Forest Laboratories, Clorox and Commercial Metals.Third, those eyeing deals will become more aggressive. In the dealmaking hush around the turn of the year, it was notable that two hostile situations became public. Martin Marietta made a $4.7bn unsolicited offer for construction aggregates rival Vulcan Materials and last week Westlake Chemical unveiled its $1.1bn bid for peer Georgia Gulf. These are not the mega-deals for which advisers yearn. But they do suggest, argue bankers, that as markets recover there will be more would-be buyers than willing sellers. And those who see M&A as strategically crucial, particularly to shore up businesses against a long, slow economic slog, may not be prepared to wait. Analysis by Citigroup’s financial strategy group found that companies that bought in periods of high market volatilty saw their stock outperform by 18 per cent, more than buyers in calmer markets. Impatience, then, can be rewarded.Fourth, antitrust will loom larger in would-be buyers’ thinking. Last year was as notable for the deals that did not happen as for those that crossed the finishing line. Nasdaq OMX’s audacious break-up bid for NYSE Euronext was nixed by the US Department of Justice, who later saw off the year’s biggest deal, stymying AT&T’s $39bn tie-up with T-Mobile USA. As the new year gets underway, the NYSE’s deal with Deutsche Borse looks in peril thanks to European regulators and Express Scripts $29bn purchase of Medco has yet to win the blessing of US watchdogs. One consequence of this could be bigger and more creative reverse break fees designed to protect a seller from the risk that regulators block their deal.Finally, mining and natural resources will continue to dominate. The scramble for natural resources made energy, mining and utilities the most active sector last year, according to Mergermarket, with more than a quarter of total deal volume. Expect that to continue, with oil & gas departments of the investment banks among the few to be working around the clock in the early days of 2012. A survey of 100 chief financial officers of US oil and gas companies by BDO, the accounting and consulting firm, found that more than half predicted a rise in M&A, driven by interest in unconventional energy sources such as shale gas. Meanwhile, miners’ stock prices, particularly for those focused metals such as gold, have disconnected from rising underlying commodity prices. That has created an opportunity to buy just as large producers struggle to fill their pipelines with their own exploration activity.
201;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-12T19:42:16Z;Chevron: clear appeal;The bulk of earnings may come from upstream operations;It has been good to be Chevron over the past couple of years – even compared with other integrated oil and gas behemoths – but some reversion to the mean is inevitable. Yesterday’s profit warning, coming two weeks ahead of fourth-quarter results, would have sent the shares down more sharply if refining competitors Tesoro and Marathon Petroleum had not pre-empted it this week.Aside from various non-recurring items, refining was where most of the weakness lay. A benchmark price for gulf coast refining margins, reflecting a standard slate of products for Mexican crude, fell by over half versus the fourth quarter on lower volumes and softer fuel prices. West coast and international refinery volumes also dropped, reflecting facility sales and closures and weak demand. Nearly all of Chevron’s earnings may come from upstream operations in the fourth quarter, and this is where it shines relative to competitors. Chevron was the best-performing large integrated producer globally in 2011. Being more “oily” than “gassy” helps as North American gas prices remain depressed by the shale boom and unusually mild winter.On a calorific basis, WTI crude is near a record 6½ times the price of natural gas. Chevron’s US natural gas production is less than a third of its US hydrocarbon output and less than 11 per cent of Chevron’s total on an oil-equivalent basis. Competitors ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, by contrast, have made mammoth bets on US gas in recent years. Even with declining production through 2013, Chevron’s modest valuation and its leverage to oil prices are attractive. Analysts at Barclays Capital see 57 per cent upside and 18 per cent downside at a long-term Brent price of $120 and $70, respectively (it is now above $113). For those seeking big oil in “Big Oil”, Chevron’s appeal is clear.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
202;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Refinery closures raise fears on oil prices;;"Growing tension with Iran and a threat to global crude supplies may be dominating oil traders’ attention but a potentially bigger story is breaking on the demand side of the market.Petroplus, Europe’s largest independent refining company, this week began shutting down three of its five refineries, halting about a quarter of a million barrels of daily production.The move by the refiner follows plans by other operators to mothball half the refining capacity on the US Atlantic coast. Since the 2008-09 financial crisis, 2.6m barrels a day of capacity has disappeared from advanced economies, according to the International Energy Agency. More closures are coming.These decisions will have a lasting impact on petroleum markets, say analysts. Refineries are the main customers for the world’s oil producers. Shutting down one plant reduces demand for the types of crude oil it uses if other refineries do not fill the gap.In the case of Petroplus, half the oil its refineries process is similar to the high-quality, low-sulphur Brent crude traded on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research. Spot markets for the benchmark North Sea grade, trading at more than $113 a barrel, could weaken as a result.Cheaper crude prices do not necessarily mean cheaper fuel for drivers, airlines and trucking companies. Fewer refineries hand those that are left greater influence over prices on the forecourt. After Swiss-based Petroplus warned it faced a credit freeze last week indicative refining margins jumped in north-west Europe, according to data from the IEA and Purvin & Gertz, the consultants.“When refineries close you have: number one, less demand for crude oil; and two, less supply of products,” says Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at BofA Merrill Lynch. The bank expects refiners to cut 1m b/d of capacity this year.Just over a decade ago, George W. Bush, then US president, declared: “What this nation needs to do is to build more refining capacity.” Then, in 2001, US refineries ran at 93 per cent of capacity. Now they are running at 86 per cent. The amount of idle crude oil distillation capacity has more than trebled to almost 1m b/d, US Energy Information Administration statistics show.There are several reasons for this. The US refining industry responded to Mr Bush’s call. The ethanol industry took off, supplementing petrol supplies with fuel from corn. Strict new standards for sulphur and other pollutants were expensive for older refineries to meet.Oil prices later rose and the financial crisis struck in 2008, sapping petrol demand. Europe’s debt crisis has not only slowed its economy but crimped access to loans for refiners such as Petroplus, which on Thursday announced its access to revolving credit had been suspended. Since mid-2008, nine refineries have closed in Europe, the IEA says.“We still see more closures to come in Europe,” says Toril Bosoni, IEA refining analyst.On the US east coast, Sunoco is selling refineries at Marcus Hook and Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania. It idled Marcus Hook last month. ConocoPhillips idled and put a nearby refinery on the auction block in September. Together these three units comprise more than half the refining capacity for a region that includes Boston, New York and Washington.The closures come as global oil demand is set to break records this year. But the bulk of the consumption growth is in Asia and, to a lesser degree, the Middle East. It is to these regions that refiners have migrated. Many newer refineries are more complex than older plants in the west, and thus able to buy a slate of cheaper crudes to make a wider array of fuels and chemicals.“You built to meet the expected growth in the region and have more capacity than is currently required,” says David Greely, commodities analyst at Goldman Sachs.Oil markets are reacting. After Petroplus disclosed the credit freeze on December 27, profit margins for refiners using Brent jumped back into the black. These so-called “crack spreads” have been negative for much of the past year.The price of Brent crude has meanwhile jumped on jitters over Iran, which has threatened to shut down a main tanker route as the west moves towards an embargo on Iranian oil imports. BofA Merrill Lynch nevertheless says Petroplus shutdowns “should increase the availability of light sweet crude oil in Europe” and thus weaken the premium for spot Brent over that of crude for later delivery dates.With the US east coast closures, fuel suppliers may be forced to import more petrol from Europe, while Europe may need to buy more diesel from plants on the US Gulf of Mexico coast.“Greater transportation distance and greater holding of stocks will probably have a cost impact,” says Mindi Farber-DeAnda, EIA oil economist. “We could potentially see higher and more volatile pricing.”……………………………………………………………..Casualty of crisisPetroplus is shaping up to be a casualty of expensive crude and the European debt crisis.Europe’s largest independent refiner on Thursday said all its revolving credit lines were suspended. Petroplus is shutting down its Petit Couronne refinery in France, with 162,000 b/d capacity; Antwerp, Belgium, with 108,000 b/d capacity; and Cressier, Switzerland, with 68,000 b/d capacity. Its UK and German refineries are still open.The company’s losses mounted after high-quality crude prices soared when Libya’s output stopped last year, while Europe’s fuel demand is sluggish."
203;COP;Conocophillips;2012-01-04T23:25:59Z;Chevron’s Ecuador case takes new twist;Lawyers plan to pursue oil group in other countries;Lawyers acting for plaintiffs suing Chevron, the US oil group, over pollution in Ecuador plan to pursue the American company with legal actions in other countries after an Ecuadorean court upheld an $18bn damages award.Pablo Fajardo, an Ecuador-based lawyer representing the 30,000 plaintiffs suing over environmental damage in the Amazon region, said: “It’s not going to be easy to enforce this judgment, but even if hell freezes over we’re going to do it.”Chevron, which denounced the judgment as “procured through a corrupt and fraudulent scheme” has no assets in Ecuador, so the plaintiffs will be forced to bring actions in other countries.Mr Fajardo said: “This judgment gives us the ability to go ahead and enforce the ruling in any part of the world where we see fit.”The legal saga, which has had plenty of twists and turns since the first action was launched back in 1993, appears to have still more to come.The fight has dragged on thanks in large part to the dogged persistence of Steven Donziger, the plaintiffs’ controversial US-based lawyer. While Chevron remains adamant in its rejection of the case against it, the company could yet end up having to pay a multi-billion dollar settlement to resolve the issue.Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, says: “At the very beginning, it didn’t look as though the case was going anywhere. Oil companies get sued every day by everyone, everywhere, and most of the cases we never hear about.”Now he expects Chevron to agree to pay $2bn-$3bn to bring the dispute to an end.For Chevron, the second-biggest US oil and gas group by market capitalisation, the battle has been infuriating, not least because it has never operated in Ecuador.The pollution that is the subject of the case is alleged to have been caused by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001. By then, Texaco had been out of the Amazon region for almost a decade, having pulled out of its joint venture with Petroecuador, the state-run oil company, in 1992.Ecuador’s government signed an agreement saying that Texaco had cleaned up the area as required, but that did not prevent civil claims. In and around Lago Agrio, the rough and tumble oil town where Texaco helped found Ecuador’s oil industry, locals have come forward alleging damage to the land and their health. In the jungle, deep pits as big as swimming pools filled with crude oil are testament to the scars that the oil industry has left on the region. However, Chevron argues that it is Petroecuador, which was sole owner of the oilfields after 1992, that is responsible for the pollution.1993 Plaintiffs file suit against Texaco for widespread pollution in Lago Agrio in a US federal court.2002 Case is thrown out on appeal on the condition that Texaco agree to Ecuadorean jurisdiction.2003 Plaintiffs file against the new owner, Chevron, in the Lago Agrio court.2009 Judge Juan Nuňez recuses himself from the case after being secretly filmed discussing the case. He is later disbarred.Plaintiffs use celebrities to bring attention to the case and Joe Berlinger premieres a sympathetic documentary, Crude. Outtakes from Crude, subpoenaed by Chevron, later deal a significant blow to the plaintiffs, when US-based lawyer Steven Donziger, a leading figure in the litigation for many years, is filmed discussing corruption in Ecuador and strategies for intimidating judges.Kohn, Swift and Graf, a Philadelphia based firm that spent at least $7m litigating the Chevron case, withdraws its involvement amid a dispute with Mr Donziger, before the Crude outtakes came to light.Chevron publicly gives up hope of a favourable verdict from the Ecuadorean court branding the case a “shakedown” and turns to US courts and the Hague.2011 Panel of arbitrators at the Hague order Ecuador to take “all measures at its disposal” to block enforcement of any ruling until it rules on the case. Ecuador appeals. A week later judge Nicolas Zambrano of the Lago Agrio court orders Chevron to pay $8.6bn in damages, which would more than double if the company refuses to give a public apology.Rafael Correa, Ecuador’s president, calls it “the most important judgment in the history of the country”.2012 Yesterday’s ruling against Chevron sets the scene for a series of legal battles in countries were Chevron has assets.By Naomi Mapstone in LimaThe US company was confident enough in the strength of its argument that it sought to have the case heard in Ecuador. Its reaction to Tuesday’s decision, which upheld a ruling from another court last year, was furious.“Today’s decision is another glaring example of the politicisation and corruption of Ecuador’s judiciary that has plagued this fraudulent case from the start,” it said in a statement.“Chevron does not believe that the Ecuador ruling is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of law.”So far, investors have shared that view. Chevron’s shares closed just 0.1 per cent lower on Wednesday.That move followed an excellent 2011 for Chevron’s investors: over the past 12 months, their shares have risen 20 per cent, compared with 14 per cent for the larger ExxonMobil and just 8 per cent for smaller ConocoPhillips.Even for a company of Chevron’s size, $18bn would be a significant hit: about 8 per cent of its market capitalisation. But investors seem not to believe that the award, the second-largest environmental damages award ever imposed on an oil company, after the $20bn compensation for victims of the Gulf of Mexico spill agreed by BP, will be paid.For now, that assessment looks justified. There are further legal contests to come in US courts and at the international court of arbitration in The Hague.Kevin Koenig, a Quito-based spokesman for Amazon Watch, a campaign group, argues that it is time for Chevron to “do the right thing and respect the judgment”, but concedes that it is unlikely the case will be resolved soon.However, he said Chevron had made a “serious miscalculation” in forcing the plaintiffs to pursue the company in foreign courts.Chevron has significant assets in other Latin American countries, including Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil, where the US group has been targeted by regulators over an oil spill and faces a damages claim for $10.6bn. Mr Donziger’s team is reluctant to say exactly where it will take the action next, but moves in one or more of those countries, or in Europe, are possible.“Chevron has to win every one of those cases. The plaintiffs will only need to win one,” Mr Koenig says. John Watson, Chevron’s chief executive, is adamant that the company should not pay anything for what it regards as a fraudulent case, Mr Gheit says. However, as the dispute heats up, the argument for reaching a deal grows stronger.“When the dog keeps on barking and barking, eventually you have to throw it a bone,” says Mr Gheit.
204;COP;Conocophillips;2011-12-29T18:43:56Z;Gas oil futures rise on refinery closing worries;;Prices of crude oil and key heating and motor fuels diverged as traders contemplated the possible shutdown of European refineries.Petroplus, the largest independent European refiner, this week shocked energy markets with the disclosure that lenders had frozen credit. This raised the prospect that some or all of its five European refineries could be closed, removing as much as half a million barrels of production capacity from the fuels market.Any impact could reach across the Atlantic, as the continent exports petrol to the US. Weak demand and high crude prices have already prompted Sunoco and ConocoPhillips to idle three refineries that represent more than half the capacity on the US east coast, which includes large metropolitan areas such as New York.ICE January gas oil futures, a benchmark for distillates such as heating oil, diesel and jet fuel, jumped 1.1 per cent to $928.50 a tonne in London. Its New York counterpart, Nymex January heating oil, rose 0.8 per cent to $2.9175 a gallon.Crude oil rose less. ICE February Brent, the European benchmark, gained 45 cents, or 0.4 per cent, to $108.01 a barrel. Nymex February West Texas Intermediate added 29 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $99.65.Crude futures saw pressure after the US Department of Energy reported US commercial crude stocks rose 3.9m barrels last week to 327.5m barrels, bucking analyst expectations of a decline. A 1.2m barrel rise in US distillate stocks failed to stem the rise in gas oil and heating oil futures.The divergent prices for fuels and crude widened the “crack spread”, the notional profit for oil refineries. With the potential for less worldwide capacity, surviving refineries could see less competition as they buy crude and sell fuels.Swiss-based Petroplus shares lost more than half their value this week after mounting losses this year spurred its banks to freeze a $1.1bn loan facility. The group warned that the credit facility was “critical to allow the company’s operating units to meet their obligations when due”.Petromatrix, a Swiss-based oil consultancy, said Petroplus was planning to refine about 500,000 barrels a day in the current quarter before the crisis.“If refineries were to shut, I think it would be very supportive of the distillate markets,” said Olivier Jakob, head of Petromatrix.
205;COP;Conocophillips;2011-12-20T19:34:54Z;BP, Total and Statoil secure Angola rights;;A new exploration frontier off the coast of Angola that may be similar to oil fields found in Brazil is to be opened after the government of the African country awarded drilling rights to some of the world’s largest energy groups.Britain’s BP, Total of France and Norway’s Statoil all secured licences to explore in Angola’s pre-salt deposits – a layer of salt accumulated millions of years ago under the sea. The blocks awarded share promising geological similarities with the prolific Santos and Campos Basins in Brazil where large discoveries have been made in recent years.ConocoPhillips, Cobalt International Energy, ENI of Italy and Spain’s Repsol also secured rights to blocks, Manuel Vicente, chairman of Angola’s state oil company Sonangol said on Tuesday.“The Angolan pre-salt is a frontier play with high potential, believed to be analogous to pre-salt Brazil,” said Tim Dodson, Statoil’s vice-president for exploration.“Early access to a multiple-block portfolio in exploring this new play gives Statoil exposure to significant upside potential should the play be proven,” he added.“The oil industry has been waiting for this for a year and a half,” said John Olaisen, analyst at Carnegie Investment Bank in Norway. The companies, he said, were paying “high signature bonuses”.“They are typical for West Africa but these are among the highest we have ever seen.” Statoil, he estimated, had paid close to $1bn for its stakes. Statoil said in its statement that its total exposure, which included the bonus as well as the planned work programme, was $1.4bn.“We expect 10 per cent of the global marine seismic fleet could be in Angola in the second quarter of 2012,” he added.BP said it had signed production sharing agreements for four new blocks covering 19,400 square km in the Kwanza and Benguela basins. The awards, including a 40 per cent stake in a separate block in the Benguela basin, mean the British group now has interests in nine blocks, accounting for a total acreage of 32,650 square km.“This new access builds on the major presence we have developed in Angola over the past 10 years, investing a total of $21bn in the business,” said Bob Dudley, BP chief executive.The company, which is still recovering from last year’s Gulf of Mexico spill, has announced plans to double its global spend on exploration in a bid to recover some of value it lost. Over the past 14 months the company has secured 69 new exploration licences in 11 countries. However, BP’s shares have continued to languish this year amid investor concerns over the impending litigation in the US over the gulf accident. They closed up 1.6 per cent at 444.65p in London.In a similar vein to BP, Total earlier this year said it intended to spend more on exploration in a bid to re-invigorate its strategy. The company said it would increase its net capital expenditure to an average of $23bn a year over the next four years, up from an average of $18.5bn over the past two years.
206;COP;Conocophillips;2011-12-02T23:56:51Z;ConocoPhillips plans $10bn share buy-back;;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil group by market capitalisation, has announced a 15 per cent rise in planned capital spending and a $10bn share buy-back plan, as part of the radical restructuring that will split the company in two.The group plans $15.5bn of capital spending next year, of which about 90 per cent will be in the upstream oil and gas exploration and production business. Just 8 per cent will be in the downstream refining and marketing division, which is to be made a separate company, called Phillips 66.Conoco said the upstream investment would focus on areas such as onshore oil production in shale formations in the US, tar sands in Canada and coal bed methane in Australia.The share buy-back represents about 11 per cent of the company’s equity at its market price of $72.55 a share. The previous plan, covering 2010-11, is expected to have repurchased about 15 per cent of the company’s equity at a cost of $15bn.The company also said disposals already announced since 2010 would raise $10.5bn, taking it more than halfway towards its target of $15bn-$20bn of asset sales by 2012.Jim Mulva, the chief executive who plans to step down when the company splits, said it was optimising its portfolio “by divesting low-return, non-core assets”.He added: “We are well positioned to meet our three-year target and position the company for growth and enhanced rates of return.”
207;COP;Conocophillips;2011-12-01T20:42:54Z;Cemex Venezuela: we’re outta here;;"The $600m compensation agreement that Cemex finally reached with Venezuela’s government after its subsidiary was nationalised may be less than it wanted, and it may have taken the best part of four years. But at least it’s all over.Frankly, the Mexican cement company should count itself lucky. Not only is it going to get almost half what it was said to be originally asking ($1.3bn according to the government); it also no longer has to put up with the stress of doing business in Venezuela.In terms of compensation, others have not been so fortunate. In total there are about 20 international arbitration cases resulting from Hugo Chávez’s nationalisation spree.Take the high profile cases dragging on between oil majors Exxon Mobil and Conoco Phillips and Venezuela’s combative government. The two companies were initially asking for more than $40bn in combined compensation, in stark contrast to state oil company PDVSA’s calculation of what the assets were worth: less than $2bn. In any case, energy minister Rafael Ramirez said this week that a verdict is expected before the year is out, so we will soon find out who gets the better of whom – even if the companies’ initial $40bn demand was admittedly borderline outrageous.As for the stress of doing business in Venezuela, just have a look at what Italian milk producer Parmalat has had to go through recently. It had to stoop to writing a public letter of apology to Chavez this week, having provoked his ire after a very public spat over alleged milk hoarding.“We respectfully address you to offer our most sincere apologies,” Parmalat’s letter began, explaining that in essentially accusing the government of shooting itself in the foot, the company had failed to communicate its position clearly after national guards confiscated over 200 tonnes of its milk.“In no way did we intend to minimise the effort your honourable government and other public bodies make in favour of food supplies on a national level and the protection of consumers, of which we are co-participators and active collaborators for the good of Venezuelans,” Parmalat’s submissive statement continued. “Rest assured we will keep working positively… collaborating with all the important initiatives suggested by your government.”At least Cemex has put that sort of thing behind it. Cement is a product that in Venezuela is just as politically sensitive as milk. There are often shortages of both. No prizes for guessing who gets blamed when that happens.Related reading:

208;COP;Conocophillips;2011-11-23T12:25:56Z;Cnooc names a new chief executive;Move comes after a series of setbacks for the oil and gas producer;By Leslie Hook in BeijingCnooc Ltd, China’s largest offshore oil and gas producer by volume, has named a new chief executive, following a series of setbacks, accidents and failed deals earlier in the year.Li Fanrong, 48, an engineer who has been with the company for nearly 30 years, will assume the title of chief executive, replacing Yang Hua, who will continue at the company as vice-chairman of the board and non-executive director.The shuffle comes less than a year after former Cnooc chairman Fu Chengyu left the company to take up the reins at rival Sinopec, China’s largest oil refining company.Cnooc has encountered several setbacks this year, most recently the failure of its $3.5bn deal to buy a stake in Pan American Energy, the Argentinean energy group, from BP.Cnooc’s offshore oil field in the Bohai Bay remains unproductive after leaks from the ocean floor prompted the government to shut it down earlier in the year. The field, which was operated by ConocoPhillips and 51 per cent owned by Cnooc, was producing about 40,000 barrels of oil a day before it was closed down.The company is also awaiting final Ugandan government approvals for its deal with Total to buy stakes in offshore oil fields from Tullow Oil.“This latest management reshuffle is positive for Cnooc in the long run,” said Gordon Kwan, energy analyst at Mirae Asset Securities.“Judging by their past track records, Yang Hua’s strength is in developing strategy, while Mr Li has extensive experience in operations safety management. The latter has become Cnooc’s top priority following the recent oil spills tragedies in Bohai Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, as the firm moves into deeper waters for exploring oil and gas,” Mr Kwan added.The new chief executive spent the first decade of his career working as an engineer and platform supervisor in the South China Sea. He has an MBA from the business school of Cardiff University and a degree in oil production from Jiang Han Petroleum Institute.Mr Li was appointed president and non-executive director of Cnooc in September this year and immediately prior to that his title was vice-president.Wang Yilin, 55, will continue in his role of chairman of the board at Cnooc.
209;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
210;COP;Conocophillips;2011-11-22T23:38:06Z;Gas: Resource that has too easily gone to waste;Aim is to supply power stations and manufacturing, says Christopher Thompson;The orange flames on the horizon from the rigs off the Niger delta illuminate the fact that Nigeria has yet to exploit one of its most valuable natural resources: gas.Although revenue from oil props up the economy, it is natural gas that could power it. The country has an estimated 187,000bn cubic feet of gas, the eighth-biggest reserves in the world, which are largely untapped.Most of the blame lies with the government. In its previous “gas master plan” in 2008 it tried to get companies to sell at least half of their gas production in Nigeria. But uncertain revenue streams and the billions of dollars in investment needed to channel gas to the nation’s power stations did not appeal to investors.The government says that flaring has been cut by more than half in the past four years. But given the lack of infrastructure needed to transport the gas for commercial use, the problem remains what to do after it has been stored. “Gathering the flared gas costs money. But what can the oil companies do with the captured gas,” asks Jon Marks, editorial director of African Energy, the magazine. “If you are able to monetise it, especially meeting domestic demand, then all of a sudden there’s much more incentive to do it.”There are signs the government may be translating talk into action, prompted by privatisation in the electricity sector. Last year, according to official documents, the power ministry expressed an “urgent need” to source 2bn cu ft more gas a day by expanding existing gathering and supply infrastructure to meet the government’s target of generating 16,000MW of electricity by 2013.That followed moves by Diezani Alison-Madueke, the minister of petroleum resources, to introduce a phased rise in gas prices, fixed by the state, to $2 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) to boost supply, especially to the country’s struggling manufacturers. The price will reach $3 per mcf by the end of 2013. “Gas is central to the power equation,” says Mr Marks. “It’s the clean fuel that can clean up the Nigerian economy.”Chevron of the US is building a $2bn plant in Delta state to convert gas from its Escravos field into diesel fuels.Meanwhile, the government hopes to provide gas to far more ambitious manufacturing projects. In March, it signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia’s Xenel, Chevron, and Nagarjuna, an Indian agro-processing company, for $10bn of investment in 10 plants.Xenel will invest in a $3.5bn petrochemical plant that is expected to produce 1.3m tonnes a year of polypropylene and polyethylene, key ingredients in plastic bags, textiles, carpets, stationery, car parts and banknotes.Nagarjuna’s two plants will cost $2.5bn, each with a capacity of 1.3m tonnes year and will be located in Koko, Delta state, and Lagos.There are challenges in the export sector too, as the government’s most ambitious project, a proposed 4,300km trans-Saharan pipeline to Algeria to export gas to Europe, has been quietly deferred.In 2010, Nigeria was the fifth-largest LNG (liquefied natural gas) supplier in the world, accounting for 18.1m tonnes out of a total world demand of 223.8m tonnes.The government hopes to cement its position by expanding LNG facilities at Bonny Island and to build fresh projects aimed at the North American market. The Bonny Island LNG terminal – jointly owned by the NNPC (Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation), Anglo-Dutch Shell, France’s Total and Italy’s Eni – plans to add a seventh LNG train in 2012 which would increase overall export capacity to more than 30m tonnes a year (tpa),Two other big LNG projects in development are the four-train Olokola plant (projected production 22m tpa) and the long-awaited $10bn two-train Brass LNG project in Bayelsa state that could export up to 10m tpa.Brass’s equity is held by the NNPC, ConocoPhillips, Eni and Total, but progress has been stymied by militant unrest in the Niger delta and market uncertainty since the original memorandum of understanding was signed in 2001.That has been partially mitigated by the government opening bids in the summer for engineering, procurement and construction work, and by the NNPC’s announcement in August that it had secured a much-needed $2bn loan from a consortium of Japanese banks after offering a shareholding in the project to LNG Japan.But doubts remain, mainly because of politics. Analysts do not expect any final investment decision to be made until the government clarifies the industry’s fiscal and operational terms.That means the passage, or otherwise, of the Petroleum Industry Bill currently stuck in parliament. Time is running out, however.“The PIB is on track,” says the NNPC. “But the final investment decision [on Brass LNG] must be taken by the first quarter of next year, otherwise customers looking for long-term agreements will look elsewhere.”
211;COP;Conocophillips;2011-11-16T23:00:16Z;US crude jumps on pipeline reversal plan;;US crude oil futures sprang back above $100 a barrel on plans to reverse a key pipeline that would reconnect the supply of West Texas Intermediate to global markets.Enbridge, a Canadian pipeline company, said it would pay ConocoPhillips $1.15bn to buy a 50 per cent stake in the Seaway pipeline and, together with co-owner Enterprise Products Partners, would reverse it to run south from landlocked Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf of Mexico.The plan had important implications for energy markets. Elevated stocks in and around Cushing, the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate crude listed by CME Group, have caused the oil blend to trade at a severe discount to similar oil types, challenging its status as a benchmark.The plan unveiled Wednesday is the first attempt to reverse an existing pipeline to help drain Cushing’s 32m barrels in inventories.“The bottleneck is being resolved,” said Antoine Halff, economist at the Energy Information Administration in Washington. “This is going to cause inventories to rebalance and prices to realign between inland and coastal locations.”US crude for December delivery rose $3.22 to $102.59 a barrel, surpassing $100 for the first time since July. Brent, the benchmark linked to North Sea oilfields, fell 30 cents to $111.88. Last month the US benchmark briefly dipped to a $28-a-barrel discount to Brent.Andy Lipow, president of consultants Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said: “The spread could continue to narrow as any crude oil inventory overhang is moved down to the Gulf coast.”Betting on the spread has become a popular trade among hedge funds and trading houses, with some analysts arguing that the glut around Cushing could cause the spread to blow out to more than $40. Barges and trains already handle some of the surplus.The pipeline plans also hit shares of US refining companies that have enjoyed discounted oils linked to Cushing. CVR Energy fell 16.3 per cent, HollyFrontier was down 10 per cent and Western Refining dropped 13.5 per cent.“For Midwest refineries, it’s welcome back to reality,” said Michael Wittner, oil analyst at Société Générale.Enbridge and Enterprise said that the reversed line could carry 150,000 barrels a day by the second quarter of 2012. By early 2013, capacity would rise to 400,000 b/d.As the US state department extends a review of TransCanada’s Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada’s oil sands to Texas amid environmental concerns, the Seaway project could help deliver similar crude to Texas by a different route. Cushing’s stocks have soared with an influx from Canada, the US’s largest foreign crude supplier, and North Dakota.Enbridge and Enterprise had earlier proposed a new, 800,000 b/d pipeline from Cushing to Houston called Wrangler. That project will now be incorporated into Seaway, Enterprise said.“The Seaway Pipeline reversal provides an early opportunity to offer Gulf coast access to midcontinent producers and other crude oil shippers,” said Patrick Daniel, Enbridge chief executive. “A Seaway reversal will provide capacity to move secure, reliable supply to Texas Gulf coast refineries, offsetting supplies of imported crude”.
212;COP;Conocophillips;2011-11-16T20:44:15Z;Small caps: 3Legs falls after well disappoints;;Shale gas explorer 3Legs Resources tumbled 39.9 per cent to 81¾p, after reporting lower than expected flow rates at a well in the Baltic basin of Poland. The company and partner ConocoPhillips suspended tests at the prospect “for an extended period of several months” due to high costs and subzero temperatures.Chaired by Tim Eggar, a former Conservative minister for Industry and Energy, 3Legs floated on Aim in June at 190p per share, which valued the company at £161m. Since peaking in July, the stock has lost two-thirds of its value, in spite of a more promising report in September from its first well at the site.“If reopened, we expect the companies to come back with simpler, cheaper test equipment in the spring once temperatures are above freezing,” said Jefferies, which managed 3Legs’ flotation.It maintained “buy” advice, arguing: “We believe the Polish Baltic basin continues to exhibit positive characteristics that could allow for successful shale exploitation. We believe it is not unreasonable for it to take more than the two well results we have available to date to determine optimal completion design.”Game Group plunged 46.1 per cent to 10¼p after a profit warning, with the retailer blaming deteriorating consumer confidence for a 10.6 per cent fall in group sales over the past 41 weeks.Seymour Pierce predicted full-year losses for the company, advising that “management needs to take cost out more radically by cutting its UK store portfolio back more aggressively”. However, it forecast an improvement in profitability in 2013.A second profit warning in seven months prompted shares in AEA Technology to slump 85.8 per cent to 0.28p. The environmental consultancy, which was spun out of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, also announced the resignation of chief executive Andrew McCree and said it was discussing its loan facility and related covenants with Lloyds Bank, its sole lender.Hampson Industries, the aerospace components and tooling supplier, dropped 20 per cent to a record low of 4½p. The company revealed first-half revenues down 7.9 per cent, exacerbated by a 20 per cent fall in revenues at the Odyssey facility in its tooling division.Investec said that the results were marginally ahead of its expectations, though it retained a “hold” recommendation. “The stock remains high risk and the outcome for the next six months is binary but for those willing to take a view, we can see potentially material upside from here,” it said.Football club Tottenham Hotspur announced plans to delist from Aim, arguing that the listing had restricted its ability to secure funds to expand its stadium. The shares in Tottenham, which dropped 23.9 per cent to 35p, are expected to stop trading on 13 January 2012. The club also revealed a £402,000 pre-tax profit in the year to June 30, up from a £6.5m loss a year earlier.Bango, the mobile payments manager, dropped 19.2 per cent to 52½p after saying it would miss full-year forecasts. Liberum Capital forecast 2012 revenue expectations to come down by at least £10m, denting profit expectations by £200,000.
213;COP;Conocophillips;2011-11-01T13:32:00Z;Energy: Shale could help break Russia’s grip on gas;A nascent industry with huge reserves might bring security to the country and region, says Adam Easton;Poland is hoping to start producing shale gas in two years, as it begins to develop an industry that could free the country from dependence on Russian supplies and turn it into an energy exporter.Shale gas could help the country meet its growing energy needs while meeting ever stricter climate change targets set by the European Commission.Poland is heavily reliant on coal, which currently accounts for more than 90 per cent of electricity production. Using more gas in its energy mix would help it meet reduction requirements because gas produces roughly half the CO2 emissions that coal does.According to the US Energy Information Agency, Poland has recoverable shale gas reserves of 5.3 trillion cubic metres. This could equate to annual production of up to 100bn cu m (bcm), said a report last month by the Kosciuszko Institute, a Polish think-tank.To put those figures into perspective, the country consumes about 14 bcm a year of gas, 70 per cent of which comes from Russia.The prospects are so attractive that big oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have scrambled to acquire acreage in the past four years.Shale gas is found in relatively impermeable rock and its extraction requires a technique known as hydraulic fracturing – or fracking. Large quantities of water and sand and small amounts of chemicals are pumped into man-made fractures in the rock.This props open the fractures and allows the gas to flow so that it can be brought to the surface.Estimates of Poland’s reserves are preliminary and based on old core samples. But the first wells have now been drilled and the signs are encouraging.Kamlesh Parmar, country manager for 3Legs Re­sources, which “fracked” Poland’s first shale gas well, says: “The question of whether shale gas is there or not has been answered, because we’ve managed to produce shale gas from our wells.“The issue is about the economics now, and can we do this in a way that will result in an industry being created.”He adds: “I believe that as long as the drilling programmes go the way we want and everything goes to plan, then getting some meaningful production out of our licences should be possible in a two to five year window.”Shale gas could bring energy security to both Poland and much of Europe.In the Kosciuszko Institute report, Alan Riley, professor of law at City University, London, writes that even if Europe were to access just 10 per cent of its estimated recoverable shale gas reserves, that would be equivalent to one-third of Russia’s total reserves.Unlike gas from Russia, it would be on-site in the required market area, making it very competitive against supplies brought all the way from Siberia.At the moment, Poland is locked into buying gas from Russia because it lacks alternative pipelines to the infrastructure set up in Soviet times.As a result, it buys two-thirds of its supplies from Gazprom at crude oil-indexed prices under a take-or-pay contract, which expires in 2022.If a thriving European shale industry were created causing prices to fall, Gazprom could be forced to sell its gas at more competitive rates.Katarzyna Kacperczyk, director of the Polish foreign ministry’s economic policy department, says shale gas has the potential to be a “game changer”.“When we look at it optimistically, if costs go down and we can recover considerable volumes of gas, we believe that in the short term we will use the gas domestically. But in the medium and long-term, we might be able to export some,” she says.Ms Kacperczyk says several ministries are working on a regulatory framework for shale gas production to ensure the state receives a “fair” return from production.The opposition Law and Justice party wants to charge companies a minimum production fee, with the state receiving at least 40 per cent of the sales value of the gas.The government is looking for a scheme that provides significant financial benefits for the state – which could be invested in a “rainy day” fund – but does not act as a disincentive to investment.Environmental concerns, particularly about shale gas drilling contaminating groundwater – which have led to a moratorium on exploration in France and calls inside the European Parliament for an EU-wide halt – do not appear to have captured the Polish public’s imagination.A recent survey found that 74 per cent of Poles support production. Concerns over the dangers of being dependent on an old imperial master appear to outweigh environmental worries for many.
214;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-31T22:37:31Z;Anadarko posts loss after BP settlement;Gulf of Mexico spill charge results in $3.1bn shortfall;Anadarko Petroleum reported a large quarterly loss on Monday after the US oil and gas company took a charge to pay for a $4bn settlement with BP over claims relating to the devastating oil spill from the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico last year.The deal with BP, reached earlier this month, involves a large cash payment but in effect caps Anadarko’s potential exposure to the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, due to its minority stake in the well. Anadarko could still be on the hook for certain fines but expects those to have a minimal impact.In a statement on Monday evening, Jim Hackett, chief executive of Anadarko, said the agreement was “the right action for our stakeholders, as it removes significant uncertainty regarding future liabilities and associated risks”.As the Gulf crisis unfolded live on TV screens thanks to several underwater cameras, Anadarko shares lost about half of their value. But they recovered strongly in the latter part of 2010 and have added 3 per cent over the year to date.For the three months to the end of September, Anadarko reported a net loss of about $3.1bn, or about $6.12 per share. That compares with a net loss of $26m, or $0.05 per share, in the third quarter of 2010.The BP settlement and a series of charges for losses on certain derivatives contracts and the sale of properties reduced Anadarko’s third-quarter net income by about $3.4bn after tax, or $6.78 per share.Mr Hackett said the BP deal would allow investors to focus on the company’s “operational and exploration success” that he claimed had been “undervalued during the last 18 months”.Over the past few years, Anadarko has developed a reputation for its knack of finding new reserves after discovering a series of huge oil deposits near countries such as Brazil, Ghana and Sierra Leone.At the same time, the company has been at the forefront of the rise in shale gas production in the US, exploiting new technologies to extract previously inaccessible reserves from its holdings in areas such as the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania.Those new developments helped the company to boosts its production volumes by 5 per cent to 61m barrels of oil equivalent during the quarter and combined with rebouding gas prices to push up revenues by about 25 per cent to $3.2bn.Anadarko’s success in raising production contrasts with recent reports from companies such as ExxonMobil, BP and ConocoPhillips, which have been hit by production declines due to factors including resource nationalism and ageing conventional oil fields.During the quarter, Anadarko invested slightly less than it expected on capital projects and as a result the company cut its forecast for full-year capital spending by $200m to between $6.1bn and $6.4bn, while modestly raising its outlook for 2011 sales volumes.In after-market trading, Anadarko shares dipped about 1 per cent to $78.01.
215;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-31T20:25:52Z;China steps in where America finds it less necessary to tread;;A deal to build a $10bn oil refinery on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia is expected to be signed soon – but under terms revealingly different from those originally foreseen.Saudi Aramco, the Riyadh state oil group, was due to have constructed the facility with ConocoPhillips of the US – only for the American company to pull out last year and leave the field open China’s state-controlled Sinopec.The changed dance card for the 400,000 barrel a day project is one sign of a gradual switch in oil-rich Middle Eastern states’ attention away from Washington and towards Beijing. Analysts says the trend is significant but also slow, nuanced and unlikely to lead any time soon to China replacing the US as the main outside security force in the region.Walid Khadduri, a consultant for Middle East Economic Survey, a newsletter, says: “This is a long-term story we are talking about. The oil industry doesn’t change overnight.”The most symbolic point yet in this unfolding tale came in 2009, when China temporarily overtook the US as the biggest buyer of crude from Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter.Given the wider economic factors in play – a decreasing US reliance on Middle Eastern imports and China’s industrial expansion – many expect Beijing to emerge clearly as Riyadh’s largest oil client over the next few years. According to the US Energy Information Administration, US oil imports from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries were only 1.71m b/d last year, down from 2.76m b/d in 2001 and 2.37m b/d as recently as 2008.Conversely, overall trade between China and the Arab world reached a record $120bn in the first half of this year, according to Chinese figures, a rise of 36 per cent on the previous year – albeit inflated by higher oil prices.But many say the changing oil trade patterns are commercially rather than politically motivated as far as the Middle Eastern crude producers are concerned. This means the US is neither likely to be shut out of those markets nor pressed to close its military bases in the region.Analysts also note that China is not the only Asian game in town: while it is important for Iraq’s oil industry, for example, the United Arab Emirates has significant ties with Japan and South Korea, too. Robin Mills at Manaar, a Dubai-based energy consultancy, says that while there is a “clear eastwards shift” in the oil trade, it is too variable to be viewed just as part of an emerging Chinese hegemony over the US. He said: “You have really got to look at the countries case by case.”
216;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-28T14:12:23Z;Chevron reports drop in production;;Chevron, the second-biggest oil company in the US by market capitalisation, followed the industry trend in reporting a drop in production even as its third-quarter earnings more than doubled on higher prices for crude oil and refined products.Chevron’s global net oil-equivalent production was 2.6m barrels per day in the third quarter, down from 2.74m bpd in the same period last year, on maturing fields and maintenance-related downtime.ExxonMobil, BP and ConocoPhillips also noted production declines in the quarter, with only Royal Dutch Shell reporting a third-quarter rise, driven by its oil sands projects in Canada and gas in Qatar.Replacing production is crucial to the growth profiles of the oil majors but all have been hampered by resource nationalism, ageing conventional oil fields and the high cost of developing unconventional resources.Such resources are key to future growth and Chevron said its development of the Wheatstone and Gorgon liquefied natural gas projects in Australia, for example, would provide substantial new energy supplies.But those are long-term projects. In this quarter, Chevron reported production increases from projects in Canada, the US and Brazil, but these were offset by the maintenance issues and normal field declines. Nonetheless, Chevron’s US exploration and production earnings were $1.51bn in the third quarter, up $562m from the year-earlier quarter, on higher prices.Chevron’s international exploration and production earnings were $4.69bn, up $2.08bn from the third quarter of 2010, but analysts had been expecting more. Weighing on those earnings, Chevron said, were higher tax charges and a damaged pipeline in Thailand.“The key question marks around the results mainly centre on a miss in international exploration and production earnings,” said Edward Westlake, oil industry analyst at Credit Suisse Equity Research.Chevron’s total earnings of $7.8bn, or $3.92 a share, beat analysts’ forecasts of $3.48 and were up from $3.8bn, or $1.87 per share, in the year-earlier quarter.Chevron’s refining sector benefited from asset sales, including those in the UK and Ireland, and improved margins. Its total refining and marketing earnings were $1.99bn, up from $565m in the year-earlier quarter.It also continued to spend heavily, with $20.8bn in capital and exploratory expenditures in the first nine months of 2011, up from $15.5bn in the year-earlier period.For the quarter, Chevron reported sales and other operating revenue of $61bn, up from $48bn in the year-earlier quarter, on higher prices.It announced a quarterly dividend of 81 cents a share and its shares were flat at $109.30 in midday New York trading.
217;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Exxon boosted by commodity prices;;ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest international oil company by market capitalisation, suffered a drop in production in the third quarter but high commodity prices helped it report a 41 per cent rise in earnings.Exxon said field declines, divestments and Opec quotas led to a 4 per cent drop in oil-equivalent production, which followed a trend established by BP and ConocoPhillips, who reported production hits earlier in the week.All of the oil majors are facing difficulty in lifting production amid heightened resource nationalism and maturing conventional oilfields, which has led them to focus on unconventional production, such as shale and Canada’s oil sands, to ensure profits.“In spite of breakthroughs, most fields begin declining once production has begun, and so the challenge is to constantly find new production to replace the old,’’ said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. “The bigger you are, the bigger the challenge.”In light of this, Exxon’s capital expenditure was $8.6bn in the third quarter, bringing this to a record level of $26.7bn for the first nine months of the year.“We believe ExxonMobil has a more positive outlook from 2013 onwards, when current capital expenditures start to pay off,” said Edward Westlake, oil industry analyst at Credit Suisse Equity Research.In the third quarter, the company also signed a strategic co-operation agreement with Rosneft to develop Arctic and Black Sea resources, expand technology sharing and execute joint international projects.Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive, said: “We continue pursuing new opportunities to meet growing energy demand while supporting economic growth.”Exxon reported third-quarter earnings of $10.3bn, or $2.13 per share, up from $7.4bn, or $1.44 per share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts had forecast $2.13 of earnings per share.The company distributed more than $7bn to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share buy-backs. It paid a third-quarter dividend of 47 cents per share, up 7 per cent over the year-earlier quarter.In the exploration and production division, Exxon reported earnings of $8.4bn, up $2.9bn from the third quarter of 2010. Liquids production (oil and natural gas liquids) was down slightly, while natural gas production remained flat with the third quarter of 2010.In the refining and marketing division, Exxon reported earnings of $1.6bn, up $419m from the third quarter of 2010, on strong refining margins. Its chemical division recorded earnings of $1bn, $226m lower than the third quarter of 2010, on lower volumes and higher taxes.Investors responded by pushing Exxon’s share price up 0.4 per cent to $81.38 in midday trade.
218;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConocoPhillips adds risk to Brent-WTI trade;Oil group’s move to sell pipeline stake adds to uncertainty;The Brent-WTI spread is a nerve-racking trade with dealers weathering uncertain events such as the Libyan revolution, North Sea output glitches and uncertainty over transporting US oil by rail.If it was not complicated enough, ConocoPhillips added another unexpected factor on Wednesday when it said it was “actively” trying to sell its stake in a key pipeline that has the potential to send the Brent-WTI spread upside down.Conoco owns half of the “Seaway” pipeline that runs from Freeport, Texas, in the coastal refinery strip of the US Gulf of Mexico, to Cushing, the Oklahoman town that serves as the delivery point for the West Texas Intermediate crude. The pipe, 30 inches in diameter, has a capacity to ship up to 350,000 barrels a day of imported oil up to Cushing, contributing to higher oil inventories in the hub and, thus, depressing the value of WTI relative to Brent crude.WTI used to trade at an average premium of about $1-$2 a barrel against Brent until two years ago, but this year it has plunged to a record discount of more of $28 a barrel. The spread has been one of the favourite trades of commodities hedge funds, banks and physical houses for months. On Wednesday it closed at $18.67 a barrel.Conoco owns several refineries in the US Midcontinent so, one theory goes, has every incentive to ship oil up to Cushing and keep WTI cheaper, thus benefiting from higher refineries margins as oil product prices are unaffected by the build-up in crude inventories.But the pipeline is only carrying half the crude it could, so for months the market has been abuzz about the potential for a reversal, sending oil from Cushing into the US Gulf of Mexico. Conoco has until now been opposed both to the reversal and a sale of the pipeline.The other owner – US-based pipeline company Enterprise – has not shown a clear preference about whether to reverse it or not. But it seems that the reversal would make some business sense to the US pipeline company, likely filling Seaway to capacity and thus earning higher fees. Nonetheless, Enterprise is also looking at building a rival pipeline from Cushing to the US Gulf, so its interests are unclear at this point.The decision by Conoco to look for a buyer could contribute to a rapid reversal, as it eliminates the first obstacle. The risk of a sale would hang over traders, particularly those betting on a widening spread, like the sword of Damocles, for months to come.The reversal, which could take as little as six months, is seen by traders as the quickest way to alleviate the build-up in crude inventories in Cushing, faster than rival proposals to build new pipes by late 2013 or early 2014. The Brent-WTI, which has already claimed several victims amid the hedge fund community, could be looking at new casualties.
219;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Conoco earnings fall on Libyan instability;;ConocoPhillips, the third-biggest US oil company by market capitalisation, reported a 16 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings, citing a range of factors, including suspended operations in Libya and offshore China.The company, which next year will split its exploration and production and its refining operations into two separate companies, on Wednesday reported earnings of $2.6bn, or $1.91 a share, down from $3.1bn, or $2.05 a share, in the same quarter a year earlier.Excluding those special items, Conoco’s adjusted earnings were $3.5bn, or $2.52 per share. Analysts had forecast $2.19 earnings per share.The company is in the midst of a major restructuring, which includes selling up to $20bn in assets and splitting its exploration and production business from its refining operations in two separate companies. The split, which is planned for next year, will mean one division can no longer offset a poor performance in another, making it crucial that both divisions perform well on their own.Yet Conoco said political instability in Libya and a leak in Bohai Bay, offshore China, led to a drop in production to 1.54m oil equivalent barrels per day. Conoco's production was 1.72m barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2010.This erosion in production volumes is expected to be a key theme from international oil companies as they report earnings this week.BP set the tone, reporting on Tuesday that production had fallen 12 per cent to 3.31m barrels of oil equivalent a day compared with the same period last year.ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell are to report earnings on Thursday and Chevron and Total on Friday.Also weighing down Conoco’s production was unplanned downtime in Alaska, longer downtime than planned in the North Sea and a decline in Russian production.Yet the exploration and production segment’s third-quarter earnings were higher because of rising commodity prices. Conoco reported exploration and production earnings of $1.8bn, up from $1.6bn in the third quarter of last year.Conoco’s other main division – refining – performed well, with a global refining capacity utilisation rate of 92 per cent, enabling ConocoPhillips to capture stronger refining margins. That division reported earnings of $789m, up from $268m in the year-earlier period.“This quarter’s results benefited from improved market conditions,” said Jim Mulva, chairman and chief executive.Conoco’s share price was 0.5 per cent higher at $71 in mid-morning trade.
220;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-23T14:59:08Z;Oil majors’ production to be weighed;Chevron indicates ‘comparable’ results;The world’s largest oil companies are reporting third-quarter earnings this week, with investors’ attention likely to be focused on whether they are managing to raise their production, write Ed Crooks and Sylvia Pfeifer.BP, the UK oil group, kicks off the European reporting season on Tuesday. Its clean replacement cost profit, a measure that strips out the value of oil and gas inventories, is expected to be $4.9bn, a decline of 11 per cent on the same period the year before. Production for the quarter is expected to reveal a drop of 12 per cent year-on-year, according to JP Morgan Cazenove.Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s largest international oil company, Eni of Italy and Statoil of Norway all report on Thursday. Shell is forecast to report net income of €6.5bn, up from €4.93bn on the third quarter of 2010.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil group by market capitalisation, also on Thursday reports earnings, which are expected to be about 5 cents below the second-quarter of $2.18 per share, but up 48 per cent on the third quarter of 2010.On Wednesday ConocoPhillips, which is splitting itself in two – one company for oil and gas production, another for refining and marketing – is similarly expected to report earnings up 45 per cent from the equivalent quarter of 2010 at $2.19 per share, according to the average forecast compiled by Thomson Reuters, but down 9 per cent from the second quarter of 2011.Finally on Friday, Chevron, the second-largest US oil group, and Total of France report. Chevron has indicated that results would be “comparable” with the second quarter, when it made earnings of $3.85 per share, implying a doubling over the year from $1.87 in the third quarter of 2010.

221;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-17T18:42:43Z;Statoil buys Brigham Exploration for $4.4bn;Norwegian group steps up acquisition of tight-oil assets;Statoil, the Norwegian energy group, has stepped up its acquisition of unconventional oil and gas assets in the US by agreeing to buy Texas-based oil company Brigham Exploration for $4.4bn.The deal, announced on Monday, will give Statoil access to 375,000 acres in the Bakken shale region in North Dakota, where production of tight oil has helped reverse the decades-long decline in US oil output.Under the terms of the agreement, Statoil will buy all of Brigham’s shares for $36.50 in an all-cash offer, a 20 per cent premium on the closing price on October 14. The total equity value of the deal is about $4.4bn, with an enterprise value of about $4.7bn.The agreement will enable Statoil to join US rivals ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil among the top 10 holders of acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks tight-oil formations, among the largest oil accumulations in the US.Commercial tight-oil extraction is still a relatively new phenomenon although it has increased in the past two years. Tight-oil formations are sometimes known as shale oil because the reserves are often found in the same rocks as shale gas and produced with similar methods.“Entering the Bakken and Three Forks tight-oil plays and taking on operatorship represents a significant step for Statoil,” said Helge Lund, chief executive. “We are positioning ourselves as a leading player in the fast-growing US onshore oil and gas industry.”The company already has positions in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale formations in the US through joint ventures, but this is the first time it has bought a company and become the operator.“We believe we are pretty well positioned now,” said Mr Lund, adding that despite current macro-economic concerns, “the beauty of these projects is in their flexibility in terms of gearing”.The transaction will provide Statoil with equity production of about 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, but the acreage has the potential to ramp to up to 60,000-100,000 boe per day equity production over the next five years, said Mr Lund.Analysts at Bernstein said while the deal would provide Statoil with “access to a reasonable quality growth asset”, current production levels “will not offset declines elsewhere in the portfolio”.“This is certainly an acquisition for growth, rather than for production today,” they added, noting that it would not “fix Statoil’s problem of declining production due to its high exposure to mature areas in Norway”.Under Mr Lund, Statoil, which operates about 80 per cent of Norway’s oil and gas production, has expanded into unconventional gas as well as deepwater regions such as Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico.
222;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-14T16:48:44Z;BP wins approval for N Sea field;;When so many companies are firing, it’s headline news when someone is hiring – even more so when the company is BP and the region it is investing in is the North Sea, written off by many as a mature oil and gas province.The UK oil group announced its biggest investment in the region this week with the £4.5bn government approval of the Clair field, west of the Shetland Islands. BP and its partners on the project, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, will now enter the second phase of the Clair Ridge project. BP said the investment it was making in this project and three others would be the highest ever investment it has made in the UK North Sea.North Sea production peaked in 1999 at about 6m barrels of oil equivalent per day and the oil majors have in recent years preferred to open up newer oil provinces with more potential. However, Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, is under pressure to demonstrate the company has new growth opportunities in the wake of last year’s Gulf of Mexico spill.There was also some good news for BP in the US after the country’s offshore safety chief, Michael Bromwich, said the company would be allowed to bid on new oil drilling leases in the gulf that will go up for sale this year despite the accident. The voice of support came after the US Interior Department issued its first set of citations related to the spill, accusing BP and its contractors of breaking several rules. The citations could carry significant fines.
223;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-13T19:10:46Z;North Sea oil: cash flow;Approval for BP shows the UK continental shelf still has much to offer;BP rules the waves in the North Sea. Thursday’s announcement that it has been given the go-ahead to develop a new phase of the giant Clair oilfield west of Shetland is a reminder that there is life in the old dog yet (the UK continental shelf, not BP).The £4.5bn Clair Ridge project will take capital investment by oil companies in the North Sea to its highest level – illustrating how valuable mature oilfields have become with oil at more than $100 a barrel. BP, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Shell are spending £10bn on UK offshore projects up to 2015, of which BP accounts for £4bn. With the Clair field having resources estimated at 7bn barrels of oil equivalent, that should keep the company, as operator, pumping high-margin North Sea oil up to 2050. More than half of the capital investment will be spent in the UK. No wonder David Cameron, the prime minister, was in Aberdeen for the news, after the government signed off on Clair.The projects mark a turnround for all four partners, since they had been trimming their North Sea investment and seeing production fall. BP said that the new projects would secure its North Sea output at 200,000 to 250,000 bpd – about 7 per cent of its daily production. And the move shows that complaints that a whopping tax rise on North Sea profits introduced this year would deter investment were unjustified. The tax may yet hinder the plans of small exploration and development companies. But in a world of $110-a-barrel oil, the supermajors can take the hit.The North Sea is meat and drink to BP, and a useful reminder of the company’s heft. Unfortunately, that is not where the company’s strategic dilemma lies. With BP shares stuck at around 400p, trading on a multiple of just 6, a shade below peers, investors’ minds are clearly still focused on the even choppier waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Russia.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
224;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-13T09:08:19Z;BP gets go-ahead for large North Sea project;;BP and its partners have won government approval for a £4.5bn oilfield development in the huge Clair field, marking one of the group’s biggest investments in the UK North Sea that should see oil being produced until at least 2050.The commitment comes just months after the industry launched a stinging attack on the government over its surprise tax hike on North Sea production.Under plans announced on Thursday, BP and its partners – Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – will push ahead with a £4.5bn second-phase investment to develop the Clair field, west of Shetlands.The four companies together plan to invest almost £10bn into four projects that will come onstream over the next five years. BP’s net share of the investment in the projects is about £4bn – the highest level of annual investment made into the UK North Sea by the group.Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, said: “After some years of decline, we now see the potential to maintain our production from the North Sea at around 200,000-250,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day until 2030 . . . And we are working on projects that will take production from some of our largest fields towards 2050.”The commitment comes after warnings from the industry that the increase in the supplementary tax levied on oil and gas production announced in March would deter new investment. “Clearly, the tax regime is part of fiscal planning but these are long-term investment decisions for assets that will produce for some decades,” said BP.The company said more than half the total investment was expected to be spent in the UK and should create about 3,000 jobs.“The story of the North Sea oil industry has a long way yet to run. BP has produced some 5bn barrels of oil and gas equivalent so far from the region and we believe we have the potential for over 3bn more,” said Mr Dudley.One leading investor in BP took the announcement as evidence of a first step towards a more focused approach as the company tries to rebuild after last year’s Gulf of Mexico accident. Shareholders have become increasingly frustrated by the inability to articulate a clear strategy.The company and its partners said that appraisal of an extension to the Clair field confirmed the overall complex had more than 7bn barrels of oil and gas initially in place.Shares in BP, trading below the 650p level struck ahead of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, closed down 6.15p at 405.8p.Additional reporting by Kate Burgess
225;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-12T20:24:34Z;Activists aim to seize moment for change;;Activism by prominent shareholders is on the rise in the US, as beaten-down share prices and a renewed focus on ­streamlining companies give investors an opportunity to push for change at large ­companies.In the first three quarters of the year, there was a 90 per cent rise in the number of companies worth more than $1bn targeted by activist shareholders, according to analysis by JPMorgan’s investment bank.In 2011, companies such as McGraw-Hill, ITT and Yahoo have come under pressure to rethink their business strategy, Clorox was unsuccessfully pushed by Carl Icahn to sell the company, while activists have called for Walmart and News Corp to enhance their corporate governance. Moreover, advisers report a rise in companies seeking advice related to activism since market turbulence picked up over the summer.“It is important for companies to prepare for potential activism,” said Henry Gosebruch, managing director in JPMorgan’s mergers and acquisitions team advising companies on defence strategies.“We have seen a number of funds taking advantage of the recent market volatility to establish positions and to make private approaches to management teams threatening agitation ahead of next year’s proxy windows,” he added.With most companies’ annual meetings slated for the spring, activists must decide whether to launch a proxy fight well ahead of the meeting itself. Such a fight involves activists gaining enough votes – or proxies of other investors – to push through change at a shareholder meeting. But advisers argue that fewer campaigns are resulting in full-blown proxy fights as both activists and their targets take a different tack in their dealings with each other.“More companies are engaging earlier with activists,” said Dusty Philip, co-head of M&A in the Americas at Goldman Sachs. “The overall rise in shareholder democracy over the past decade means that ideas tend to get a more fulsome hearing than in the past.”Of the 38 activist situations at companies worth more than $1bn this year, only 10 developed into proxy fights, of which three were prolonged. Among smaller targets, the drop off in proxy fights is even more pronounced, as both sides try to avoid the costs of a lengthy public battle.While in the credit boom, activist shareholders called for companies to use greater leverage to improve returns to shareholders. Attention earlier this year focused on companies’ cash-heavy balance sheets.But market volatility and a more challenging funding environment has prompted investors to call instead for a rethink of companies’ portfolios.Activists are increasingly lobbying for companies to separate or sell businesses after a raft of spin-offs and splits this year including at Kraft Foods, Tyco and ConocoPhillips.
226;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oil groups chase elusive production growth;;Oil prices have come off their peaks but they remain high. The world’s international companies are awash with cash. Most are ploughing billions of dollars into new projects.At first glance, the oil industry seems to be in rude health. But it is not all good news: in terms of production, one of the key performance measures, many of these companies have been stagnating or have, at best, managed only marginal increases in output so far this year.Third-quarter results, due over the next three weeks, are expected to include production numbers once again showing little or zero growth.ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips of the US are forecast to report a drop in production for the quarter of 1.3 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively compared with the second quarter, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank. Chevron, the country’s second-biggest producer, is expected to show a marginal increase of less than 1 per cent.Similarly, several of Europe’s leading oil producers, such as BP and Eni, are expected to report a drop in output.Analysts at Citigroup predict BP will report a drop of more than 2 per cent from the second to the third quarter as the UK oil group continues to suffer from reduced activity in the Gulf of Mexico after last year’s spill.BP shares came under pressure last week after JPMorgan Cazenove forecast net income for the third quarter of $4.8bn – a year-on-year drop of 17 per cent and a decrease of 14 per cent from the second quarter.One factor in the fall is the continued absence of valuable barrels from the Gulf of Mexico. The decline is expected to increase pressure on Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, to articulate a credible strategy.Meanwhile rival Eni, whose production has been hit by the civil war in Libya, is also expected to record a drop of close to 3 per cent, according to Citigroup. Royal Dutch Shell is expected to report an increase of 1.5 per cent.While the overall picture for the sector has been made more dramatic by the loss of more than 1.3m barrels of oil a day of Libyan production, the trend of anaemic growth is hardly new and points to a long-term challenge for the industry.“The supply outlook for global oil production for the next 12 months is challenging,” said Paul Cheng, senior analyst in the US for BarCap. He expects “very slow growth, if any” from the big companies from 2011 through to 2012-13 “at least”.He highlights two macro trends for the poor performance: a lot of the oil recently discovered has been in difficult and expensive to access areas such as the deep water Gulf of Mexico and west Africa, where the natural development cycle is between six and 10 years.The bulk of these projects will not come onstream until after 2013. In addition, since the downturn in 2008-09, a number of projects in Opec countries have been postponed and, despite the current higher oil prices, will take time to get back on track.Another issue, said Paul Sankey, analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, was that “companies have not been aggressive enough on their oil price assumptions and have therefore underspent instead of being aggressive in their pursuit of growth. They did not plan for sustained $100 per barrel plus Brent.”An analysis of oil production, excluding gas, of some 40 Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development oil companies in the second quarter by Mr Sankey revealed that despite a Brent crude price of about $120 per barrel, the raw average year-on-year decline by OECD oil companies was 12 per cent. Excluding Libya, the decline was 8 per cent.The analysis revealed that only two out of 16 large OECD oil companies – ExxonMobil and Shell – did not show a decline. Both recorded just 1 per cent growth.There is, however, one potential bright spot. In the US, for example, the development and production of tight oil, trapped in rocks, has reversed the decades-long decline in its oil output.Tight oil is growing “at a very rapid pace but we will know more in about five years’ time,” said BarCap’s Mr Cheng. The vital factor for the oil industry would be whether the world will find “similar geological structures outside the US”.
227;COP;Conocophillips;2011-10-10T16:35:26Z;New frontiers: Technology opens far-flung possibilities;Much is happening beyond the confines of Alberta, reports Bernard Simon;While the Alberta oil sands capture most attention, other parts of Canada – the world’s second biggest country – have drawn significant interest from the oil and gas industry.The prairie province of Saskatchewan, adjacent to Alberta, has also been caught up in an oil boom, mostly centred on the Bakken shale formation which straddles Saskatchewan, Alberta and the US states of Montana and North Dakota.Helped by horizontal drilling and other new technology, Bakken production has ballooned from 279,000 barrels in 2004 to 21.4m last year and 10.9m in the first half of 2011According to the province’s energy and resources department, horizontal drilling is set to reach another record this year.Close to 1,600 wells have been in operation this year. The two biggest operators are Crescent Point Energy and PetroBakken Energy, both headquartered in Calgary.Hopes in north-west Saskatchewan have been centred on a 2.7m hectare oil sands deposit across the provincial border from Alberta’s big Athabasca deposit.Calgary-based Oilsands Quest has conducted extensive exploration around Axe Lake with a view to setting up a pilot steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) project as the prelude to a 30,000 b/d commercial operation.Work was suspended in August 2010 while Oilsands Quest sought a deeper-pocketed partner. “We are experiencing the growing pains that are common to smaller oil sands companies with significant opportunities,” it said at the time.It announced a C$60m rights issue this summer, but cancelled it in early September. Instead, it raised a similar amount from the sale of an early-stage oil sands exploration property in Alberta.The deal “will provide us much of the capital we need to complete the Axe Lake pilot [project]”, the company said.Elsewhere, north-eastern British Columbia has become a shale-gas mecca, thanks to hydraulic fracturing technology and generous royalty credits.The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers estimates natural-gas reserves at more than 100 years supply. Shale-gas and coal bed methane make up two-thirds of the total, compensating for an expected decline in conventional reserves.PetroChina signed a tentative $5.4bn partnership with Encana this year to develop a big shale-gas project straddling the British Columbia-Alberta border. Talks broke down in June, apparently over price, and Encana said it would seek new partners.On the other side of the country, the oil industry accounts for more than half of Newfoundland and Labrador’s economic growth over the past two decades.Three Atlantic offshore fields – Hibernia, White Rose and Terra Nova – made up 11 per cent of oil output last year, equal to 276,000 b/d.Production from these fields is gradually declining. But the shortfall could be at least partly made up by extensions to the existing fields as well as a heavy-oil project, known as Hebron, under construction 350km off the coast.A satellite project of Husky Energy’s White Rose field – North Amethyst – came into production last year, with a target output of 37,000 b/d. Hebron, in which ExxonMobil, Chevron and Suncor Energy are the biggest shareholders, is due to come on-stream in 2017 with reserves of 400m to 700m barrels.Suncor and Norway’s Statoil have each announced other promising offshore discoveries. About C$100m has also been spent on on- and offshore exploration wells in western Newfoundland.Oil and gas companies are also eyeing Canada’s vast Arctic region. The Alaska oilfields and discoveries of natural gas around the Mackenzie River delta in the Northwest Territories have raised hopes for years that the Arctic might some day become a hub of oil and gas activity.A snail’s-pace regulatory process, high costs and inadequate infrastructure have so far held back development. But global warming has again piqued interest. The department of aboriginal and northern affairs issued two offshore Arctic oil exploration licences this year to Arctic Energy & Minerals, a little-known company based in the UK. No drilling has yet taken place.The government also handed out 11 licences for onshore exploration in the central valley of the Mackenzie River. ConocoPhillips, Husky Energy, Royal Dutch Shell and Imperial Oil were among the recipients.Development will face protracted scrutiny from regulators and environmental groups, especially in the wake of last year’s Gulf of Mexico oil-spill disaster.The National Energy Board held a public hearing in Inuvik, Northwest Territories, in early September to consider safety and environmental requirements for offshore drilling in the Arctic.In a sign of the obstacles that face Arctic exploration, the Pew Environment Group issued a report that calls for numerous regulatory reforms to protect Arctic waters and the local Inuit population.One important point in dispute is whether to continue a rule dating back to 1976 that requires companies to ensure that they are able to drill a relief well in the same season as a blow-out, thereby preventing a spill continuing all winter before it can be stopped.The industry maintains that such a demand is both impractical and unnecessary. On the other hand, the Pew report concluded that “the same-season relief well policy is the strongest element of Canada’s regulatory regime”.

He is now senior vice-president of Exploration and Production, International.Greg Garland will become chairman and chief executive of the downstream company, focused on refining and marketing. Mr Garland is now senior vice-president of Exploration and Production, Americas.Mr Mulva’s decision to split the upstream and downstream portfolios followed a career spent growing the company through acquisitions that turned ConocoPhillips into one of the world’s five largest oil and gas companies.But by early 2009, the US economic downtown and drastic changes in the global oil and gas industry had exposed the flaws in this strategy. ConocoPhillips disclosed a net loss of $31.8bn in the last quarter of 2008 after a $34bn writedown, together with 1,300 job losses.Competition for hydrocarbon reserves had become intense – with maturing fields, the rise of resource nationalism and tougher competition from national oil companies – making it harder for ConocoPhillips to keep up with its much bigger peers.Mr Mulva thought that the divisions could better compete as separate entities. He set a goal of $17bn in disposals by 2012. And then he decided to spilt the two businesses – a decision Marathon Oil had just made.ConocoPhillips’ new appointments will become effective at the completion of split in the second quarter of 2012. Until then, both men will continue in current roles while directing transition plans and appointing their new executive management teams.
229;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-29T21:21:02Z;Splits and spinoffs of US groups on the rise;;While M&A activity has waned as the year progressed, another corporate strategy has been gathering steam.Splits, spinoffs and demergers have won favour among big US companies– including Kraft Foods, McGraw-Hill and ConocoPhillips – that are seeking to improve their valuation and refocus their business as the economic outlook dims.Most of the separations announced this year are yet to be priced so they are not reflected in the statistics, but two of the top 10 deals included in the figures for the year to September are companies getting smaller. Cargill distributed its holding in Mosaic, the potash company, to shareholders, while Marathon Oil span off its refinery operations.For M&A bankers, however, the rewards from such transactions may be scant compensation for the downturn in plain-vanilla dealmaking.Much of the fees in spinoffs accrue not to deal advisers but to the financiers who determine the capital structure and likely valuation of each resulting entity. One senior banker estimates that advisory fees on a spinoff can be less than a third of a typical sell-side advisory assignment, with far more variability between transactions.But, argue advisers, any diminution in this year’s fee pool should be balanced against the prospective business generated by such transactions.Splits, such as the three-way division of ITT and Tyco, the industrial companies, create multiple new clients for the banks, with the resulting entities widely expected to take part in consolidation or become targets themselves.“After a spin, these newly independent companies are able to revisit their own growth strategies and value-creation opportunities,” notes one banker. “They are often able to pursue them more aggressively than they could in their previous combined form.”
230;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-29T09:14:08Z;Bleak times for US east coast refiners;High crude oil costs are squeezing refining margins;The tight market for light, sweet crude just claimed its latest victim.This week ConocoPhillips, the US oil company, announced it would sell or shut down its 185,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania.The 86-year-old refinery down river from Philadelphia is the latest to face an existential threat from brutal conditions in the Atlantic basin oil markets. Sunoco earlier this month said it will try to unload two nearby refineries, or mothball them if no buyer is found.While Midwest US refiners are enjoying fat profits thanks to discounts on oils linked to the landlocked West Texas Intermediate blend, east coast rivals face a bleak reality.Input costs are high partly due to the Libyan outage across the Atlantic. Refined product markets have become highly competitive, especially for petrol, as Trainer battles with shipments from Europe and the Gulf of Mexico for market share.Trainer mainly runs very low-sulphur crude from Africa and to some degree Canada. The latest publicly available data show the bulk of imports sailed from Nigeria and Angola.Premiums for crude streams such as Nigeria’s Qua Iboe and Bonny Light have surged this year. As Phil Verleger, an independent oil economist, points out, refineries such as Trainer can use this crude to increase production of ultra-low sulphur distillate, a clean-burning fuel increasingly demanded by environmental regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.More than half of Trainer’s output is petrol, however – a distinctly unattractive market at a time when petrol demand on the US east coast is running at the lowest level in almost a decade. “US east coast refining has been under severe market pressure for several years. Product imports, weakness in motor fuel demand and costly regulatory requirements are key factors in creating this very difficult environment,” ConocoPhillips said when it put Trainer on the auction block.If the three refineries on the block shut down, what does this mean for oil markets?For east coast truckers and heating oil consumers – I am the latter, alas – it probably means tighter distillate fuel supplies and higher prices.For Atlantic basin crude markets, however, any shutdowns could ease the squeeze on light, sweet crude supplies.“It’s quite possible that between these three refineries, the situation will reverse and light, sweet crude will move into surplus,” Mr Verleger says.“The real question is what China does. China does from time to time come over and become a big buyer of African crudes. That would leave the Atlantic basin pretty tight.”
231;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-23T16:42:26Z;Company chiefs look to divide and rule;;"Ed Breen, Tyco International chairman and chief executive, was setting out the group’s plans to split. The three new entities would “be able to move faster and more aggressively … by pursuing their own growth strategies as independent companies,” he said.That was back in January 2006. This week, he was offering a similar explanation for the industrial group’s plans to do a further three-way separation.He joins the procession of US executives explaining why they intend to divide their corporate empires.Since mid-July, these companies have included media conglomerate McGraw-Hill; Kraft Foods; and oil group ConocoPhillips which said it would demerge its refining and marketing operation.One reason why demergers are popular is that they often result in a strong share price performance.A wealth of academic research supports this assertion, even though studies may disagree as to the cause – variously citing factors such as more powerful incentives and greater freedom for management teams; higher valuations because equity markets prefer pure play companies; and the premium that comes from the prospect that spin-offs can more readily be taken over.The US tax regime has long meant that a properly-structured spin-off can be a tax-free way to streamline a group. But additional factors lie behind the fashion for splits.Some people see the financial crisis of 2008-09 as a prompt. Bill Huyett, a partner at consulting firm McKinsey, says it “triggered a more fundamental look by corporate boards at what businesses they owned and why they owned them”.Joe Cornell, who runs Spin-Off Advisors, believes the crisis had an effect. “When the market collapsed, there were a lot of spin-offs that had not yet been announced that were shelved then and are coming through now”.Another reason sometimes cited is the difficulty of running a widely diversified group at a time when creating value in conglomerates must go beyond generic tools such as budgeting and cost-cutting.“Now you need more sector-specific ways to create value, and it’s difficult for a single management team, no matter how able it is, to stay current and go deep on the talent and technology that affect businesses in every sector of the economy,” Mr Huyett says.Some companies have been encouraged to look at spin-offs because turbulent markets for initial public offerings and limited lists of prospective buyers make those options less attractive.Yet advisers believe there are more positive reasons to adopt this approach to slimming a business, pointing out that the high level of cash on corporate balance sheets means companies are less likely to need the money that would be raised by a sale or partial IPO.“The spins we have seen this year are not generally being done for defensive reasons,” says Carsten Stendevad, head of the financial strategy group at Citigroup’s investment bank. “It is a proactive strategic choice.”At the same time, depressed stock prices encourage companies to seek ways to persuade equity markets that they merit a fresh appraisal.“When a board is grappling with a macroeconomic environment where growth is tepid, there are not a lot of possible catalysts for a company’s valuation,” Mr Stendevad says. “Now is a time when revealing a business line’s high-growth prospects is likely to be rewarded.The US spin-off momentum comes partly from the success of activist investors, who are seen to have played a role in, for example, Fortune Brands’ decision to split.This is one reason why the vogue for spin-offs is not reflected at European companies. “Compared with their US counterparts, activist shareholders in Europe have generally had a tougher time,” says Daniel Stillit, special situations analyst at UBS.He also points out that the record of spin-offs in Europe has not been encouraging of late. “The most recent large-scale demerger, of PostNL and TNT Express in May, was the result of shareholder activism,” he says “That hasn’t, so far, been a resounding success for shareholders.”Of course outperformance is not guaranteed. In the UK, three profit warnings and the abrupt exit of chief executive Jim Marsh from Cable & Wireless Worldwide – which demerged from Cable & Wireless plc in March 2010 – scarcely act as an advertisement for separation.Still, the relatively low number of high-profile casualties from spin-offs gives the approach wide appeal. Some advisers believe that General Electric, the standard-bearer for conglomerates, could come under pressure to split off its financial unit. Others see Johnson Controls, which combines automotive interiors with a heating and air-conditioning division, as another candidate for separation.In the UK, analysts say BP could consider a split of its operations as a way to increase value.Tyco may be the latest to announce a spin-off so far this year: it is unlikely to be the last."
232;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-22T16:35:39Z;Venezuela ready to pay Exxon only $1bn;;Venezuela will pay ExxonMobil $1bn in compensation for assets nationalised in 2007, far less than the $6bn the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalisation is seeking through international arbitration, according to government officials.Rafael Ramírez, energy minister, also cast doubt on whether Venezuela would respect rulings issued by international courts, with decisions expected this year in New York’s International Chamber of Commerce and the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.“We are not willing to pay the abusive sum that this transnational is trying to make the sovereign people pay,” said Mr Ramirez in a statement late on Wednesday.He was referring to Exxon’s demands for compensation after President Hugo Chávez ordered the seizure of several extra-heavy crude projects in the Orinoco Belt, where the recent certification of vast oil deposits led Opec to rank Venezuela as holding the largest oil reserves in the world.According to statements to Reuters, Mr Ramirez is proposing to pay $1bn for Exxon’s assets. He underlined that PDVSA, the state oil company, was not negotiating with the US oil company outside New York’s International Chamber of Commerce, which is expected to issue a ruling on the case soon.ExxonMobil declined to comment.Venezuela is facing about 20 international arbitration cases after a wave of nationalisations across “strategic” sectors of the economy, including energy, metals, cement, food and utilities.The Opec nation could be asked to pay out as much as $40bn. That would place heavy strain on public finances as Mr Chávez, who has just completed his fourth round of chemotherapy in Cuba, begins campaigning for presidential elections due in October 2012.Mr Ramirez, who is also president of PDVSA, appeared to contradict statements earlier on Wednesday by Carlos Escarrá, Venezuela’s prosecutor-general, suggesting that Venezuela would accept decisions arising from international arbitration.“They were asking for $20bn,” said Mr Escarra, referring to Exxon’s original demands. “Suddenly that dropped to around $12bn, and now – imagine what bandits – they want $6bn. Venezuela has to pay for the expropriations, we are clear on that … The problem now is how much we will pay.”Earlier this year, Mr Ramirez said PDVSA had made an allowance of $2.5bn to cover the arbitration payments due to Exxon and ConocoPhillips, whose assets were taken over at the same time but are thought to be worth around twice as much as Exxon’s.“We are concerned about the reaction by the authorities if the compensation amounts finally awarded to both oil companies are much higher than what they have presented as ‘maximum’ figures to be paid by the republic,” Boris Segura, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said.“Coupled with the recent announcement of the repatriation of gold holdings and the move of international reserves out of the US and Europe, this confusion about the arbitration claims does not look positive for Venezuela’s willingness to pay,” said Mr Segura, referring to Venezuela’s debt.Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty
233;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-19T19:16:43Z;Lost in the sands;Effort to revive Libya’s oil industry will have global consequences;"The first thing Jamid Ahmad did on returning to the Zelten oilfield was to check on the well known as C-1. The 27-year-old mechanic last saw it in February, when he and fellow workers fled the National Oil Company-owned desert facility 450km south-west of Benghazi in the early days of uprising against Colonel Muammer Gaddafi.Following several months during which the abandoned field was controlled by troops loyal to the dictator, Mr Ahmad found the well partially covered in sand but otherwise apparently intact. “This is not just about oil,” he says, his relief evident as he checks that the valves remain as firmly closed as he left them. “This is about the history of Libya.”The C-1 well commands a special place in Libya’s oil industry. It was the country’s first well to pump oil in commercial quantities when production started in September 1961, with output of 20,000 barrels a day. Fifty years later, almost to the day, a pressure gauge at the top of the well reads little more than zero. But the apparent lack of damage suggests Zelten should be able to restart production soon.The story is different elsewhere. Nearby fields as well as Libya’s main export terminals on the southern Mediterranean shores – all visited by the Financial Times this month – showed visible signs of damage, likely to take months to fix. Even in Zelten, the accommodation complex lies ransacked and electricity remains off, hampering the return of workers.Mr Ahmad himself, having checked his room and found that the Gaddafi army took the few valuables he left behind, went home again. His return is crucial not just for the north Africa nation, for which oil revenues are the only significant source of income. They are also significant for the global economy, as higher Libyan production would push oil prices down; and for an energy industry always in search of fresh crude reserves.The revolution has delivered a big setback for the country’s oil industry. It will take months, if not years, to recover to pre-war levels. But in the medium term, the end of the Gaddafi regime also provides an opportunity. Libya has for years punched below its potential, hampered by lack of investment as its leader diverted funds for other causes and his personal use; sanctions preventing the return of US companies; and an exodus of engineers to other countries in the region. But executives and officials believe the country, which boasts Africa’s largest reserves, could produce much more oil in the next two decades if the new ruling class pursues the right policies. In 1969, the year Gaddafi gained power, Libya produced nearly as much as Saudi Arabia – 3.1m b/d and 3.3m b/d, respectively – a clear sign of its potential.The Libyan revolution has rewritten the who’s who of its oil industry. For years Shokri Ghanem, the Gaddafi-era prime minister who became head of the National Oil Company, controlled all the sector’s levers. But since his defection in May, and the rebels’ victory in Tripoli in August, new figures have taken charge.The most prominent is Ali Tarhouni, the finance, economy and oil minister in waiting. The former economics professor, returning from a long exile, has little experience in the energy industry and insiders say he is likely to relinquish his nominal control to Abdel Rahman bin Yezza in a reshuffle. Ahmed Omar Shakmak – based in the eastern city of Benghazi, previously the rebels’ stronghold – is deputy oil minister and the senior official receiving most visiting industry executives. Two weeks ago, it was Italy’s Eni; last week, Repsol YPF of Spain.Nuri Berruien, newly-elected chairman of the National Oil Company, is the most senior official in charge of producing, refining and exporting the black stuff. The 65-year-old petroleum engineer was about to retire, just before the start of the revolution six months ago, from a senior position at the Arab Gulf Oil Company (Agoco), an NOC subsidiary, but is now busier than ever trying to restart Libya’s oil industry. He, too, is based in Benghazi, although NOC headquarters were in Tripoli before the revolution.Under Ahmed Majbri, the newly- appointed chairman (previously employed in the company’s finance department), Agoco has already started production at Sarir and Messla. Both of the country’s easternmost oilfields fell under rebel control in the early days of the revolution.As a member of the ruling National Transitional Council’s oversight committees for finance, economy and oil, Mustafa el-Huni is another official crucial to the oil industry. Although there are four others on the committee, he is seen to be in charge of oil affairs. He was vice-chairman of the National Oil Company in the 1980s, and observers say he could play a central role in shaping Libya’s long-term energy policy. He has already spoken in favour of splitting the NOC into two or three companies and devoting more attention to the development of the natural gas industry.Libyan oil is far more important for the global economy and the oil industry than appears at first glance. Before the uprising began, it supplied about 1.6m b/d – a mere two per cent of global output, roughly the same as Italy’s consumption, according to the International Energy Agency, the western countries’ oil watchdog. But the headline figure is deceptive. Libya produces a particularly high-quality crude, sought after by western refiners for its low sulphur content, which helps meet strict new environmental rules for petrol and diesel. Precise figures are hard to come by, but industry executives estimate that the country is one of the leading producers of low-sulphur oil, accounting for roughly 10-15 per cent of global output. Moreover, Libya’s proximity to Europe reduces transport costs.As Libyan production dried up, refiners raced to find high-quality alternatives, driving up prices. Brent, which is a global benchmark, surged to a two-year high of $127.02 a barrel in early April. That, in turn, has contributed to higher inflation, which has pushed monetary authorities, including the European Central Bank, to raise interest rates.The disruption to supply caused by the war forced an extraordinary response from Saudi Arabia, which raised its production to nearly 10m b/d, the highest in 30 years. However, Saudi crude is medium-quality oil so, while the kingdom was able to cover the volume lost, it was unable to bridge the quality gap. As the market for high-quality oil continued to tighten, driving up prices, the IEA ordered the release of members’ strategic reserves – only the third time it has done so.Coupled with a slowdown in global oil demand growth, and the effect of the IEA’s mandated release of strategic stocks, the anticipated return of Libya to the oil market is exerting downward pressure on prices. Brent has fallen to $110 a barrel. But hopes could be getting ahead of the reality on the ground. The country is producing only about 160,000 b/d from its easternmost fields, Sarir and Messla, of which only about 100,000 b/d would be exported – less than one-tenth of prewar levels.However, Nuri Berruien, the new chairman of the National Oil Company, says flows could reach the critical 1m b/d level in about six months. And, he adds, “in 15 months we can reach the prewar level of 1.6m b/d”.The pace of the industry’s reconstruction is crucial to the global oil market and, by extension, the global economy. Some of the leading companies rely heavily on Libya – among them, Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, Total of France, OMV of Austria, Wintershall of Germany, and US-based Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Hess and Marathon. Eni and Repsol, the largest investors in the country, have already sent senior executives to Benghazi, the eastern stronghold of the former rebels, to discuss their return.Yet some of their number say security fears threaten a speedy return. “Safety is paramount to the big international companies and it would take time for them to feel the country is OK,” says Anders Nilsson, Benghazi-based head of Condrill, a Swedish drilling company. Today, while there is a consensus that bringing Libya back on tap will be tough, interviews in Benghazi reveal disagreement among the new oil establishment emerging from the rebel ranks, executives and diplomats about how long that process will take.The most immediate challenge is not war damage but looting. When Gaddafi loyalists fled some of the largest oilfields and terminals, they took all they could: cars, trucks, power generators, pumps and other equipment. Local gangs – and rebels in some cases – took whatever remained. Besides requiring considerable new investment, this has created a further problem: logistics. Oil workers need food and sleeping quarters in often remote desert facilities. They have neither.Then there is the damage that is not immediately visible. Officials may be relieved to see light or no surface damage in fields such as Zelten; but they worry about possible, as yet undetected, problems underground. Oil wells need constant maintenance and, after six months of stoppage, facilities hundreds of meters below the sands, could have suffered lasting damage. “Electrical submersible pumps that sit at the bottom of wells deep underground must be lifted to the surface and cleaned regularly, which is especially important in Libyan wells, given the waxier nature of the crude there,” says Ed Morse of Citigroup. In the worst case scenario, companies would have to redrill the wells, says Yousif Al Gheriani, head of the 17th February Committee for oil and gas, which groups workers in eastern Libya.Another problem is the oil reservoirs themselves, above all in the most mature fields of the Sirte basin, near Col Gaddafi’s home town – still the scene of violent conflict – which had been pumping since the 1960s. To force the crude oil out of the reservoirs, engineers maintain pressure by injecting them with water or natural gas. After six months of stoppage, the first task for the arriving crews will not be to start production but to re-establish pressure.But Libya’s output is almost worthless if it cannot be exported to the global market. And officials are discovering that some of their ports have fared worse than the oilfields. Libya has six main terminals, of which at least two – Es Sider and Marsa el Brega – are heavily damaged.All these factors could slow Libya’s return to the international market. Given time, the country has the potential to rebuild the industry and exceed former production levels. But years of US-imposed sanctions, plus Col Gaddafi’s refusal to invest in the NOC, means it pumps less than African nations with a smaller geological endowment. Officials say the NOC’s old target of increasing production to 2m b/d by about 2015 is no longer on the table.Industry executives say Libya is not as big a prize as Iraq. There, oil companies – from New York-listed ExxonMobil to Chinese state-owned enterprises – have fought hard to win contracts to develop the industry and boost production from about 2.8m b/d to as much as 6m b/d by 2020. But they acknowledge that the African country has the potential to as much as double its production in the next two decades. Ross Cassidy of the Wood Mackenzie consultancy says today’s leadership “may take Libya into a new era where its natural resources are used more effectively for the benefit of the broader population”, seeking investments to achieve its full production potential of about 3m b/d. For that, it would need to open up fully to international companies with the financial and technical expertise to recover more from mature oilfields.The big prize could lie, however, in another hydrocarbon: natural gas. Libya has been slow in developing its gas industry, particularly when compared with neighbouring Algeria. In 1971, it became the second country – after Algeria – to export supercooled liquefied natural gas using tankers. But the development of the industry has been slow – again partly because of US sanctions, but also because of Col Gaddafi’s lack of interest. Exports, nonetheless, have grown significantly in the last few years, since the opening of the Greenstream underwater pipeline to Italy. Still, Libya exported just 349bn cubic feet of natural gas in 2010; the figure for Algeria was more than 2,000bn cu ft. “Gas was fully ignored during the Gaddafi’s years,” says Mustafa el-Huni, the National Transitional Council member in charge of energy affairs. That will now change, he says. Again, international expertise will be required to build – and finance – the costly plants to export the product.However, much of the future of Libya’s hydrocarbon industry will depend on people such as Mr Ahmad. Looking out over the desert at Zelten, opening his arms as if to embrace the dozens of oil wells scattered across a vast landscape of rolling dunes, he says: “Look at this. Gaddafi used to own it. This is now ours. We will work hard for it.”"
234;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Tyco: break-up is a good bet;With its proved track-record and industrial logic, this split makes sense;Dennis Kozlowski – now sitting in a federal prison cell – hated the word “conglomerate”, preferring to dub Tyco a “multi-industrial company”. Whatever one calls it, investors have had nearly as much disdain for the corporate structure he created as they did for Mr Kozlowski. Its successor entity just announced the second three-way split in five years.Both in its furious construction and serial deconstruction, Tyco strongly resembles ITT. Built up in the 1960s by Harold Geneen, the king of the “conglomerateurs”, ITT split into three back in 1995 with the group that kept the old corporate name proposing yet another three-way split earlier this year. The similarities do not stop there. Just as ITT created ample shareholder value in its first split and made a sound case for doing so second time round, Tyco apparently has the benefit of the doubt, outperforming a weak US market by 5 per cent on Monday.Tyco’s ADT residential security business will be freed up to pursue further consolidation in a fragmented field. And, though management was coy on the matter, the two remaining businesses, flow control and commercial fire and security, will become small and distinct enough to attract takeover bids. Failing that, it should gain the focus and discipline of a spin-off.It is easy to be cynical about corporate combinations and splits. As one goes into fashion and the other goes out, the only constant is fat banking fees. With McGraw-Hill, Kraft and ConocoPhillips already blazing a trail this year though, Tyco is not merely jumping on the bandwagon. Management said it began thinking about this split soon after the last one.Of course, today’s “small is beautiful” trend will produce results ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime. With its proved track-record and industrial logic, bet on Tyco being the latter.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
235;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
236;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-15T16:26:14Z;US energy groups act on natural gas demand;;US energy companies are converting rigs and trucks to run on natural gas, building fuelling stations and launching educational campaigns to increase demand for the domestic fuel that has flooded the market on the back of the shale boom.With technological advances enabling gas production from shale rock, estimates of US supplies of natural gas have risen from 30 to 100 years’ worth, at current usage rates, with the US market now oversupplied.Prices have been hovering at about $4 per million British thermal units, down sharply from 2008’s record of $13.69 per mBtu, and the industry believes they could remain at that level for several years.To jump-start demand, Chesapeake Energy, the second-biggest natural gas producer in the US, is converting 100 of its own rigs, all its hydraulic fracturing equipment and almost 5,000 of its fleet vehicles to run on natural gas.Taylor Shinn, Chesapeake’s senior director of corporate development, said the company was not going to stand by and wait for US demand to catch up with supply.“This is not a technology problem,” Mr Shinn said. “We’re not waiting on an enhanced battery to make this product viable as a transportation fuel. What we’re waiting on is for economies of scale to develop.”Chesapeake has pledged to redirect about 1-2 per cent of its forecast annual drilling budget away from efforts to increase natural gas supply towards projects to stimulate natural gas demand. Over the next 10 years, Chesapeake expects to commit $1bn towards investments to build crucial fuelling infrastructure and bringing gas-to-liquids fuels to market.Chesapeake said converting the company’s medium and light-duty trucks to natural gas would reduce fuel costs by up to $20m a year. Converting drilling rigs and fracturing equipment would cut diesel fuel consumption by about 350,000 gallons a day, saving the company about $230m annually.“The market needs a catalyst,” Mr Shinn said. “We felt it was a critical time for us to step up and provide that leadership for the benefit of our company and our country.”ConocoPhillips also this week launched a campaign to promote the use of natural gas – now 40 per cent of its production – and a nationwide educational campaign.Jim Mulva, ConocoPhillips’ chief executive, said using the country’s natural gas should be a very important part of US energy policy.“It’s a big job creator,” Mr Mulva said. He noted that natural gas sustains 2.8m US jobs, directly and indirectly, with gas being extracted from shale fields in at least 15 states, including New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania – key election states.“We believe that as the US enters the election campaign season, energy policy will be a key point of debate,” he said. “Hopefully, the debate will centre on using energy development, particularly of natural gas, to drive job creation.”Other companies are installing natural gas fuelling stations across the country. US Steel, for example, has one for its vehicles, including a natural-gas fuelled tractor, at a plant in Pennsylvania. The industry notes that such companies can save as much as $2 a gallon compared with diesel.
237;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-09T19:01:42Z;Greens MP points to energy department ties;;The energy department’s close ties with energy companies, lobbyists and advisers have been highlighted by new figures showing it has appointed dozens of private sector employees on secondment since it was established three years ago.Thirty such staff have worked at the Department of Energy and Climate Change while being employed by another organisation. A handful have come from other government departments, quangos and academic institutions. Some on secondment are taxpayer-funded, but many continue to be paid by their original organisation.The information, obtained by Caroline Lucas, the Green Party leader, shows that some of the world’s biggest energy companies, including ConocoPhillips, EDF and National Grid, have had staff members working within the department, often for more than a year.Those numbers have increased since the coalition government came to power last year, with many appointed in the run-up to Chris Huhne’s proposals to reform the electricity market, which will have a major impact on the companies involved.Ms Lucas told the Financial Times: “One would imagine these companies are getting something for their money, whether that’s influence or policy changes. EDF’s involvement shows energy policy is being rigged to benefit nuclear power.”A spokesman for the department stressed those on secondment came from a variety of companies, adding: “DECC uses secondees from outside the civil service where they can provide particular skills, expertise and experience that the department needs.”Ms Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, was speaking at her party’s annual conference in Sheffield where she launched a fierce critique of the coalition, and urged disenchanted Liberal Democrat voters to join the Greens instead.She branded Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister, “the minister for meeting angry people and getting shouted at”, and urged those who voted for him at the last election: “If you became involved in politics to serve your local community, to protect the environment or to challenge inequality, then join us.”She also accused Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, of pandering to the nuclear industry by proposing a floor price for carbon, which will benefit nuclear energy providers more than any other sector. But she also feels Mr Huhne, who has been attacked by many in the Conservatives for being too pro-green, has been railroaded by other departments in many of his decisions, such as the scaling back of solar subsidies.With her party’s support remaining in the low single figures, Ms Lucas admitted she had not yet achieved a significant breakthrough with Lib Dem voters, but insisted that the increased exposure of having a Westminster MP would eventually make that happen.But she said she had worked more constructively with her Labour counterparts. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, had been “far more sympathetic to discussions with us than any of the previous Labour leaders”. Although she ruled out a formal merger between the two parties, she said she would welcome talks on how they could work together regularly.Ms Lucas also said politicians of all parties had made knee-jerk responses to the riots, accusing David Cameron of wanting to create “ghettos, where the undeserving poor can be kept and contained through heavy policing, CCTV surveillance, and the use of benefits as a stick to intimidate”.
238;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-07T16:49:37Z;China calls for new probe on oil spill;;"Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, has called for a fresh probe into the offshore oil spill at Penglai 19-3, the clearest sign yet of Beijing’s displeasure over the incident that has forced ConocoPhillips to shut down its largest oilfield in China.The remarks from China’s cabinet underscore how the spill, though small in size, has caught the attention of top leaders at a time when environmental concerns are rising. For decades China’s economic boom has been accompanied by growing pollution, but this year officials have warned environmental degradation was a “bottleneck” for economic growth.Earlier on Wednesday ConocoPhillips, the operator of Penglai 19-3, issued an unusual apology in a bid to smooth relations with Beijing.“ConocoPhillips deeply regrets these incidents and apologises for the impact that the incidents have had on the Chinese people and the environment,” said James Mulva, chairman.ConocoPhillips would also set up a fund to address its “responsibilities” under Chinese law, the company said, without specifying how big the fund would be.Hinting at possible legal battles to come, the State Council, or cabinet, urged that the legal rights of people affected by the spill be fully upheld. Analysts and industry executives have raised concerns over whether ConocoPhillips is being singled out by regulators for unusually harsh discipline because it is a foreign company.ConocoPhillips has a 49 per cent stake in the field and Cnooc, China’s offshore oil and gas company, has a 51 per cent stake.After months of cleanup efforts, Chinese regulators ordered ConocoPhillips on Friday to shut down production at all seven drilling platforms of Penglai 19-3 and said the spills were caused by “negligence”. The regulators say that ConocoPhillips failed to meet an August 31 deadline to clean up the spill and prevent new leaks; ConocoPhillips says it complied with those orders in full.The State Council said on Wednesday that the risk of further spills at Penglai 19-3 had not yet been eliminated, and called for tighter environmental controls in Bohai Bay, including tougher controls on petrochemical projects in the area.Like the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico last year, the spills at Penglai 19-3 seem poised to have a profound impact on China’s offshore oil and gas industry. However, the incidents are magnitudes apart in terms of scale: Deepwater Horizon released 4.9m barrels of oil into the sea, over a thousand times more than the Penglai spill, which leaked 3,200 barrels of oil and drilling mud."
239;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-07T16:39:57Z;Shell plans to expand Vietnam business;;Royal Dutch Shell is keen to expand its upstream and downstream business in Vietnam at a time when other oil majors such as BP and ConocoPhillips have been pulling out amid frustrations over bureaucracy and concern about the worsening territorial dispute in the South China Sea.Thanh Le, Shell’s general manager in Vietnam, told the Financial Times that, outside of China and India, Vietnam was one of the most attractive markets in Asia, with energy demand set to grow strongly as the country’s economic transformation continues.“With a young and growing population of 88m, we see potential for the future and believe Shell can add a lot of value in Vietnam,” he said.Mr Thanh revealed Shell was eyeing a number of opportunities, including helping Vietnam build its first liquefied natural gas terminal and potentially bidding for new oil exploration licences.The Anglo-Dutch company hopes to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Vietnamese government in the coming months, which would lay out the framework for closer co-operation in areas such as LNG, he said.Mr Thanh added that Shell had been in talks about acquiring a 25-30 per cent stake in Petec, a fuel importer and distributor controlled by state-owned PetroVietnam, until the government finally decided in July that it did not want to open such a strategic sector to foreign investors.He said he was “disappointed” by the decision as the acquisition would have given Shell a foothold in Vietnam’s fast-growing fuel retail business.Most Vietnamese fuel distributors have been losing money in the past few years because the government has the kept pump prices down in order to win public support. Mr Thanh said this pattern was likely to continue in the next few years but that, over the next 10-15 years, the country would eventually move to market pricing.Well over a decade after Shell ended its last drilling programme in Vietnam, with hundreds of millions spent in the mid 1990s and no commercial discoveries, the company is also considering bidding for new offshore exploration licences that have been put out to tender by PetroVietnam.“We haven’t found the right opportunities yet but our technical team is still working on it,” Mr Thanh said.Vietnam has 4.4bn barrels of proven oil reserves, a similar level to that of Australia, Egypt and Indonesia, and last year produced 370,000 barrels a day, equivalent to 0.5 per cent of global market share, according to BP statistics.Rivals BP and ConocoPhillips both decided to sell their upstream assets in Vietnam in the past year as part of their global divestment programmes.Foreign oil executives say Vietnam is a difficult place to invest because of the endemic bureaucracy and slow decision-making process at PetroVietnam and the worsening territorial dispute between China, Vietnam, the Philippines and other nations over the resource-rich South China Sea. Mr Thanh said Shell was monitoring the situation in the South China Sea “very carefully”.
240;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Long road to recovery for seared and twisted pipes;;"Work stopped suddenly at the Es Sider oil terminal.A dust-covered fax dated February 18 sits on the desk of the “oil movement supervisor”, where it was hurriedly left as workers fled Colonel Muammer Gaddafi’s advancing troops. “This is to inform you that the Es Sider lifting programme for the month of March 2011 will be as follows,” the fax states, detailing the arrival dates of tankers chartered by, among others, US companies ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Amerada Hess.The tankers never docked at the port, a consequence of the Libyan oil industry’s descent into chaos after the revolution against Col Gaddafi began on February 17.Six months later, as the Financial Times toured the heavily damaged facility, a handful of rebel soldiers was guarding the mangled skeletons of melted pipelines, burnt equipment and looted buildings.“When Gaddafi’s forces started to withdraw, they hit the terminal with rocket-propelled grenades,” said Mentham Said, a 37-year-old rebel soldier.Es Sider, and its sister cities of Marsa el-Brega and Ras Lanuf, are at the centre of the Libyan oil industry and are home to the country’s largest refineries and export terminals.The three strategic oil towns lie along a coastal strip that has seen some of the fiercest fighting during the conflict to overthrow Col Gaddafi, changing hands between rebels and regime forces several times.Even today, the front line lies just 75km to the west, where opposition fighters are massing outside Sirte, Col Gaddafi’s birthplace.The combat has left the towns scattered with landmines and scarred with burnt oil tanks, ruptured pipelines and looted residential complexes – all of which will hamper the recovery of the Libyan oil industry over the next year, officials and experts say.The damage is greatest at Es Sider, the largest terminal in Libya and the most crucial to the rebuilding of the oil industry. According to the International Energy Agency, the terminal exported 341,000 b/d last year, more than a quarter of the country’s total sales of 1.27m b/d.At the port, three of 16 crude storage tanks, are still burning and others are damaged, while at the terminal itself the metering station and key pipeline junctions were blown up, with thick steel pipelines ripped open like food cans. The resulting fire reached temperatures that melted metal and concrete.The control room has been looted, as well as many other offices and warehouses. Computers lie on the floor broken; filing cabinets are empty.About 8km to the west, the petrochemical complex of Ras Lanuf fared better.The refinery, the country’s largest, with a capacity of 220,000 b/d, is largely intact, although two large kerosene tanks were burnt down after being hit by shells.Several warehouses were looted, too, and at least one control room was sabotaged.Despite the damage, workers are slowly returning. “I’m dying, waiting for the moment I can start the pumps,” said Anwar Ali, chief supervisor at the refinery.“They made such a nice noise,” he added, as proud of the cogs that power Ras Lanuf as a father would be of his children.Yet Mr Ali acknowledged it would take time for the facility to function again.The refinery has no power supply, and the residential complex that houses employees’ families has been ransacked, with some houses destroyed. Even the interior of the workers’ mosque is riddled with bullet holes. The terminal and small refinery at Marsa el Brega, about 48km east of Ras Lanuf, are also badly damaged from the fighting.But the destruction is less of a concern than the estimated 10,500 mines laid by Col Gaddafi’s troops, Benghazi-based oil officials and security experts say.“Gaddafi had some nasty landmines of Chinese origin which are difficult to detect. It will take time to remove them all,” said a western security expert in Benghazi.The other challenge is to secure the three oil towns fully. Although the rebels retook them more than 10 days ago, their grip is still thin. A brigade of about 200 men has been formed to protect Ras Lanuf with equipment donated by Qatar.But Es Sider and Marsa El Brega remain largely unprotected, with only a few soldiers of the ragtag rebel army standing guard."
241;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oil spill raises concerns for groups in China;;An oil spill off the coast of China at a field operated by ConocoPhillips has sparked concerns about discrimination against foreign companies and underscored how Chinese regulators are becoming stricter on pollution.China, the world’s biggest consumer of energy, has ambitious plans to develop offshore oil and gas, particularly in the challenging but gas-rich terrain of the South China Sea.But China’s first publicly disclosed spill from an offshore oil rig, in Bohai off the northern coast, has been met with a harsh response from regulators that many believe signals a new era of tightening regulations for offshore drilling in China.For the past two decades foreign groups have played a crucial role in developing offshore resources alongside Cnooc, China’s offshore producer, as the Chinese company gradually acquired the technology to conduct offshore drilling itself. Apart from Conoco, Anadarko, BP and Husky Energy have all been involved in offshore oil and gas exploration in China.However, the oil spill this summer at the Penglai 19-3 block, co-owned by Conoco and Cnooc and operated by Conoco, has highlighted the risks that foreign companies face when they are operating in sectors – such as offshore drilling – that become a focus for environmental crackdown.Conoco estimates that 700 barrels of oil and 2,500 barrels of drilling mud were released into the ocean during a series of incidents that began on June 4. Chinese media reports that new leaks continue to be found seeping from the ocean floor, but ConocoPhillips says that less than one barrel of oil has been leaked into the ocean since June 19 and most leaks have been contained.In the months since the leak occurred, Chinese regulators – who waited several weeks to disclose the spill to the public – have gradually escalated their criticisms of Conoco, accusing the company of “negligence” and saying they are preparing a lawsuit over the environmental degradation caused by the spill. Most recently, regulators last week ordered a shutdown of all seven drilling platforms at the Penglai 19-3 block.Analysts say the order was unusually harsh because only two of the seven platforms had reported leaks, and those two had been shut down since July. Production will not be restarted until a new development plan for the block is submitted by Conoco and approved.“ConocoPhillips believes we have been and will continue to be a prudent operator of the Peng Lai field,’’ the company said on Sunday.China’s maritime regulators have “thrown the book at ConocoPhillips,” says Laban Yu, energy analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank. “They are going to make an example out of them,” he adds. “They are saying foreign companies have problems just like our own.”The field – which is one of the largest in China, accounting for about 4 per cent of Cnooc’s production and 3 per cent of Conoco’s production – could remain idle for as long as six months, analysts say, though regulators have not specified any time frame. China is the world’s fifth-biggest producer of crude oil.“There are tiny spills like this that go on all the time and never get reported,” says one analyst who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject. Last year one large spill in Dalian at a refinery co-owned by CNPC released hundred of thousands of barrels of oil into the ocean, but went largely unpunished with no companies reported being fined or sued over the incident.However, others point out that the response from maritime authorities fits into a pattern of increasing environmental concerns and tighter regulation.“All developing countries go through a process of paying more and more attention to the environment,” says Lin Boqiang, professor of energy economics at Xiamen University. Mr Lin rejects any comparison between the Bohai spill and the Dalian spill last year. “The laws and regulations for environmental protection are constantly getting stronger, so you can’t compare a spill that happens today to something that happened a year ago.”Cnooc share prices in Hong Kong are down 12 per cent this week from their Friday close.Conoco says the company has complied with the regulator’s orders and that an expert review of the plan to reduce reservoir pressure was set to begin on Tuesday. Operations have stopped at all 180 producing wells on the Penglai 19-3 block, according to the company’s website.
242;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-05T16:07:53Z;Colossal task ahead for Libya’s new oil chief;;Six months ago Nuri Berruien was anticipating his retirement from one of the subsidiaries of Libya’s National Oil Company. But the start of the civil-war put paid to his plans.Now the 65-year old petroleum engineer is busier than ever as the newly appointed chairman of the state-owned NOC.“I have a national duty,” he says at the company’s small offices in Benghazi – for months the rebels’ stronghold. Its Tripoli headquarters are not yet considered safe. “The oil industry before the revolution was operated under the worst bureaucratic and corrupted regime.”Mr Berruien’s task is colossal. Before the war, Libya pumped 1.6m barrels a day of high quality crude oil, sought after by European refiners because of its low sulphur content. Now output has fallen to zero.The fall of Muammer Gaddafi’s regime after 42 years could see Libya producing 100,000-300,000 b/d in the next couple of months, from fields in the east – under rebel control since the start of the civil war – and offshore fields in the Mediterranean. But ramping up output to pre-crisis levels will take more than a year under the most optimistic scenario, Mr Berruien acknowledges.The first task for Mr Berruien and his team is to improve security enough to get thousands of workers, scattered across Libya, back to their jobs in remote areas of the country’s oil-rich desert. Even today, after the fall of Tripoli, skirmishes continue in oil areas in the west, and some oilfields are mined.The workers’ return will also be hampered by extensive looting at desert compounds. Vehicles, for example, have been taken away by gangs or used by Col Gaddafi’s army.“We have started to clear the mines. But it will take time,” says Mr Berruien.Lars Nylin, head of Countermine, a company that specialises in landmines removal and is already in Benghazi, says it could take up to 18 months to clear mines and booby traps laid by Col Gaddafi’s forces around the country’s oil infrastructure.However, Mr Berruien says local staff are willing to live for a while in the desert in precarious tent camps until construction companies can rebuild their compounds and supplies – from air conditioners to television sets – arrive.When workers return, they will need to check more than 2,000 oil wells, some deep in the Sahara desert more than 1,000km from the coastline. Even if the wells appear intact, six months of inactivity could have damaged them. “We know that some of the wells will come back [into production] and others will be dead,” Mr Berruien says.He is particularly worried about the wells with submerged pumps, used in the most mature fields such as those of the Sirte basin, which accounts for two-thirds of the country’s production. “We know many pumps will fail,” he says. In those cases, NOC will have to drill new wells, which will mean waiting until spare parts arrive and, most likely, will require the help of foreign contractors yet to return to Libya.“The next step is to build up production, but that will require foreign oil companies’ support,” he says, referring to previous joint ventures between NOC and companies including Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, Total of France, OMV of Austria, Wintershall of Germany, and US-based Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Amereda Hess and Marathon.But simply rehabilitating the oilfields would not put Libya back into the global oil market. Pipelines and oil export terminals are another – and bigger – problem. Col Gaddafi’s forces mined a key pipeline hub connecting some of the country’s biggest oilfields with the terminals of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, the most important. And the oil terminals themselves have suffered, particularly their state-of-the-art control rooms. Mr Berruien says he is confident most of the damage can be repaired, however.Overcoming all the obstacles would return Libya to its prewar level of 1.6m b/d in about 15 months or so.But the big prize lies ahead. Mr Berruien firmly believes that the country, which holds Africa’s largest oil reserves, will be able to find new oilfields and boost its production above that level over the next five years.

Reliance Industries and global oil major BP hope to significantly boost natural gas output from the country’s largest gas field in the D-6 block in the next two to three years, and make handsome gains, as gas prices are due for revision in 2014, industry officials said, the Economic Times reports. BP last week completed its $7.2bn deal to acquire 30 per cent stake in Reliance’s 21 oil and gas blocks, including D-6 where natural gas output has fallen sharply as the reservoir turned out to be different from what the company had initially envisaged on the basis of surveys.Balls roll in Spain’s lottery IPO
Spain’s national lottery will this week begin marketing its €8bn privatisation to international investors in what is set to be the country’s largest ever stock market listing, the FT reports. Loterías y Apuestas del Estado, the state-controlled operator which runs the El Gordo Christmas draw, the worlds’ biggest by payout, is pressing ahead with its flotation in spite of a likely change of government in Spain’s November elections and ongoing market volatility.China orders ConocoPhillips field shutdown
Chinese regulators have ordered a shutdown at a troubled offshore oilfield operated by ConocoPhillips, a surprise escalation in a months-long oil spill off the coast of China that has released around 700 barrels of oil into the sea, the FT reports. The spill at the Penglai 19-3 field, which is jointly owned by ConocoPhillips and Chinese offshore producer Cnooc , is the biggest leak from an offshore rig ever reported in China and occurs at one of the country’s most established oilfields.Lenovo looks to the north
The Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group said it plans to become the No 1 PC vendor in Russia in the next three years, as part of its efforts to expand in emerging markets overseas, China Daily reports. Bai Yuli, general director of Lenovo in Russia, said that the company aims to take the prime position in the Russian PC market, overtaking competitors such as Acer Inc and ASUSTeK Computer Inc.Bank of Georgia set for full London listing
The London Stock Exchange is set to get its first full listing of a company from the former Soviet republic of Georgia in the shape of Bank of Georgia, the republic’s leading bank, the FT reports. The bank, which has more than a third of the Georgian banking market, is expected to announce as early as Monday that it intends to shift from having global depository receipts quoted on the LSE to a full premium listing, and to reincorporate as a UK holding company.Chery begins Venezuela assembly
When production began at Chery Automobile’s new Venezuela factory on Aug 29, it marked latest in a series of recent overseas moves by China’s biggest car exporter, China Daily reports. Assembly of its A1 and A3models in the state of Aragua will make Anhui-based Chery the first Chinese automaker to build cars in Venezuela. The plant will help meet strong pent-up demand in Venezuela that has arisen due to the country’s import duties, said Chery Vice-President Zhou Biren.Packer, Ho May Invest $1bn in Manila Casino
Australian billionaire James Packer and Lawrence Ho, son of Macau gambling mogul Stanley Ho, may invest at least $1bn in a Manila casino project, the Philippine gambling regulator said, Bloomberg reports. The Philippines is seeking to accelerate construction as bettors in Asia fuel casino growth in Singapore and Macau. Casino gambling revenue in Macau was four times that of the Las Vegas Strip in 2010 and has grown 47 per cent this year to 173bn patacas ($22bn).Emerging Markets

246;COP;Conocophillips;2011-09-04T19:33:55Z;China orders ConocoPhillips field shutdown;;"Chinese regulators have ordered a shutdown at a troubled offshore oilfield operated by ConocoPhillips, a surprise escalation in a months-long oil spill off the coast of China that has released around 700 barrels of oil into the sea.The spill at the Penglai 19-3 field, which is jointly owned by ConocoPhillips and Chinese offshore producer Cnooc, is the biggest leak from an offshore rig ever reported in China and occurs at one of the country’s most established oilfields. The industry is scrutinising Beijing’s reaction as a litmus test for how stricter environmental regulation will impact China’s extraction industries such as mining and oil and gas.China’s maritime regulator announced late on Friday that ConocoPhillips had failed to meet requirements for stopping the leaks, and that as a result production at the entire Penglai 19-3 field would be halted indefinitely.According to the Chinese regulator’s statement, ConocoPhillips reported on August 31 that the spills had been contained and cleaned up; however the regulators rejected that, saying that oil pollution remained on the sea floor and that oil was still seeping from the seabed.The trouble at Penglai 19-3 began in June, when two leaks occurred on June 4 and 17 at separate platforms. Neither the owners of the field nor Chinese regulators admitted the spills publicly until several weeks later, after the story leaked out in Chinese media.Although one of the spills was quickly ended by plugging and abandoning that well, problems festered at a second site where fresh leaks from the seabed floor continued to pop up in July and August.Analysts say that Beijing’s stern approach to the spill portends stricter environmental regulations to come, particularly as China moves further into challenging deepwater oil and gasfields in the South China Sea.“It’s similar to what happened in the nuclear industry after the Fukushima crisis,” said Gordon Kwan, head of energy research at Mirae Asset Securities. “This won’t stop China from moving forward on offshore exploration, but what they might do is slow down a bit.”Some in the industry believe ConocoPhillips has been singled out because it is a foreign company, as regulators hope to signal to overseas groups that they are serious about punishing environmental violations.China’s maritime authorities have historically been lenient in meting out punishments for oil spills, such as a large spill in Dalian last year that was caused by a refinery fire.China is the world’s biggest consumer of energy and second-biggest consumer of crude oil, after the US. Chinese state media report that ConocoPhillips could face lawsuits and legal damages over the spill.“ConocoPhillips believes we have been and will continue to be a prudent operator of the Peng Lai field,’’ the company said on Sunday.“We notified the authorities and our co-venturer, Cnooc, as soon as both incidents were discovered. We immediately focused on sealing the source, containment and clean up activities, and brought global resources and expertise to our response efforts. We will co-operate with Cnooc and ensure we comply with the terms of the [regulator’s] order.”Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty in Houston"
247;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Logic of corporate shrinkage asserts itself;;"The slimming of big business proceeds apace. We have already been treated to big spinoffs by the likes of Kraft and ConocoPhillips. More modestly, Tesco said last week it will sell its Japanese business, while GlaxoSmithKline pursued the sale of a £1.5bn ($2.4bn) assortment of over-the-counter medicines.The vogue for spinoffs and disposals is no doubt partly cyclical. The corporate urge to grow is intimately connected with so-called animal spirits. In times of doubt and depression, the underlying logic of getting smaller is more likely to assert itself.That logic seems to hold, by and large, in both good times and bad. A recent paper from McKinsey* calculates that in a sample of almost 60 large spinoffs since 1992, average operating margins rose markedly over the following five years – both in the spinoff and the parent.In one sense, this is what we should expect. The growth gene in successful companies means their boards have a bias towards acquisition, which tends on average to destroy value.Reducing the scale of the corporation goes against the grain – particularly for executives whose remuneration is tied to size. The case for a big disposal or demerger must therefore be the more compelling.There are other deterrents to getting smaller. Disposing of a business may be seen as strategic weakness – consider how commentators have leapt swiftly from Tesco’s minor exit from Japan to speculating about a bigger one from the US.Boards may also worry about losing economies of scale. But logic also points the opposite way.Corporations, like states, have a natural tendency towards bureaucracy. And while growth in scale economies – purchasing power, for instance – tends to be linear, that in bureaucracy tends to be exponential.Thus, as a corporation moves from small to medium size its operating staff – in manufacturing, in sales, in accounts – will grow in parallel. But as it gets bigger again, whole new functions sprout up – treasury, legal, investor relations and so forth.All those are costs that must be pushed down to the divisions. But suppose a given division already has the necessary scale within its own market. Hive it off, and it will retain scale economies while shedding the bureaucratic overhead. Hive off enough divisions, and the parent can shed the overhead as well.As McKinsey points out, demergers can be done for the wrong reasons. One such is the sum-of-the-parts argument beloved of brokers’ analysts.This takes each division of a corporation and compares it with a supposedly equivalent quoted company. Apply the earnings multiples on those companies to the divisions. If there is any shortfall, the corporation is worth more dead than alive – or, in another popular formulation, division X is in there for nothing.According to McKinsey, this is mostly sloppy work. Get inside those divisions and compare them with quoted companies really in the same business, and with comparable growth rates and returns on capital, and the valuation gap usually disappears.Other better reasons for demerger or disposal come to mind. A poorly performing division will be unloved. Fixing it properly would mean more immediate damage to the bottom line than leaving it alone. It would also draw attention to the division’s underperformance, and carry the risky promise of improvement.Alternatively, the division may be in an industry which needs consolidation. It might be qualified to lead that process. Getting the board to put cash behind it might be another question.Does that mean small is necessarily beautiful? Not so fast.Big companies, if properly run, can allocate cash to advantage across their divisions. The purist might say that is unnecessary; any spare cash should be returned to shareholders, who will allocate it themselves.But that presupposes the corporation has no particular skills that the shareholders lack. The whole premise of investing in Berkshire Hathaway over the years has been that Warren Buffett is better at spending his cash flow than outsiders would be.Big corporations also have the edge in raising debt capital. Banks will lend to them below cost in hopes of corporate and advisory business. Bond markets are open to them when they are closed to smaller and less liquid borrowers.And big corporations play an important role in buying out entrepreneurs who – as very often happens – have reached their personal wealth targets and would rather quit the game than double up. If the function of entrepreneurs is to take the initial risk, it is usually that of big business to carry it forward and diversify it.Horses for courses, then. But the general case is clear. If I were a portfolio manager, I would sooner back divesters than acquirers any day.*“Finding the Courage to Shrink”, by Bill Huyett and Tim Kollertony.jackson@ft.com"
248;COP;Conocophillips;2011-08-30T05:26:26Z;Doing business in China: a tale of two oil spills;;"An oil spill might seem like an unlikely place to look for lessons about doing business in China.But in the choppy waters of the Bohai Bay, US oil giant ConocoPhillips is learning the hard way that not all oil spills – or oil companies – were created equal.The saga of the Bohai oil spill goes back to June 4, when oil was spotted seeping out of a fault on the ocean floor near a drilling platform in the Penglai 19-3 field, which is operated by ConocoPhillips, but jointly owned by Conoco (49 per cent) and Cnooc (51 per cent).Two weeks later, a second oil leak was spotted at another drilling site two miles away, prompting Conoco to plug and abandon that well.Although ConocoPhillips says they promptly reported the spill to authorities, neither China’s maritime regulators nor the companies made any statement about the spill until early July, after a Chinese paper ran an expose.Chinese regulators initially greeted the spill with a yawn, saying in July that ConocoPhillips might face fines of Rmb200,000 ($31,000).However the situation has steadily snowballed. On Monday, the State Ocean Administration says it is preparing to sue ConocoPhillips for its role in the spill, and lawyers have come forward to collect compensation claims from fishermen who they say were impacted.In recent weeks Chinese media have reported 10 new oil seeps on the ocean floor, while the government has given ConocoPhillips a Wednesday deadline to complete cleanup efforts.While none of these steps seem particularly unusual as a way to deal with an environmental disaster, they stand in stark contrast to China’s huge oil spill last summer, when a refinery fire at Dalian caused hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil to be released directly into the sea.Thick black oil clogged the beached of Dalian and cleanup efforts were so haphazard that fisherman were sent out to scoop oil off the ocean surfaces with plastic pots and bare hands. But in striking contrast to the ConocoPhillips spill (where around 3,200 barrels of oil were released into the sea), no Chinese company was ever fined or found to be at fault for the environmental disaster in Dalian.The refinery where the spill occurred was jointly owned by Dalian Port and by CNPC, China’s largest oil and gas producer. The city government led the cleanup efforts, with assistance from CNPC, and the government very publicly launched an investigation into the causes of the spill.The findings of that committee have never been publicly released however, and the companies involved with the spill have not reported any fines. Fishermen in the area who saw their livelihood destroyed with the spill petitioned their local governments for compensation, with no result.Some Chinese media columnists reported that CNPC had reached an agreement to make up for the spill with more investments in Dalian, which would in turn generate revenue for the local government. The events at Deepwater Horizon last year caught the attention of Chinese regulators, and it seems that this summer the government may have decided to make an example out of the spill at Penglai block 19-3.There’s little question that China’s abysmal environmental record could benefit from serious and transparent punishments for the worst offenders; though this is difficult because offenders are sometimes closely linked to local governments, as in Dalian.But China’s microblogs have been quick to latch on to the discrepancies between the ConocoPhillips experience and earlier spills.As Huang Yigang, a newspaper editor in Hangzhou tweeted: “Just because it is ConocoPhillips, Chinese media, government and people are all condemning the company and demanding compensation. But if it was CNPC, or Dalian PX, all will be mute”.Related reading:

249;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US authorities assess hurricane’s aftermath;;Hurricane Irene left at least 35 people dead and nearly 5.5m businesses and homes without power, as states along the US east coast began the massive clean-up effort.The eastern seaboard of the US from South Carolina to Maine suffered the main brunt of the storm with widespread flooding, power outages and property damage.Although New York City was mainly spared, millions were unable to return to work due to road and rail disruptions. New York subways and buses resumed service on Monday morning but the Long Island Rail Road remained partly closed. The Metro-North Railroad expects to restore limited service in the afternoon.By Monday morning, many analysts had downgraded their forecast losses devised before the hurricane hit. Kinetic Analysis Corp halved their initial estimate of total storm damage from $20bn to less than $10bn.The Consumer Federation of America forecast that wind damage could total $5bn in personal claims, with a further $2bn in claims related to widespread flooding.The Associated Press reported at least 35 deaths in 10 states.Claims may rise in the coming weeks, however, as compiling losses from flooding and wind damage will take some time.After falling at the end of last week, insurance stocks rose on Monday morning, as the extent of damage did not reach anticipated levels.Two insurance companies listed in New York, Hartford Financial Services and Allstate, both saw their share prices rise sharply on Monday.“Claims are starting to come in,” said Dick Leudke, spokesman for State Farm, the largest insurer of cars and homes in the US. “But we’ve learnt not to have expectations. It’s impossible to predict.”But some analysts said that much of the damage would not be covered by private insurance. Robert Hunter, insurance analyst at the Consumer Federation of America said: “A lot is flooding which they don’t cover, and other infrastructure, which the municipalities self-insure for.”“I don’t think impact on insurance industry will be huge, maybe $5bn,” he said.Clean-up efforts were in full force as Irene left a trail of destruction including mass flooding, toppled trees and fallen debris. The US Department of Energy reported that 5.48m customers were without power as of 10am local time on Monday.Utility companies whose transmission lines had been thrashed by the storm fought to restore power to homes on Monday. Meanwhile, oil and gas refineries, such as those operated by ConocoPhillips and Sunoco, have battled to return to normal production patterns.Robert McDonnell, Virginia’s governor, said his state suffered the second-largest power outage ever and warned that electricity might take a week to be restored. Heavy flooding was reported in Vermont, while waters continued to rise in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.Barack Obama, US president, warned on Sunday that recovery efforts would take weeks, saying “this is not over”.“Response and recovery efforts will be an ongoing operation,” he said.Mr Obama declared a federal state of emergency in several states, which means federal funds will cover much of the cost of the disaster clean-up.Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, said on Monday the cost to the state would be high, although it would be alleviated by the federal disaster relief declaration. “It’s my guess costs will be in the tens of millions,” he said to ABC News.Much of the focus as Irene neared the mainland was on its trajectory, which had New York City in its sights, making it the first named storm to hit the nation’s financial capital since 1985.While the majority of Manhattan dodged the most damaging effects of the storm, coastal neighbourhoods in Staten Island and Queens were hit with flooding and power outages.Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor, had come under criticism last year for his handling of the post-Christmas blizzard in New York. He was a much more visible presence this time around. He said on Sunday that he “had made exactly the right call”.“Bloomberg was making up for his failures during the blizzard last year,” said Doug Muzzio, professor of public affairs at the City University of New York. “I think he did it successfully – he was on the television constantly, he directed the city’s response. Overall an ‘A’ for effort, an ‘A’ for performance. He pulled up his grade substantially from the winter semester.”
250;COP;Conocophillips;2011-08-28T15:20:20Z;China’s oil groups ready for more deals;;Solid first-half profits at China’s state-owned oil companies have paved the way for further expansion overseas as the country’s oil needs continue to rise.Sinopec, the world’s second-largest oil refiner, said on Sunday it intended to raise up to Rmb50bn ($7.8bn) through the sale of bonds and convertible bonds to fund projects, boost working capital and pay debts. The instruments will be issued or placed with existing shareholders, Sinopec said.The fundraising plan accompanied the company’s announcement of a 12 per cent rise in net profit, to Rmb41bn, in the first half of the year, beating analysts’ expectations.Results were rosier still for offshore producer Cnooc, which reported first-half net profit of Rmb39bn, up 51.4 per cent, despite production disruptions from a recent oil spill.PetroChina, the listed subsidiary of China’s largest oil and gas producer CNPC, reported net profit of Rmb66bn for the first half, up 1 per cent from a year earlier, the weakest profit growth among its peers. Profits at both PetroChina and Sinopec were dented by Beijing’s price controls on fuel, which capped gasoline and diesel prices this spring even while Brent soared above $120 a barrel.Analysts agreed Chinese oil companies were likely to sustain their interest in overseas acquisitions as they seek to grow their production base.“They are always looking,” said Graham Cunningham, analyst at Citi. “Especially if oil prices come down, all three of the Chinese oil companies are going to be in the market for M&A.”China is the world’s biggest energy user and second-largest consumer of oil, after the US.China’s state-owned oil companies have emerged as a major force in global mergers and acquisitions in the past five years, as they carry out their mandate to improve China’s energy security by pinning down new supplies of oil.Major Chinese oil deals this year include Cnooc’s $1.3bn investment in shale oil projects with Chesapeake Energy of Oklahoma, and more recently Cnooc’s $2.1bn purchase of Opti Canada, an oil sands producer.However, other prominent deals – including PetroChina’s proposed $5.4bn tie up with Canadian energy company Encana – have fallen through, underscoring the difficulties of M&A at a time of volatile crude prices.Some industry executives also point out that recent leadership changes at China’s big oil companies may dampen M&A activity this year as people settle into their new roles. In a state-directed reshuffle this spring, Fu Chengyu, Cnooc chairman, was appointed chairman of Sinopec, while Su Shulin, Sinopec president, was promoted to a political role in Fujian province.Beijing routinely moves around top leaders of state-owned enterprises as a means to indirectly maintain state control. Mr Su’s move to Fujian follows a history of other top Chinese leadership, including China’s security chief Zhou Yongkang, who have gone from the oil industry on to the highest levels of power.Cnooc also took the unusual step of apologising for the oil spill that occurred this summer in the Bohai Bay on an offshore block it co-owns with ConocoPhillips. The industry has been watching closely as Chinese regulators deal with the spill, which they say is the largest from an offshore rig in Chinese waters.Last week the government said it was preparing to sue ConocoPhillips, the operator of the wells, over the spill, which released about 3,200 barrels of oil and fluids into the ocean. Spill-related closures also prompted Cnooc to lower its production forecast for 2011.
251;COP;Conocophillips;2011-08-24T20:28:09Z;HP should have avoided a big bang;The chief executive should have taken things steadily;"When a chief executive unveils a new strategy to shareholders after nine months in the job, they hope for warm applause, not for widespread alarm and a 20 per cent drop in the share price.Léo Apotheker, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, provoked the latter last week when he married lower earnings guidance with a plan to acquire Autonomy, the UK software company, for an extremely high price, and to spin off HP’s huge personal computer division. After a fractious call with analysts, his irritated shareholders demonstrated their discontent.As a result, Mr Apotheker is spending the week wooing investors and media outlets in New York and London (including a visit to the Financial Times) in an effort to restore order. But it will take more than a dose of personal attention to establish his credibility.Even if the new strategy is vindicated, which it may eventually be, he needlessly alienated investors by thrusting so much unpalatable information and future uncertainty on them at once. He should have taken things steadily rather than making a big bang.That mis-step carries lessons for other chief executives who seek to make a decisive impact within a few months of their arrival. The temptation, often encouraged by action-hungry analysts and journalists, is to break up companies such as HP in pursuit of clarity and focus. Muddling along with what they inherited feels like an arduous and imperfect compromise.But chief executives need to establish authority and to set a clear path before they can expect insiders or outsiders to follow their new direction. Investors interpreted Mr Apotheker’s burst of dealmaking, allied to the outlook, as evidence not of vision but of panic.The irony is that HP wants to make itself more like IBM, the business software and services giant revived by Louis Gerstner, who refused to act precipitously after taking over in 1993. Instead of selling mainframe computers and dismembering Big Blue, as he was urged to do, he kept it big.“ Keeping IBM together was the first strategic decision and, I believe, the most important business decision I ever made …we threw out the investment bankers who were arranging IPOs of all the pieces …we threw out the naming consultants who had decided that the printer division should be called ‘Pennant’ and the storage division ‘Adstar’,” he wrote in his memoir Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance?Mr Gerstner and his successors went on to restructure IBM, and indeed to spin off and sell large parts of it – including the sale of the personal computer business to Lenovo in 2005. But by the time they did so, they had proved that their alternative vision worked in practice as well as on a consultant’s slide.By contrast, Mr Apotheker is pinning his hopes, and $11bn of his shareholders’ money, on planting Autonomy at the core of a high-margin software business that now contributes less than 3 per cent of sales. The dull, but well-proven and cash-generative, PC business would have departed before that ambition is fulfilled in 2015.HP knows that acquisitions often do not work; among other things last week, Mr Apotheker announced the closure of the hardware division of Palm, a company that Mark Hurd, his predecessor, bought for $1.2bn last year. Barely had the TouchPad tablet been launched with a fanfare than it was ditched.He also presented his fait accompli to investors whom he had assured in June that he was aiming for “the fastest evolutionary path possible” rather than a revolution, and who feel misled. Several of the biggest are value investors that acquired HP shares because they wanted stable cash flow, not volatile growth.Mr Apotheker is not solely responsible – he seems to have the backing of HP’s board, which itself suffers from a lack of credibility after an era of instability at the top. Both Mr Hurd and Carly Fiorina, who was chief executive before him, departed amid discord.“The board was thoroughly advised on what would happen. We all knew this was going to be very difficult,” says one of those involved. If so, it is hard to grasp why they did it – unless such Silicon Valley figures as Meg Whitman, Marc Andreessen and Ray Lane, the chairman, do not care about Wall Street investors.Spin-offs are not bad per se and many value investors like them as a way of releasing assets within conglomerates. Indeed, encouraged by the same investment bankers who put these companies together in the first place, they are all the rage among oil enterprises such as ConocoPhillips and consumer companies such as Kraft.Nor does the fact that a company’s shares fall when an incoming chief executive announces a growth strategy prove that they are wrong. James Murdoch, for example, alienated British Sky Broadcasting investors in 2003 by going for growth rather than handing them its surplus cash, but he was later vindicated (before becoming embroiled in the News of the World phone hacking scandal this year).Leaders have to establish their operational credibility before their investors will buy their promises – either that, or they face a long and tough period demonstrating that they were right after all. The fact that Mr Gerstner avoided such a struggle by starting out at IBM unshowily paid long-term dividends.Mr Apotheker’s appointment last year was, typically for HP, mired in controversy and I defended him at the time from detractors such as Larry Ellison of Oracle. Now he must prove himself."
252;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Full Libyan oil output could be years away;;Libya could return to the global oil market within weeks after the rebels appeared to be on the brink of victory, but the full resumption of output is months, if not years, away.Libya produced about 1.6m barrels a day of oil before the start of the civil war, but the six-month conflict has reduced the flow to just 50,000 b/d, according to industry estimates.Consultants and industry executives believe the fall of the 41-year-old regime of Muammer Gaddafi could see Libya producing 300,000 b/d during the next three months from fields in the east, which have been under rebel control since the start of the civil war, and the remote south-west desert. But ramping up output to pre-crisis levels would take years under the most benign scenario.“I’m sceptical that Libya will return to its pre-war output until 2013 or well beyond,” says Ben Cahill, an expert on Libya at oil consultants PFC Energy in Washington, echoing a widely held industry’s view.Wood Mackenzie, the oil consultancy, agrees, saying in a report issued last week it would take about 36 months for the country’s crude oil output to recover to pre-crisis levels.The experience in previous oil disruptions, from Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution to Venezuela following the opposition-backed oil strike of 2002-03, indicates that production takes a considerable time to return to normal levels. In Iraq, although the oil infrastructure emerged largely intact from the US-led invasion in 2003, output only returned to its pre-war level in 2008 as the end of the hostilities saw political chaos, widespread looting and attacks on the infrastructure.“Even if Tripoli can be secured by rebel forces, as the second Iraq war demonstrated, how effectively the peace can be policed will be vital to a rapid restart in production,” says Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JPMorgan and a former senior official at the International Energy Agency.Executives and consultants fear that divisions among the rebels could lead to similar problems in Libya. Even if the country avoids the political and security pitfalls, geology would be an obstacle in the key Sirte basin, which accounts for about two-thirds of Libya’s oil output. The fields there are mature and, as a result, are likely to require extensive repairs to restore production.Moreover, some oil export terminals, including Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, in the centre of the country, and Melitah, in the west, have been damaged. Oil companies say their vehicles have disappeared from compounds, while high prices for base metals such as copper are encouraging looting by local gangs. Thus, the most likely scenario is a progressive ramp up in output.Shokri Ghanem, the former Libyan oil minister who defected three months ago, said the country cannot start pumping right away due to damage and looting, but could produce up to 400,000 b/d in three to four months. “But to go back to the level they used to produce it may take two years,” he told Platts, the industry publication.But with oil prices above $100 a barrel, the financial incentives to resume full production are so great that the new government, and foreign oil companies, will work extremely hard to accelerate output.The east of the country would be the first to start producing again through the Benghazi-based Arab Arabian Gulf Oil Company. Agoco broke links with the Gaddafi-controlled National Oil Company months ago and could, eventually, pump 440,000 b/d from oil fields in the east including Sarir, Libya’s largest.Agoco briefly exported some oil earlier in the war, but was forced to stop after Gaddafi forces attacked the fields. Since then, the rebel national transitional council has been forming a protection force to allow for repairs. Agoco believes the repairs could be completed in two or three weeks, and using a 500km long pipeline that cuts across the desert of eastern Libya it could restart production soon.The outlook for other areas is more uncertain as oil companies have yet to assess damage to their facilities. Foreign executives have offered upbeat forecasts, saying they could restart production before the end of the year. Among the most bullish is Repsol YPF of Spain, the second-largest foreign oil company in Libya by production, and Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF of Germany. Miguel Martínez, chief operating officer at Repsol, told analysts last month the company could be pumping within four weeks of the end of the war from its operated fields that produce 350,000 b/d.Eni of Italy could also restore production from the offshore fields relatively quickly too. The area, known as the Pelagian basin, is 100km north of Tripoli in the Mediterranean.The prospects for the central Sirte basin, which has been controlled by Col Gaddafi, is far more sombre. The Gaddafi-loyal National Oil Company has controlled there two important subsidiaries, its wholly owned Sirte Oil, and Waha Oil, a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Hess. Industry consultants say the area has sustained damage, requiring extensive repairs.

She is much more interested in the geopolitics of shale gas.“I hear about people who don’t want these kinds of things, but it gives us a chance to free ourselves from Russia,” she says. “We aren’t worried at all.”Poland is seeking to slash its reliance on Russian energy through exploiting its big reserves of shale gas – natural gas trapped in fragile rock.A British company, 3Legs Resources, has drilled one of Poland’s first shale test wells on Ms Religa’s farm, and says it has encountered “high gas saturations”. 3Legs is one of a host of companies, including ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Chevron, that have joined the Polish rush for shale gas.According to the US Energy Information Administration, Poland may have as much as 5,300bn cubic metres of the gas – the largest reserves in Europe. This is more even than France, which has turned against drilling on environmental grounds.The gas is potentially accessible thanks to new techniques of pumping water, sand and chemicals underground at high pressure – known as hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” – to release trapped gas.“When we started there were many doubts over whether the gas existed at all,” says John Buggenhagen, exploration director at San Leon Energy, which has 10 gas concessions in Poland. “But we are seeing better results than we ever expected.”The country currently uses 14bn cubic metres of gas a year, 9bn of which come from Russia, Poland’s old imperial master. If shale gas is found in large quantities – and certainty will only come within three to five years – it could turn Poland into an energy exporter.Gas could also help with Poland’s pollution problem. Currently, about 85 per cent of Polish electricity is generated by coal, which will become increasingly untenable thanks to EU restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions.“We are determined that the exploration and extraction of shale gas in Poland becomes a fact,” Donald Tusk, the prime minister, said recently, staking out a position very different from the recent French moratorium on shale gas exploration.The French decision is viewed in Poland as a Machiavellian effort to boost exports of its nuclear reactors. “France is pursuing its own narrow French interests,” says Jacek Krawiec, the boss of state oil refiner PKN-Orlen.The prospect of finding large shale gas deposits is changing PKN itself. Instead of hunting for oil, the company is looking to a future as essentially a gas and electricity company.“Orlen wants to be a leader in gas extraction,” said Mr Krawiec at one of the increasingly numerous Polish conferences dedicated to shale gas.However, Poland will have to upgrade its gas transmission facilities if it wants to benefit from any gas boom. The country is already spending 8bn zlotys ($2.8bn) building a liquid natural gas terminal on the Baltic coast – at the moment only for importing, not exporting gas – and an additional 1,000km of gas pipelines to connect Poland to Germany and the Czech Republic.“What we are doing now will also apply in the event of shale gas exploitation,” says Jan Chadam, CEO of Gaz-System, the state-owned operator of Poland's natural gas pipelines. “We will have to expand the system if shale gas truly exists in large amounts.”
254;COP;Conocophillips;2011-08-08T21:46:20Z;Oil leads sell-off as raw materials tumble;Among leading commodities, oil led the correction;Commodities prices fell across the board with the exception of precious metals as investors worried that global economic growth is slowing down.The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a basket of commodities, fell 2.8 per cent by late afternoon in London, hitting 317 points, its lowest level since December, dragged down by a sharp drop in oil and copper prices.The index has fallen 14.3 per cent since a peak set in April.Natural resource stocks underperformed actual commodities prices by a large margin.Household sector names including Xstrata, Glencore, ConocoPhillips and Archer Daniels Midland saw their shares fall between 4 and 8 per cent on the day, extending last week’s large drop.Colin Fenton, head of commodities research at JPMorgan in New York, said that, in the near term, most commodity markets appeared “likely to convulse lower, as a growth scare dislodges physical inventories and impairs orders”.But Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in London, was somewhat more positive, telling clients that, although risk to the bank’s “constructive commodity views” had risen, he maintained an “overweight” recommendation on commodities relative to other asset classes.Among major commodities, oil led the correction as investors bet that an economic slowdown would cut demand for the commodity just as Saudi Arabia ramps up its production.In late afternoon trading in London, ICE September Brent fell nearly $7 to a session low of $102.70 a barrel, dropping below the crucial 200-day moving average. It was later down $6.17 at $103.20.The breakdown of the technical level suggest that prices could fall lower as speculators sell. Nymex September West Texas Intermediate fell $6.01 to $80.87 a barrel.But some analysts believe that the sell-off in oil markets could peter out soon.While the oil market has been affected by the “risk-on, risk-off” trend in the markets, the overall fundamentals in supply and demand have not changed, said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity market strategy at BNP Paribas.While the fall in appetite for risk has hit the oil price, “the overall picture which pushed oil above $100 hasn’t changed,” he said. “On a risk-reward basis, going long WTI at around $83 to $84 is very attractive,” Mr Tchilinguirian said.Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank, agreed, saying he had yet to revise his price targets for oil prices.While financial markets were responding to the S&P downgrade of US debt, last week’s US employment figures painted a more positive picture of the country’s economic situation, he said.
255;COP;Conocophillips;2011-08-04T20:58:57Z;Wall Street tumbles on economic concerns;;US stocks tumbled to their worst one-day losses for more than two years with industrial and energy stocks leading the declines as a surge in the dollar raised fears that exporters would be hit by higher costs.All three major US indices entered correction territory, meaning they were more than 10 per cent lower that their 2011 highs. The benchmark S&P 500 retreated 4.7 per cent on Thursday to 1,200.24 at the closing bell. It was the worst session since February 2009.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day in more than two years, falling more than 500 points or 4.3 per cent to 11,383.83, while the Nasdaq Composite was off 5.1 per cent to 2,556.39, its worst session since January 2009.The CBOE Volatility index or Vix, popularly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge“, jumped to its highest level since March, up 29.64 per cent on the session to more than 30.The S&P energy sector fell 6.8 per cent, materials lost 6.7 per cent and industrials were down 5.4 per cent, all hit by the rising dollar and weakening market sentiment.Alcoa was the Dow’s biggest faller at the close, retreating 9.2 per cent to $12.94, while Caterpillar was 7 per cent lower at $89.55.In the energy sector, which reached its lowest level since March, the US oil majors were hit hard.ExxonMobil fell 5 per cent to $73.84, ConocoPhillips was down 5.2 per cent to $66.92 and Chevron lost 5.8 per cent to $96.84.Alpha Natural Resources reported a $56.4m second-quarter loss, much of which was due to takeover-related costs after acquiring Massey Energy for $7.1bn in June. Its shares dropped 17 per cent to $33.24.In addition to concerns about global economic growth and currency stability, weekly US initial jobless claims weighed on sentiment, with the 400,000 figure less than the 405,000 that was forecast.Wall Street was also anticipating Friday’s nonfarm payroll report for July, one of the most important economic indicators, which has disappointed in the last two months“Having been burned badly the last two months, it appears that this time a lot of traders have been exiting positions and going to the sidelines ahead of the US non-farm payrolls report,” analysts at CMC Markets said. “This suggests that unlike the last two months where pre-announcement euphoria ended up being crushed, the resignation and despondency seen today could set the table for a positive surprise.”Kraft was one of the few bright spots, leading the Dow after news that the US food company would split into two divisions.As well as reporting forecast-beating results, the maker of macaroni and cheese, Oreos and Kool Aid said it would spin-off its grocery business from the faster-growing snack business. Its shares were 1.5 per cent lower at $33.78.Among retailers, individual July same-store sales figures were mixed but sent the S&P retail sector 4.9 per cent lower.As a whole, the Retail Metrics July same-store sales index rose 5 per cent, with 58 per cent of retailers beating forecasts. “Retailers catering to higher-end consumers outperformed once again in July,” the report said.But mid-level department store group Kohl’s, which was expected to miss sales expectations, fell 7.9 per cent to $47.67.Shares in Gap, the clothing store, fell 11.6 per cent to $16.98, one of the worst-hit retailers of the session. Shares in the troubled retailer have fallen nearly 30 per cent from its 2011 high.Costco, the discount retailer, reported a 15 per cent bump in sales against a similar period last year, registering net sales of $6.4bn. Gasoline inflation and foreign exchange rates both worked in the chain’s favour, Citigroup analysts noted. Its shares were off just 0.7 per cent to $76.51.Limited Brands also reported strong sales and boosted its outlook for the second quarter, which left its stock 1.27 per cent lower at $35.84. The company, whose brands include Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said same-store sales rose 6 per cent over 2010, beating analysts’ expectations.Elsewhere among the earnings reports, General Motors said its quarterly profit nearly doubled to $2.5bn on strong North American and Asian sales. Earnings per share in the carmaker were $1.54, beating analysts’ expectations.“We believe this quarter should begin to revive momentum around the GM story,” Citigroup analysts said. “Recent market share gains, resilient pricing and now a high-quality quarter are all occurring ahead of GM’s major North America product cycle.”But the strong earnings did little to boost GM shares, which fell 4.3 per cent to $25.99. Its domestic competitor, Ford, was down 6.8 per cent to $10.86.DirecTV, the US satellite broadcaster, reported that net income rose to $701m, or 91 cents a share, but its market share shrunk, adding just 26,000 US subscribers. Its shares dropped 5.7 per cent to $46.63.A key concern is that DirecTV’s model is “structurally flawed vs the cable operators”, analysts at Collins Stewart noted. They were optimistic about the outlook because “DirecTV has been able to withstand the crippling US recession and housing crises because of its premium brand and superior service.”
256;COP;Conocophillips;2011-08-04T18:07:13Z;Break-ups are part of make-up;;Kraft is no stranger to break-ups. The US food group itself was created in a separation from parent Phillip Morris, which after a 2001 initial public offering sold the remainder of its stake six years later.The company also benefited from splits elsewhere, launching its $19bn hostile bid for Cadbury three years after Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, successfully lobbied for the confectioner to shed its soft drinks arm.That deal, Kraft said, pre-empted the latest move to divide into a cash-generative, US-focused grocery group and a snacks business focused growth in developing markets.In doing so, the group has joined a growing list of US companies opting for focus, in a bid to increase the valuations given to their constituent parts and improve operational performance.Companies in the oil sector, notably Conoco-Phillips, have decided to divide downstream refining from exploration and production operations. Sara Lee, Fortune Brands and ITT have also announced separations in the past year.“It all starts with a judgement by the board that there is a persistent undervaluation of the pre-split or pre-spin business,” said Roger Altman, founder of Evercore Partners, which has advised companies including Tyco, Cendant and Kraft on their separations.“If we are in some kind of correction phase from a market point of view, we will probably see more of these,” added Mr Altman, as markets tumbled on Thursday. “The frequency of undervaluations as seen by boards will increase.”Divestments already account for close to a record share of global mergers and acquisitions activity so far this year, according to Dealogic. In the US, spin-offs are close to 6 per cent of total deals, up from less than 2 per cent in 2010.People familiar with Kraft’s thinking said that it had become clear that the market was not giving the company credit for the higher-growth snacks business, bolstered by purchases including LU biscuits and Cadbury.While valuations vary over time, food companies with greater emerging markets exposure, such as Danone and Nestlé, should trade on earnings multiples in the high teens, they added. US-centric businesses, or those focused on maximising cash flow from prominent brands, tend instead to command a low to mid teens multiple.But beyond a financial arbitrage, companies are reassessing the operational benefits of keeping distinct business lines together, say bankers. In reality, concede advisers privately, investment fashions come and go. Kraft, after all, had until Thursday spent a decade diversifying from its roots in US food, after the 2000 merger with Nabisco.For Kraft, the theory goes, managers in its grocery arm will be able to focus on cutting costs and marketing well-known brands, while those in the racier snack business concentrate on investment in new products and new distribution channels globally.Activist investors have also played a role in kick-starting or accelerating companies’ efforts to refocus their operations.Pershing Square, which owns a 1.3 per cent stake in Kraft, was active in encouraging Fortune Brands to divide its hotch potch of businesses. Meanwhile, activist investor Jana Partners this week joined forces with a Canadian pension plan to press for a break-up at McGraw-Hill, whose businesses span text books to credit ratings.
257;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Activist investors press for McGraw-Hill shake-up;Hedge fund and Canadian pension plan band together;An activist hedge fund has joined forces with one of Canada’s largest pension funds to press for changes at McGraw-Hill that could lead to a break-up of the school books to credit rating conglomerate.Jana Partners and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan announced in a regulatory filing on Monday that they have raised their joint stake in the $12.5bn company to 5.2 per cent, from 3.3 per cent in March. Jana met the company two weeks ago and intends to lobby for changes to the corporate structure, people familiar with the situation said.The move comes weeks after the owner of the Standard & Poor’s rating agency told investors it had begun a strategic review of its entire portfolio, looking to increase shareholder value by focusing on faster-growing core global brands.“Everything is being scrutinised [and] we expect to continue this process with a number of significant actions in the second half of this year,” Terry McGraw, chairman and chief executive, told analysts last week.These would include steps beyond a previously announced auction of its broadcasting group, which owns local US TV stations, and its creation of a new division called McGraw-Hill Financial, including S&P Indices and Capital IQ.It has appointed Goldman Sachs to advise it alongside Morgan Stanley, which is running the broadcast group auction.Jana, which manages about $3bn in invested and committed capital, pressed for the break-up last year of TNT, a Dutch logistics company, and this year raised its stake in El Paso, a natural gas company that has since announced it will split in two. Ontario Teachers is an investor in Jana, according to a person familiar with the situation.Peter Appert, a Piper Jaffray analyst, said that logical candidates for disposal included business media assets such as JD Power, Aviation Week and the company’s construction information group, but that Mr McGraw’s talk of “significant actions” implied bigger moves.Depressed current results and a limited pool of strategic buyers made a sale or spin-off of the educational publishing division less likely, Mr Appert said, though other analysts said that separation of the financial and education businesses would present two “pure-play” companies to investors.Analysts value the education business – which competes with Pearson, owner of the FT, in selling textbooks and digital content to schools and colleges – at $2.5bn-$3.3bn. Goldman Sachs estimated last month that McGraw-Hill Construction was worth $563m, Aviation Week $116m and the broadcast group $137m.McGraw has also sought to appease investors by accelerating share buy-backs. In June, its board authorised buy-backs of up to 50m shares, or 17 per cent of its stock.Mr McGraw, who in the past has been seen as resistant to the idea of a break-up, is on the board of ConocoPhillips, the oil and gas group which recently became the latest US company to decide to break itself up.People familiar with the matter said that the idea of a break-up of McGraw-Hill’s education, rating and information businesses had been discussed by the company in the past, before the financial crisis cast a shadow over the S&P rating unit.In the past year, companies including Sara Lee, ITT and Fortune Brands have decided to separate disparate parts of their businesses, in some instances under pressure from activist investors.The company said its portfolio review had begun last year “and is expected to continue with additional significant actions in 2011”, noting that it was stepping up share buy-backs and reviewing costs, and that the legal and regulatory environment around S&P was “vastly improving”.
258;COP;Conocophillips;2011-08-01T19:13:35Z;Petrobras chief bullish on Brazil oil output;;Brazil could follow the same production growth as the North Sea experienced in its first decade, according to the chief executive of Petrobras, the country’s state-controlled oil champion.Petrobras has so far discovered 15bn barrels of proved reserves in an area called the “pre-salt”, lying below a 2km-deep salt layer under the seabed and estimated to hold up to 50bn barrels of oil. The group is forecasting daily production of 6.42m barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020.Jose Sergio Gabrielli, the group’s chief executive, said the country’s forecasts put it “at the same slope of production as in the first 10 years of the North Sea”.Production from the North Sea, by both the UK and Norway, reached peak production of 6m barrels a day in 1999.Petrobras expects to produce 2.77m boe/day this year. The pre-salt’s share of total domestic oil production will increase from 2 per cent in 2011 to 40.5 per cent in 2020.The company, said Mr Gabrielli, is growing faster than “Exxon, Shell, Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Eni … you name it”. Whether Petrobras would be the world’s top producer in 2020 depended “on the speed of the others”.“Oil growth is a matter of discovery and resources. If you don’t have the resources, you need to buy,” he added, presenting the company’s five-year business plan in London.Petrobras plans to invest $224.7bn between 2011 and 2015, with 57 per cent of this going towards exploration and production projects. The company’s current break-even price for oil produced from the area is $45 a barrel – compared with the current market price of about $120 a barrel for Brent crude, said Mr Gabrielli, adding that it could be even better as the company increases its productivity.Petrobas has also launched a disposal plan, aiming to raise $13.6bn, in order to increase its return on assets. It might “farm out” blocks at home and abroad to raise cash, as well as selling shares in Brazilian companies, the company said.Mr Gabrielli also said the company would keep investing in domestic refining capacity. Demand for oil products in Brazil is growing rapidly and Petrobras would lose market share if it did not expand. The company operates 100 per cent of the refining capacity in Brazil but has a market share of just 40 per cent of the domestic fuel market. The country’s last greenfield refinery, he said, was built in 1980.Petrobras could earn an extra $8 a barrel margin if it refined oil domestically rather than simply exporting crude oil, added Almir Barbassa, chief financial officer.Mr Gabrielli also added his voice to the industry debate about whether the integrated model – combining refining and marketing operations with an exploration and production arm – was out of date in the wake of the decision by America’s ConocoPhillips to split itself into two.“Integrated oil companies make a better return in general,” he said.
259;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-31T19:57:22Z;Size matters but reasons to split can be compelling;Split-ups have become something of a corporate fad. It sounds like an outbreak of managerial modesty, writes Edward Hadas;Managers rarely like the idea that their companies should shrink to greatness. Corporate size usually correlates with salaries, self-esteem and – they can argue – with efficiency, strong market positions and value for shareholders. Foolish or dubious acquisitions are much more common than substantial divestitures, whether wise or pointless. Split-ups, though, have recently become something of a corporate fad. In the last year Motorola, Sara Lee, Fortune Brands, Fiat, ITT and ConocoPhillips have all divided their operations into separately quoted companies or announced the intention to do so. It sounds like an outbreak of managerial modesty.Humility is not always the intention. The dis-integration of ConocoPhillips was presented as changing the company from the smallest of the oil majors – a tough place to be – into two big players in healthier sectors, pure upstream (exploration and production) and US downstream (refining and marketing). At Fiat, Sergio Marchionne remains in charge of the car and the industrial operations. His company’s split is best seen as a tactical manoeuvre in a grand strategy of turning a second-tier car company into a global player.Still, some of these moves are recognitions of past strategic mistakes. Motorola is responding to a long decline in the mobile phone business. Sara Lee is continuing to retreat from an apparently random diversification strategy. The company used to produce tights, shoe polish and yeast along with cakes, bacon and coffee. The ITT retreat has been even more comprehensive. This is the second three-way split for the 1960s poster child for financial engineering and extensive diversification. The first was back in 1989.Should split-ups be on the strategy menu of more corporations? Yes. Size has disadvantages as well as advantages, which should be weighed in the balance regularly.Consider first the good reasons for bringing together disparate operations. To start, a big group has management resources which are not available to a small company. Even without much in the way of product cross-fertilisation or marketing synergies, the imposition of professional discipline in basic business skills such as purchasing, marketing and inventory control – expertise that is relatively easy to transfer across industries – can improve sales as well as profit margins.For expanding operations in need of capital, a corporate owner can be more patient and sage about funding than a loan officer or an institutional investor. On the other side of the growth curve, managers of businesses with more cash flow than investment opportunities can usually deflect calls for special dividends from outside shareholders – but have to cough up cash to a corporate owner.Size also brings financial gains. Diversification across industries should reduce the chance of bankruptcy, and thus the cost of debt financing. Greater size also brings more stock market liquidity – probably good for the share price. And investors are sometimes willing to pay higher multiples for companies with financial and operational bulk. Think of ITT in the 1960s or Tyco and General Electric before the financial crisis.The advantages of size are impressive, but the reasons to divide can also be compelling. Centralised managers find it hard to keep track of diversified businesses, especially when they run into difficulties. Operating heads may not tell the home office about problems and when the troubles are discovered, parachuted managers may be too arrogant or ignorant to provide much help.Even when things are going well, scale has its disadvantages. Big bosses can inspire or make brilliant strategic decisions, but the more mundane gains – from centralised purchasing, common safety standards or a unified approach to human resources – require bureaucracies. These can easily tip from aids to obstructions.Then there is contamination. News Corp, a global media conglomerate, is suffering from reputational damage caused by one of its smallest parts, the declining UK newspaper operation. Operational contamination – more specifically the desire to reduce it – played a big role in the Motorola split, which effectively frees a good business from a bad one. Of course, split-off businesses can also get into trouble, as Cable & Wireless has demonstrated.Financial considerations can also make less into more. In a negative way, the separation of bad businesses from good ones keeps companies from throwing good money after bad. More positively, investors sometimes pay up for purer plays and discount impure mélanges, so there can be shareholder value in dividing four into two and two.Of course, sometimes investors will go the other way, and make two and two into five. That possibility, along with the unwillingness of most managers to preside over a smaller empire (is it entirely an accident that the chairman and chief executive of ConocoPhillips is retiring after the break-up?) mean that there are fewer splits than there should be. But the recent trend has encouraged some shareholders to think more boldly, for example suggesting BP try a ConocoPhillips-style break-up. Such ideas should not be rejected out of hand.Tony Jackson is away.

261;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-29T19:37:31Z;BP investors impatient over lack of momentum;;There was not much to excite the market in BP’s second-quarter earnings this week, but after 12 months of being in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, a rather dull set of numbers was welcome news for the UK oil group.Earnings for the quarter of $5.3bn compared well with those for the same period a year ago, when BP reported a loss of $17bn after tax in the wake of the disastrous spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Production, however, was down, mainly due to the continued lack of drilling in the gulf.The comparison may have been good – BP’s balance sheet is healthy once again and its dividend restored – but investors want more, and faster. With BP’s share price still trading below the level it was at before last year’s accident, shareholders are getting impatient. Several top 15 shareholders contacted by the Financial Times after the results expressed their frustration with what they said was a lack of momentum. Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP’s chairman, is also under scrutiny. “There is a view that he is not providing sufficient leadership, direction or urgency,” said one well-informed investor.Some want BP to adopt a “shrink-to-grow” strategy and keep on selling assets. Analysts have also focused on whether it should follow the example of ConocoPhillips and split off its refining and marketing arm.Bob Dudley, chief executive, said on Tuesday they were well aware of investors’ impatience. He hinted the company was further ahead in its thinking than it has so far made public.
262;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-28T16:35:08Z;Exxon/Shell: high on gas;Both are patiently showing the value of long-term investment;"Few industries show the value of long-term investing as starkly as oil and gas. Few oil producers are as good at it as ExxonMobil or Royal Dutch Shell. Investors might retort that Exxon still has to prove that its $31bn purchase of natural gas group XTO Energy will be value for money, or that Shell has taken forever to put the reserves scandal behind it. But as second-quarter results from the two supermajors demonstrated on Thursday, it pays to be patient.The two are the most alike of the integrated oil majors – and arguably have less reason than any of their rivals to split along the lines of ConocoPhillips. As big gas producers – Shell’s upstream division is split about half and half between oil and gas – their downstream activities should be more strategically valuable, and are more integrated and streamlined than at their peers. Neither Exxon nor Shell can duck the question that ConocoPhillips is raising by splitting its downstream and upstream into separate listed entities. But the dilemma looks less urgent than at, say, BP or Eni.Gas is likely to drive earnings growth for both of them. Despite the technical problems posed by shale gas, XTO should work out for Exxon, while Shell’s huge bets on Qatar – both the $19bn Pearl gas-to-liquids facility and Qatargas – are coming on stream and about to start paying their way. Qatar should be firing on all cylinders by this year’s second half; it will ultimately provide about 10 per cent of Shell’s earnings, production and capital employed.For both, the main problem is to find a use for their mountains of cash. Exxon generated operating cash flow of nearly $13bn in the second quarter and lifted its dividend 7 per cent. Shell had operating cash flow of over $12bn and left its pay-out unchanged. Both could hand more cash back to shareholders. But both are also patiently showing the value of long-term investment.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
263;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Shell says age of cheap oil and gas is over;;The time of low-cost oil and gas is at an end and the world is entering a stage where finding resources will be more “complex” and require more money and investment, according to the head of Europe’s biggest oil company.Peter Voser, chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, said the longer-term trend was for higher costs. “In the longer-term, you will clearly need higher oil and gas prices, or energy prices.”Mr Voser was speaking as Shell unveiled second-quarter profits of $8bn, an increase of more than 77 per cent from the same period the year before, buoyed by higher crude prices of more than $110 a barrel.Excluding one-off items, the current cost of supply income, a measure that strips out the value of inventory, was $6.6bn – the highest earnings for the second quarter since Shell’s record year in 2008 when it earned $8.6bn in the same period. First contributions from its new flagship projects in Canada and Qatar also buoyed earnings.Production for the quarter was 3.04m barrels of oil equivalent per day, 2 per cent lower than in the second quarter in 2010. However, excluding the impact of divestments, it was 2 per cent higher.Analysts said evidence of strong, growing cash flow – $10bn for the quarter – should help underpin an increase in dividends or possible share buy-backs in the future. The declared quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share was unchanged from the same period last year. Shares in Shell closed down 0.22 per cent to £22.60 in London.Mr Voser said Shell was not considering following the example of US company ConocoPhillips and breaking itself into two parts, a refining and marketing part and an exploration and production business.“We are a company driving value between the upstream and the downstream through technology and innovation,” he said.Shell has been investing heavily in new projects. Net capital spending from 2011 to 2014 is expected to be at least $100bn. The first half of the year saw the start-up of three of its biggest that will be expected to contribute peak production of more than 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.In Canada’s oil sands, the company started up the 100,000 barrels per day expansion of the Scotford Upgrader, which will continue to ramp up through the year.In Qatar, the company’s Qatargas 4 project, which came on stream during the first quarter is now fully ramped up with a capacity of 7.8m tonnes per year of liquefied natural gas. Shell’s new gas-to-liquids Pearl project in the country has sold its first shipment.The company sanctioned nine new projects this year, which are part of its “project flow that underpin Shell’s upstream production targets of 3.7m boe/day in 2014,” said Mr Voser.● A 50:50 joint venture of Canary Wharf Group and Qatari Diar has been chosen to re-develop the 5.25 acre site of Shell centre at South Bank. The aggregate payment of £300m is conditional on planning permission and the development will be mixed use. The well-known, 1950s, 27-storey tower in the middle of the centre will be preserved and retained by Shell.
264;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-28T03:44:55Z;ConocoPhillips earnings slip in solid quarter;;ConocoPhillips, the US oil company which announced plans to split in two earlier this month by spinning off its refining and marketing business next year, has reported a drop in second quarter profits compared with a year earlier when asset sales boosted its performance.The company, the third biggest oil producer in the US, reported earnings of $3.4bn, down from $4.2bn in the second quarter a year earlier.“We had a solid quarter,” said Jim Mulva, chairman and chief executive officer. “Higher adjusted earnings and cash flow were driven by better commodity prices and refining margins.”The company announced on July 14 it plans to separate its refining and marketing holdings into a new publicly traded company in the first half of next year. Mr Mulva, who will retire when the formal separation takes place, said at the time that the rationale was to unlock shareholder value in an intensely competitive industry. The best way of achieving this, he said, was by dividing the two halves of the business – refining and marketing and exploration and production – and allowing each to focus exclusively on its own priorities and investment ambitions.The upstream company will be the largest pure-play oil and gas exploration and production business in the US. Production growth will come from investments in areas including unconventional resource plays, natural gas and liquefied natural gas.“We believe our investors will see significant long-term benefit from this repositioning, and we look forward to providing additional information about the transaction in September,” said Mr Mulva on Wednesday.The company’s decision has been welcomed by several long-term industry watchers and analysts, many of whom believe the integrated model of the major oil companies is no longer adding value. BP in particular, which on Tuesday reported second quarter profits below analyst expectations, has come under scrutiny.ConocoPhillip’s production for the second quarter of 2011 was 1.64m barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, a decrease of approximately 90,000 boe per day versus the same period in 2010.“Upstream operated well and we are seeing the benefits of our focus on margins and returns,” said Mr Mulva. “While our production fell, the earnings impact was limited as we shifted production from North American natural gas toward higher margin production of oil sands, lower 48 [states] liquids and LNG.”ConocoPhillips shares were up 0.82 per cent to $74.21 a share in early morning trading in New York. It is the first of the US oil companies to report second-quarter earnings. ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil group, will release its results on Thursday, followed by Chevron on July 29.
265;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-26T20:33:59Z;BP disappoints with dip in production;;"BP has sought to reassure shareholders about its strategic direction following worse than expected second-quarter profits.Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, declared that the board of the oil major felt “a great sense of urgency” to unlock value for shareholders following the company’s lacklustre financial performance this year.He refused to rule out splitting BP into two by spinning off its refining and marketing business, as some analysts have suggested, but stressed that the company would not have “a knee-jerk reaction to suggestions in the market”.“We must get the foundations right,” he said, adding that 2011 was always expected to be “a year of consolidation” to reset the company in the wake of last year’s Gulf of Mexico spill.Mr Dudley’s comments came as BP reported a replacement cost profit, a measure that strips out the value of inventory, of $5.3bn (£3.3bn) for the quarter, compared with a loss of $17bn in the same period last year but below analyst expectations.Production of oil and gas in the quarter was 3.43m barrels of oil equivalent per day, a drop of 11 per cent from the same period last year, primarily reflecting the loss of higher margin barrels in the Gulf of Mexico, where BP has so far not secured any new drilling permits. BP’s shares fell 2.55 per cent to 463.26p in London. “They are in limboland,” said one UK-based shareholder. “In my view, they are waiting for news on the investigation by the Department of Justice, but they should be more transparent in their tramlines, what are the options.”The failure of the proposed alliance with Rosneft, the Russian state oil champion, to explore in the Arctic earlier this year has also unnerved investors. Several analysts have recently suggested BP follow the lead of US group ConocoPhillips and split itself into two parts.Mr Dudley stressed BP was aware of investors’ impatience but the company needed to embed the right safety processes and new structures.Iain Conn, BP’s head of refining and marketing, said that while BP would look at all options, its downstream business was different from that of ConocoPhillips; BP’s business was “more global and had quite significant areas of growth”.BP said it would grow operating cash faster than production and that new projects would add production of up to 1m barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2016. Mr Dudley promised that “the momentum of our recovery” would build in 2012 and 2013 as it returned to work in the Gulf of Mexico and uncertainties were reduced. “We will temper the desire for urgency with a dose of realistic progress as we renew,” he said."
266;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-26T15:32:48Z;BP: not drowning or waving;Oil giant must convince investors it has a transformation strategy;"BP is no longer drowning, but it is not exactly waving, either. Bob Dudley helped to save the oil company from going under in the Gulf of Mexico. Since he unveiled the ill-fated alliance with Rosneft in January, however, BP’s share price has retreated 8 per cent. That includes Tuesday’s 2 per cent hit after a half-year earnings miss.If he is to close a wide valuation gap with its peers, Mr Dudley must convince investors that he has a strategy to quicken the transformation of post-Macondo BP. Macondo was a tragedy. Yet it is less of a strategic nightmare now than it was even six months ago. BP has taken a charge of $41bn for the leak, including a $20bn compensation trust fund that is starting – given the level of claims – to look significantly over-funded. About half of the provisioned spill costs have already been incurred. Yet BP shareholders are still nursing $77bn of lost value since the leak versus the company’s European peers alone, according to HSBC estimates. Assuming a final bill of $30bn – after a trust fund refund of $6bn and contributions from other parties to the leak – that leaves BP’s board with a $47bn dilemma.When negotiating the Rosneft alliance, Mr Dudley made a tactical error by underestimating BP’s Russian oligarch partners in TNK-BP. That does not mean he was wrong to bypass them. BP looked becalmed in Russia before the Rosneft deal; it looks even more so now. Mr Dudley should look to start exiting TNK-BP through a stock market listing; analysts’ sum-of-the-parts calculations value the 50 per cent stake at $25bn. And he should not stop there. ConocoPhillips reopens the break-up argument for Big Oil. Mr Dudley should take that argument seriously, or risk squandering the tragic opportunity provided by Macondo for BP to reinvent itself.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
267;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-18T18:31:26Z;Integrated oil groups;Separating upstream and downstream operations is the way forward;"Break me up before you go-go. Jim Mulva’s parting shot as chairman and chief executive of ConocoPhillips was to proclaim the end of the era of the integrated oil company. Conoco is splitting into its downstream and upstream divisions, in the name of creating shareholder value. Investors have not rushed to join any putative trend: the sector share price reaction has been muted. But the pressure to improve lacklustre shareholder returns could yet change that.The integrated model used to have a huge advantage: it guaranteed access to resources. That is no longer the case. It now has a pressing disadvantage: it has conceded integrated companies’ stock market premium to nimbler pure-play upstream operators. Marathon was the first integrated group to address this: its split has replaced one company valued by the market at $23bn with two companies worth a combined $36bn.It is hard to see a ruthlessly streamlined and integrated behemoth such as ExxonMobil imitating this strategy. Other groups, however, should be learning lessons; European integrated oil groups in particular. UBS estimates that they trade at an average 19 per cent discount to net asset value.Some of these companies are accidents of history. Italy’s Eni controls oil services group Saipem as well as gas and power distribution. That model would not be created today. Meanwhile, BP’s effort to close its post-Macondo 30 per cent discount to NAV is not working: its total return this year is a measly 3 per cent.The integrated model has the status of a creation myth for many oil executives. That sells their investors short. Marathon set the ball rolling by completely separating upstream and downstream. Conoco is big enough to make a big difference. A sector long on cash and short on ideas needs to be bold enough to embrace and follow their lead.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
268;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-15T21:46:07Z;Bullish Google results eases battered sentiment;;US stocks ended fractionally higher on Friday, paring overall losses for the week. Strong results from Google and Citigroup finally managed to overshadow contentious negotiations on the US debt ceiling and a drop in consumer confidence.Google soared 13 per cent to $597.62 after a strong earnings report that exceeded the most bullish estimates. It was the stock’s biggest one-day gain in nearly three years.Year-on-year revenues were up by almost third, and adjusted earnings per share rose 36 per cent. The growth was driven by strength in the core search business and by newer operations, such as its social network Google Plus, a potential Facebook competitor.Citigroupshares fell 1.6 per cent to $38.38 despite releasing positive results before the opening bell. The banking group’s profits rose 24 per cent in the second quarter, with a net income of $3.3bn, or $1.09 a share.The strong results helped investors to shrug off a fresh warning by Standard & Poor’s that the US’s triple A credit rating could be in danger of a downgrade if lawmakers did not agree to extend the debt ceiling by August 2. It follows a similar warning earlier this week by Moody’s Investor Services.The benchmark S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,316.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent to 12,479.73. The Dow closed at a low for the month on Thursday, losing ground in four of the previous five sessions.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also closed in positive territory, up 1 per cent at 2,789.80.But Friday’s gains only eased the week’s losses. The S&P closed off by 2.1 per cent for the week, while the Dow fell 1.4 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 2.5 per cent over the week.Weighing on Wall Street for the week were financial groups, whose shares fell 3.9 per cent. Financials are the only S&P 500 sector down for the year, some 7 per cent lower. Yet, good earning numbers do not seem to provide strong support for financial equities.JPMorgan Chase extended its losses on Friday, down 0.9 per cent to $39.98 on Friday, to nearly 2 per cent on the week. The heavyweight bank failed to cheer investors by exceeding its second-quarter earnings forecasts on Thursday. After a sluggish week, Bank of America also ended lower by 0.6 per cent at $10 on Friday, off 6.5 per cent on the week.News Corp added 1.3 per cent on Friday to $15.64, though it was still down 6.7 per cent on the week.It has been a rocky period for the global media giant led by Rupert Murdoch. This week has seen the the closure of the News of the World, Mr Murdoch’s UK newspaper, and the withdrawal of News Corp’s planned bid to take full control of British Sky Broadcasting.Overall, macro issues have dominated investors’ sentiment, including issues such as the US’s debt ceiling, monetary policy and the fallout from eurozone sovereign debt woes. “The market bias is downward. Sometimes in the next few weeks we will see the market struggling because of the lack of good news,” said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, has risen this month from a low of 15 on July 1. On Friday, the index was hovering just below 20, the critical level that indicates elevated market stress.Energy was the only sector not to decline on the week, ekeing out a 0.1 per cent gain. Energy stocks were up sharply on Friday following deal news, rising 2.3 per cent.Petrohawk Energy, the gas producer, was up 62 per cent to $38.17 after Australian miner BHP Billiton announced an agreement to buy the group for $12.1bn.That led to a surge for other gas producers that analysts said could be future buy-out targets. Range Resourcesled all gainers in energy, up 12.1 per cent at $61.78, followed by Pioneer Naturalup 10.4 per cent at $95.03.Analysts at Credit Suisse said that the Petrohawk deal “supports premium valuations” for other domestic exploration firms, including Range. Such groups are “basin pure plays that could be potential acquisition targets”, they said.ConocoPhillipswas up 1.1 per cent at $76.42 on Friday. The company’s shares have been boosted after it announced plans on Thursday to split its refining and production businesses.Clorox, the consumer products company, hit an all-time high on Friday after Carl Icahn, the billionaire shareholder activist, made a $12.6bn offer to buy the group, or $76.50 a share. The shares jumped 8.9 per cent to $74.55 on Friday.
269;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConocoPhillips splits in two;;ConocoPhillips decided in principle to split in two on Thursday, announcing a plan to divide its refining business and exploration and production assets into separate corporations.Less than a decade after the original merger between Conoco and Phillips Petroleum produced the third biggest oil company by production in the US, the company’s board decided to break up their creation.Jim Mulva, the chief executive who will retire when the formal separation takes place next year, said the rationale was to unlock shareholder value in an intensely competitive industry. The best way of achieving this, he said, was by dividing the two halves of the business and allowing each to focus exclusively on its own priorities and investment ambitions.But analysts said that the downstream arm of ConocoPhillips had underperformed its counterparts in exploration and production. The company’s name will continue to attach to the new upstream company, meaning that Mr Mulva has in effect chosen to hive off the refining side of the business, which was shaping up to become a significant drag.Michael Hill, co-head of natural resources at Nomura, pointed out that the new exploration and production company would be relieved of the capital burden of upgrading old refineries.The market rewarded Mr Mulva by sending ConocoPhillips shares up by 1.6 per cent after his announcement. But his successor will face the challenge of running a company much reduced in size, while also achieving growth against the fierce competition of its bigger peers.
270;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-14T22:31:55Z;Betfair stumbles after offshore tax threat;;Betfair was under pressure in a falling London market on Thursday amid tax fears.Shares in the FTSE 250-listed betting exchange fell after the government said online gaming companies based offshore would need a domestic licence to take bets from UK customers.The proposed change “lays the foundation for potential taxation”, said JPMorgan Cazenove analysts. “The clearest current advantage for offshore operators is the avoidance of the 15 per cent gross profits tax applicable to onshore gaming profits and therefore we think that an offshore tax in line with onshore may be in the pipeline,” they said.Betfair would be exposed to such a tax, having relocated its official headquarters to Gibraltar in March to save about £20m a year. The stock, down 3.4 per cent to 682p, has nearly halved since its flotation in October.Investec estimated that a 15 per cent tax would cost Betfair two-thirds of its annual profits to April 2013. The financial and structural impact may be even greater if Betfair has to apply a horseracing levy on customers’ winnings, it added.The wider market registered its fourth decline in five days. The FTSE 100 slipped 1 per cent or 59.48 points to reach a two-week closing low of 5,846.95.InterContinental Hotels dropped 3.2 per cent to £12.41 after earnings from Marriott International missed expectations.Man Group lost 2.1 per cent to 240½p after HSBC downgraded the hedge fund manager to “underweight”.The weak performance of Man’s benchmark AHL fund in the year to date will lead to a “material slowdown” in sales over the next few months, and investors were too optimistic about performance fees based on the fund recovering next year, HSBC said. Its 2012 earnings forecast was 24 per cent below consensus estimates.BAE Systems, the recent subject of takeover talk, lost 0.9 per cent to 303p after JPMorgan Cazenove recommended switching into Rolls-Royce, which took on 1.2 per cent to 659p.Lloyds Banking Group was the top performer among financial stocks following an upgrade to “buy” late on Wednesday from Goldman Sachs. Friday’s stress test results could be a positive catalyst, the broker said, helping the shares rise 3.2 per cent to 45¾p.Tobacco companies were in focus amid talk of potential consolidation. One rumour was that British American Tobacco, down 0.5 per cent to £27.78, could take advantage of its relative premium by making an all-share offer for Imperial Tobacco, flat at £21.41.BP edged 0.3 per cent higher at 458p on the news that ConocoPhillips would separate its upstream and downstream businesses, an option many believe BP should also pursue.Shire was up 1.3 per cent to £20.73 as both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended the drugmaker ahead of its results due July 28. US prescription data pointed to Shire’s key hyperactivity market exceeding expectations, Goldman said.Petrofac was weakest among the blue-chips, losing 3.8 per cent to £14.45, after Barclays Capital turned negative on the oil services engineer.Thomas Cook dropped a further 15.6 per cent to 71¼p, leaving the stock down 42 per cent since Tuesday, when a profit warning sparked concerns it might breach banking covenants. “We think it is too early to conclude [Thomas Cook] needs equity,” said Morgan Stanley. “But we think a dividend cut (leading to further share price pressure given the income fund contingent) and a tough discussion with its banks are likely.”Daily Mail & General Trust dropped 4.1 per cent to 421¼p after warning it would raise the weekday cover price of its newspaper to counter worsening advertising sales. The news sent Johnston Press, the regional newspapers group, sliding 8.7 per cent to 5¼p.
271;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-14T22:22:37Z;Wall St stocks fall amid default concerns;;Wall Street stocks closed down after an early equity rally amid concern that US politicians may fail to agree on raising the US debt ceiling, which could lead to a catastrophic default, and as investors reassessed the likelihood of the Federal Reserve’s embarking on “quantitative easing”.In spite of initial efforts to look away from the possibility of Moody’s downgrading the US debt, equities pulled back after modest morning gains. Relatively good economic news and JPMorgan Chase beating earnings estimates initially helped investors gain confidence. JPMorgan Chase, the first big bank to report results, was up 1.84 per cent at $40.35 after announcing that its second-quarter profits rose 13 per cent to $5.4bn or $1.27 a share, in net income.“Bernanke’s comments took away the enthusiasm. The market reacted, as it is very much focused on negotiations in Washington”, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4 per cent at 12,437.12, after climbing almost 90 points early in the session, when investors were focused on the heavyweight bank’s growth. Financials, one of the worst performing sectors, are under pressure to show that they can increase revenue. Citigroup is due to release earnings on Friday.“But there were some good news in the retail sales and employment fronts, and good numbers from JPMorgan pushed it up a little initially. All in all, this is still a very cautious market looking at debt issues, both in Europe and the US, and the corporate earnings season”, Ms Krosby said.According to the US Commerce Department, retail sales rose 0.1 per cent in June, after dipping 0.1 per cent in May, while weekly jobless claims dropped 22,000 to 405,000, compared to an expected figure of 415,000.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was in negative territory, down 1.2 per cent at 2,762.67 and the benchmark S&P 500 also closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,308.87. All of the S&P sectors lost ground, closing in negative territory.Yet ConocoPhillips was one of the S&P top performers at 1.6 per cent to $75.61, after an early announcement that the company plans to split its refining and production businesses into two different publicly traded companies.“We estimate the value range on a split-up is between $73 and $92 per share. Essentially, we see little downside to owning the stock at current levels. Overall, we estimate we can comfortably get to $80 per share on a break-up value,” said Faisel Khan, analyst with Citi investment research.“It remains to be seen how ConocoPhillips will deal with the downstream, how it will allocate the midstream and chemicals business among the separated company, whether there will be dis-synergies and most importantly how the upstream business will be valued. The upstream valuation is the key component here,” he added.Yum! Brands, reached an all-time high at $57.75 before paring its gains at 1.4 per cent to $56.37. On Wednesday, the US fast food Restaurant Group, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, reported a 10 per cent gain in profits, or $0.65 per share, in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations and raising its full-year forecast. According to the company’s chief executive, David Novak, profit was helped by “strong performance in China and other emerging markets”, with sales in China growing more than 18 per cent.“Outlook for consolidated fundamentals are probably coming down slightly, with upside in China not fully offsetting weakness in the US. That said, Yum! is making the case for multiple expansion, which should be more important for the shares,” said Keith Siegner, an analyst with Credit Suisse.Google closed down 1.7 per cent to $528.94, but jumped as earnings results, released after the closing bell, exceeded estimates. The search engine group’s shares rose 12.5 per cent to $595.25 in after-hours trading.After hitting all-time high of $304.80 in early trading in the previous session Netflix, the DVD subscription and streaming video company, tumbled to $286.62, down 4.1 per cent. The company’s move to overhaul its pricing policy aimed at pushing users toward its growing streaming service has received criticisms and alienated some users.The microchip sub-sector was down with Microchip Technology, a chipmaker, down 1.2 per cent at $32.01 after reporting lower sales, and Novellus, a manufacturer of equipment for chipmakers, was also down 1.3 per cent at $31.58.Again, in the spotlight, News Corp tumbled 3.1 per cent at $15.43, following news the FBI opened an investigation into allegations that the media giant also hacked into the phones of September 11 victims. Also on Thursday, Rupert Murdoch and his son James, were summoned to appear before the UK Parliament, as a result of the British newspaper phone-hacking scandal. News Corp pared in the previous session after the company dropped its bid for BSkyB.
272;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-14T19:57:52Z;ConocoPhillips;Supermajor transforms itself into a big fish in a small pond;If at first you don’t succeed, try something else. ConocoPhillips had reformed its old ways, eschewing growth to focus on balance sheet repair and shareholder returns and delivering the highest cash yield (dividends plus buy-backs) of any big western energy company. Even so, it has had the worst total return of US supermajors, year to date.Except for the results, it was hard to fault Conoco’s strategy, but it has now ditched that for the shareholder-friendly move du jour – splitting itself into upstream and downstream businesses, just as smaller rivals Marathon and Murphy Oil did recently to loud stock market applause. Conoco is the first supermajor to attempt this but the initial reaction, a nearly 8 per cent rally, means it may not be the last.So it is converting itself from a small fish in a big pond – certainly the puniest company worthy of the moniker “supermajor” at just a quarter of the value of ExxonMobil and half of Chevron – to the opposite in its new categories. It will be the second largest independent US refiner after Valero and easily the largest pure play exploration and production outfit.Simply applying the average multiples of enterprise value to revenue of its leading peers in each category, 0.24 and 4.3 times, respectively, suggests a tantalising composite market value of around $200bn for Conoco, an 85 per cent premium to today’s price. That is too optimistic, but it highlights the discount accorded to Big Oil.Whether or not the sum of the parts really is greater than the whole, this is what the market believes and perception is reality. But shareholders in other supermajors should recognise that the “big” in Big Oil is still a virtue, even if integration is not. Even more than in the heyday of the Seven Sisters era, upstream projects are capital-intensive and risky.Those pushing for more supermajor splits should not expect a similar pay-off either, as Conoco was the most integrated of the integrateds, and too cheap to boot. Less is more, but not much more.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
273;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Shrink-to-grow strategy at heart of Conoco break up;;For years, Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, believed that bigger was better. He oversaw the original merger between Conoco and Phillips that created one of the world’s five largest oil and gas companies. And then he kept on buying.Yet by early 2009, the US economic downtown had exposed the flaws in this strategy. ConocoPhillips disclosed a net loss of $31.8bn in the last quarter of 2008 after a $34bn writedown, together with 1,300 job losses.Praveen Kumar, finance professor at the University of Houston, explained that rising commodity prices had disguised the structural changes taking place in the oil and gas industry. Gaining access to hydrocarbon reserves was becoming ever harder with maturing fields, the rise of resource nationalism and tougher competition from national oil companies.The biggest international companies were scrambling to buy whatever they could, whether it was oil sands in Canada, deepwater fields off the Brazilian coast or shale gas in the US. But all these assets were more expensive to develop and had longer lead times. It had become harder for ConocoPhillips to keep up with its much bigger peers.Mr Mulva duly revised his strategy. First, he stopped buying assets. Then he decided to sell some, fixing a goal of $17bn of disposals by 2012.Now he has chosen to hive off ConocoPhillip’s refining and marketing operation so that the company can focus on exploration and production.“ConocoPhillips has been restructuring its portfolio in an attempt to release shareholder value for the past 18 months,’’ said Fraser McKay, senior corporate analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy. “This is by far the most dramatic event of that period.’’Shareholders have rewarded Mr Mulva for each of his decisions. The shrink-to-grow strategy caused the ConocoPhillips share price to outperform its peers over the past year. The decision to split the company into two new entities led its shares to surge to on Thursday.But Mr McKay cautioned that this did not mean other big oil companies would follow suit. “You’ve got to look at it holistically – a company’s size, scale and the number of businesses it has,’’ he said. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all model.’’That said, Marathon Oil hived off its refining operation two weeks ago – and was rewarded with a surging share price.But analysts note that Marathon and ConocoPhillips were among the smallest of the big integrated companies. The biggest players may have assessed the case for hiving off their refining and marketing operations, but this does not mean they will do the same.“BP has been looking at this,” said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. “But although Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron have rationalised their portfolios, they are staying in the refining business.”These companies continue to believe in the synergies of being in both key segments of the oil business, he said.If they shrink too much, companies risk losing the hedges provided by diversified portfolios. This is particularly important for the exploration and production business, which is exposed to multiple risks, notably the volatility of commodity prices, environmental accidents and the expropriation of assets by foreign governments.The biggest benefit from splitting, said Mr McKay, was allowing companies to focus more clearly on the needs and investments of individual entities. And investors favour this option, he said, because it enables them to decide for themselves how much exposure to refining they want versus exploration and production.The challenge for ConocoPhillips, as an independent, will be its reduced size. Yet Barclays Capital estimates that it will still have more than twice the proven reserves of Occidental Petroleum and Apache, its new peers. Meanwhile, its refining operation will be the second biggest among US independents.“This will be `the super-independent’. But the key to a successful independent is the ability to grow,’’ said Mr West. “Eventually Conoco will have to grow the business.”
274;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-14T15:12:57Z;ConocoPhillips unveils break-up plan;;ConocoPhillips, America’s third largest integrated oil company, will hive off its refining assets to focus exclusively on exploration and production.ConocoPhillips announced on Thursday that it will split into two publicly traded entities, spinning off its refining and marketing business by the first half of next year.ConocoPhillips shares rose 7.5 per cent after the announcement. Shares in Marathon Oil have also surged since it announced a similar plan two weeks ago.This marks the second attempt by Jim Mulva, chief executive, to restructure the company, following an earlier acquisition spree. ConocoPhillips is the smallest of the six oil majors.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mulva argued that the company’s refining operations were a drag on the upstream division, especially in the face of increased competition from state-owned oil giants. “[The split] is a result of more and more competition,” he said. “The opportunities to continue to grow as we have in the last ten years have changed dramatically [for the worse].”“The downstream business is really struggling as an industry and the model is all about taking out costs and finding efficiencies,” said Jim DeNaut, Nomura’s head of investment banking for the Americas. “That is very different from the …growth that is going on in the upstream part of the business.”The restructuring will transform ConocoPhillips into a “super independent”, with what Barclays Capital estimates will be more than twice the proved reserves of Occidental Petroleum and Apache, its new peers.The spun-off refining operations will be slightly smaller than Valero Energy’s, making it the US’s second biggest independent refiner.“The cost of upgrading refineries and the potential environmental liabilities …can become a significant drain on capital that could otherwise go to growing the upstream business,” said Michael Hill, Nomura’s global co-head of natural resources.The formal separation of ConocoPhillips is expected to take place in the first half of next year, after which Mr Mulva will retire.Under the terms of the present plan, no shareholder vote would be needed for the separation to proceed. Instead, it would be subject to regulatory approvals and a final decision from the board.ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, has a global portfolio of exploration and refining assets, including a joint venture in the North Sea’s Britannia oilfield.
275;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-06T16:38:58Z;Ukraine, wary of Russia, seeks energy independence with $1.5bn gas plant;;"Ukraine on Wednesday made a serious move towards cutting its energy dependence on Russia by formally inviting potential investors to prepare studies on building the country’s first LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant.Located on the Black Sea, it would be a gateway for gas from the Black Sea region and beyond. But, as with many projects in Ukraine, the path from announcement to completion may be long and complicated.Vladyslav Kaskiv, head of Ukraine’s state agency for investment and national projects, said an investor would be chosen by the year-end. He estimated the cost of the LNG plant to be at least $1.5bn.One influential business obligarch rumoured to have an interest in the LNG plant being built is Ukrainian billionaire Dmytro Firtash. He is leading the race to privatise the Odessa Portside plant, a gas guzzling chemical plant which stands near the site where the LNG plant could be built.But the Odessa chemicals group’s privatisation has been repeatedly delayed amid political arguments. If it were again held up, it’s easy to see how the LNG plant plan might also run into the Black Sea sands.However, there’s no doubting Kiev’s new-found determination to finally implement long-discussed proposals for energy diversification – even at the cost of dropping longstanding and informal barriers that have long kept out multinational oil majors.Ukraine has decided that it needs western capital and technology to develop its potentially large shale gas reserves. Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and TNK-BP are among companies said to be eyeing exploration and production licenses.Late last month, Vadim Chuprun, deputy energy minister, said “ExxonMobil, Halliburton, ConocoPhillips, Shell and other companies” have “responded to our proposals.”Parliament late last month adopted legislation on production sharing agreements set by potential investors as a precondition.“According to US Geological Survey studies, we have at least 1.5-2.5 trillion cubic meters of shale gas. This number is approximate and will obviously grow,” Mr Chuprun added.The reserves are believed to be located in two major pockets: one close Ukraine’s border with Poland; another in the east.They, along with offshore prospects on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, could significantly diversify Ukraine’s supplies, cutting into the sales export sales of Russia’s Gazprom. Importing 40bn-50 billion cubic meters of gas in recent years, Ukraine is currently Gazprom’s largest customer.Russia has long covered the majority of Ukraine’s gas needs, but Ukraine is seeking new supplies after its northern neighbour has quadrupled prices since 2004.Referring to the LNG project and the potential of shale schemes, Kaskiv said: “These projects could help Europe at large diversify energy supplies and get energy at more competitive prices.”The world’s largest energy companies have long fancied opportunities in Ukraine, but local officials have largely kept them out, preserving control over the domestic energy sector in the hands of oligarchs and Russian groups.But Jorge Zukoski, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine says Ukraine is now expressing a “clear intention to open up the energy sector to reputable international companies.”“We are talking about multibillion investments,” Zukoski says. Late last month, TNK-BP said it alone planned to invest $1.8bn in Ukraine shale gas exploration. “We hope to see the first tender announcement by the end of this year,” Zukoski said.As well as the clear commercial advantages of energy diversification, Ukraine could boost its public revenues (by taxing the new enterprises) and broaden its international political ties by working more closely with companies from the US and the European Union.But to do that, these schemes must come to fruition. And for that to happen Kiev needs to deliver a consistent energy policy and to implement it – something it has struggle to do in the past.Related reading:

276;COP;Conocophillips;2011-07-06T09:45:41Z;Cover-up culture: China’s hidden oil spill raises murky questions;;"What if the Deepwater Horizon oil spill had taken place in China? It’s not an idle question: China is stepping up efforts to tap its offshore resources, which contain between a quarter and a third of the country’s oil and gas reserves.However a recent oil spill in the Bohai Bay – that was subsequently covered up for nearly a month – has prompted a new fear: Could a major oil spill happen in China and never even be reported at all?The Bohai Bay spill seems to have narrowly avoided just such a fate. The first oil leak was spotted on June 4 and operators say they promptly reported it to the government; a second leak was reported on June 17.However the spill wasn’t reported to the public until nearly a month later, when it was revealed in an expose by the Chinese newspaper Southern Weekend.The well is operated by ConocoPhillips, and majority owned by Cnooc, China’s biggest offshore oil producer.Descriptions of what happened at the site bring a certain sense of déjà vu. As Cnooc put it in a Wednesday statement:“A seepage of oil from the seabed was found near the Platform B in early June. It is the first of its kind occurred in China and the cause is still subject to further study and analysis. It was also observed in mid June that one well being drilled in Platform C occurred a small-scale influx, resulting in another oil spill. . . .According to the statement of the [State Oceanic Administration] the above incidents have certain impact on the marine environment. . . resulting in about 840 square kilometers of seawater worse than Grade IV. Through those measures taken by the Operator such as reducing pressure in Platform B and implementing a cementing procedure in Platform C, the above incidents were well controlled on June 19 and 21 respectively.As of July 4, there is no obvious oil slick on the sea surface. Only very small amount of oil sheen can be observed occasionally near Platform B and C.”Chinese authorities say that an investigation has found ConocoPhillips at fault and the company will be fined at least Rmb200,000 ($31,000).Although neither the companies nor the government have given an estimate for how much oil was released into the ocean by the two spills, reports in coastal Shandong, which is as close as 40km to the well in some places, say local fishermen have noticed unusual numbers of dead fish.“My revenue last month was more than 50,000 yuan less compared with same period of last year,” a Shandong fisherman told the state-owned Jiefang Daily. Media outcry prompted the government to hold a press conference on Tuesday—the first official acknowledgment of the spill—where officials said a cleanup was underway and that the causes of the spill were being investigated.Chinese state-owned media, traditionally reluctant to criticize the government, have railed against the cover up. An editorial in the Global Times said:“We cannot help but wonder: Is the [State Oceanic Administration] a serious watchdog that exists to prevent bigger incidents from happening, or a loving parent who is over-protective of his own child? . . it is not acceptable that the [State Oceanic Administration], which had learned about the incident in early June, hold the news until a month later.”Although the oil slicks may be largely dispersed by now, the challenge for China remains: in an atmosphere of low transparency and little disclosure, how can industrial accidents and environmental disasters be dealt with?As Cnooc and others keep expanding their deepwater drilling in China, the import of that question will only grow.Related reading:

277;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Strong balance sheets help fuel US buy-backs;;US companies are buying back their own stock at the fastest pace since 2007, a trend that is helping maintain the resilience of the broad market.Strong company balance sheets, a shortage of profitable investment opportunities and low interest rates are helping drive the latest surge in stock buy-backs.The return of “de-equitisation” in 2011 comes after activity plunged in 2009 as companies conserved cash and cut dividends during the financial crisis.“Corporate buying has been the main determinant of direction of the stock market in recent years,” said Smithers & Co. “The ratio of cash to debt has been a significant leading indicator of corporate buying and continues to improve.”On Tuesday, Best Buy, the vast consumer electronics retailer, was the latest company to announce plans to buy back its stock with a $5bn share repurchase plan.“Companies have paid down a lot debt and it’s cheap to borrow money and buy back stock,” said Rob Leiphart, analyst at Birinyi Associates. “Buy-backs offer companies a lot of flexibility in terms of deploying capital, versus dividends.”So far this year, buy-backs have totalled $274bn versus $189bn by mid-June in 2010, according to Birinyi Associates.That has the market on course for its best year since 2007’s total of $863bn and 2006’s $655bn.On Tuesday, Best Buy, as well as setting its share repurchase plan, also raised its quarterly dividend 7 per cent.Its new plan replaces an existing $5.5bn programme that was announced in 2007 and had $800m left.Shares in Best Buy rose 2.9 per cent to $32.45 after the news.Analysts at Credit Suisse said the $5bn authorisation could see Best Buy purchase about 40 per cent of its outstanding shares.The bank estimated that the buy-back could add $0.60 to earnings per share if it ended by the end of next year, placing EPS for 2012 close to $4.50 versus an expected $3.45 for 2011.“We believe the company can fund much of it with the $4bn in free cash flow we expect it to generate over that period,” said Credit Suisse.So far this year, Walt Disney leads the way with a $16bn buy-back plan, followed by JPMorgan Chase at $15bn, with Intel and ConocoPhillips having announced $10bn programmes.Healthcare leads sectors with $49bn in buy-backs this year, followed by financials at $45bn and consumer discretionary companies at $43bn.All three sectors have exceeded their buy-backs for the same time in 2010. In contrast, the consumer staples sector lags with $18bn in buy-backs this year versus $42bn in 2010.
278;COP;Conocophillips;2011-06-08T16:45:49Z;India oil groups in talks on Kashagan field;;ONGC and GAIL, the Indian state energy groups, are in talks to buy a stake in Kazakhstan’s giant Kashagan oilfield from ExxonMobil as western oil majors consider reducing their exposure at the troubled Caspian Sea project.Kashagan holds 9bn-12bn barrels of reserves and is being developed by the North Caspian Operating Company, a grouping of ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, ConocoPhillips, Japan’s Inpex and KazMunaigas, the Kazakh state oil company.International oil groups battled for a share in Kashagan in the late 1990s but have since become discouraged by repeated disputes with Kazakhstan over ballooning costs and delays at the field.In the latest battle, Kazakhstan warned NCOC this year that it would not sanction the second phase of Kashagan’s development – designed to boost production to 1m barrels a day – unless the group modified the costs and timetable of the project. A delay at phase two would be a setback for NCOC’s plans to maximise oil production at Kashagan before its contract expires in 2037.ONGC and GAIL said they were in preliminary negotiations jointly to buy part of ExxonMobil’s 16.8 per cent interest in Kashagan. “There are ongoing discussions with Exxon, but it’s preliminary,” A.K. Hazarika, the chairman of ONGC, told the Financial Times on Wednesday. “We’ll know more in the next few weeks.”B.C. Tripathi, the chairman of GAIL, said the gas company was interested in acquiring the Kazakh assets and was working closely with ONGC to close a deal.ExxonMobil declined to comment on the talks on Wednesday. ConocoPhillips is considering selling its stake in Kashagan as part of a broader plan to reduce its overseas portfolio to reduce debt.Dominic Lewenz, oil analyst at Visor Capital, the Kazakh investment bank, said it would be a sacrifice for ExxonMobil to reduce its stake in such a large field as Kashagan. “Big oil is not that easy to find,” he said.Talks between the US group and the Indian companies would be seen as sending “a strong signal to Kazakhstan to give more direction to the project,” he said.Edward Chow, senor fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said oil majors were unlikely to bail out of Kashagan until phase one was completed. “Whoever sells will be in a better position after production begins and they have cash flow and can demonstrate economic value,” he said.Entry to Kashagan would mark a breakthrough for ONGC, which has struggled against financially stronger Chinese groups to secure Kazakh oil assets for more than six years.India’s increasing dependence on energy imports has prompted the government to urge state-run groups to make at least one foreign acquisition by 2012.Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty in Houston
279;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Greenland attacks Greenpeace over protest;;Greenland’s government has angrily criticised Greenpeace for trying to sabotage offshore oil exploration round the Arctic island.Activists from the environmental group on Sunday boarded an oil rig operated by Cairn Energy in an effort to halt the company’s $600m drilling programme.Ove Karl Berthelsen, Greenland’s industry minister, accused Greenpeace of putting lives at risk in “a never-ending hunt for media attention”.He said: “We will not be stopped by Greenpeace’s actions. Greenland has a right to develop the basis of a livelihood for its population.”Greenpeace said it had evaded a Danish patrol vessel early on Sunday to attach a specially-designed survival pod with three activists on board to the underside of the Leiv Eriksson oil rig.The rig was en route to one of seven offshore locations that Greenland’s government has sanctioned for Cairn exploration this summer.Greenpeace is fiercely opposed to fossil fuel exploration in Arctic waters because of the threat to the fragile environment. The activists claim that the extreme weather and remote location would make an eventual accident virtually impossible to halt.Campaigner Ben Ayliffe, speaking by satellite phone from the bridge of the Greenpeace support vessel Esperanza off Greenland, said: “If they had a BP-style blow-out off the coast of Greenland then it would make the Deepwater Horizon clean-up look simple”.London-listed Cairn, which last August recorded the first firm indication of worthwhile oil deposits in Greenland’s waters, says its safety procedures are more than adequate and surpass requirements elsewhere.It said on Sunday: “The Greenland Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum has established some of the most stringent operating regulations anywhere globally, which mirror those applied in the Norwegian North Sea”.Greenpeace has repeatedly called on Cairn to publish a detailed oil spill contingency plan that could be verified by an independent agency.However, it is understood that Greenland authorities have stipulated that these details must be kept confidential.Greenland, which last year won increased independence from Denmark, its former colonial master, has welcomed oil exploration off its coast.Kuupik Kleist, prime minister, said last week: “Exploitation of our enormous riches in oil and mineral resources is indisputably the most promising potential for a greater degree of self-sufficiency at a scale that will secure Greenland’s economic base and our future livelihoods”.Though it has secured some measure of independence from Denmark, Greenland remains dependent on an annual Danish government grant of about DKr3bn ($575m).Greenpeace said on Sunday that the activists suspended below the Leiv Eriksson rig were equipped to stay “for a good long time.”A similar occupation last year ended in embarrassment for Greenpeace when they were forced to ask Cairn to help them to safety from the rig’s pylons.Cairn is just one of several oil operators in Greenland. Exxon, Chevron, Shell, Statoil and ConocoPhillips have all secured licences but Cairn is the only company drilling this year.Data from the US Geological Survey have suggested that the seabed between Greenland and Canada holds approximately 17 billion barrels of oil.
280;COP;Conocophillips;2011-05-29T18:21:58Z;Supermajors seek the right balance;;"As the 20th century drew to a close, the US oil and gas industry went on a buying spree, forming supermajors such as ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips.The idea was to gain economies of scale and hedge against tough times and costs associated with exploration, production and refining. By 2008, rising oil and natural gas prices rewarded them with strong profits.“That increase in oil prices camouflaged or distracted attention away from the structural changes taking place,’” says Praveen Kumar, director of the global energy management institute at the University of Houston.Resources were harder to come by, with maturing fields and the rise of resource nationalism and competition from national oil companies. The supermajors scrambled to buy what they could – Canada’s oil sands, global deepwater, and US shale – all of which were more expensive to develop than conventional resources.“Even if you now have a promising find, the amount of money needed to exploit is higher than in the past,’’ Mr Kumar adds.To fund these projects, companies are now selling non-core, mature or politically risky assets. Several companies have aggressively pursued a shrink to grow strategy. At Exxon’s annual shareholders’ meeting on May 25, investors pressed the company, as they have in the past, for clarity on its future direction.Devon Energy and ConocoPhillips have been rewarded with a rise in their share prices since the start of the year. Even BP, forced by the Macondo disaster in the Gulf of Mexico to sell assets to raise cash, has been rewarded by investors.“We had more opportunities than we could reasonably develop,’’ says John Richels, Devon’s chief executive. “We decided to focus on the biggest piece – 90 per cent of our portfolio was onshore North America.”In November 2009, Devon began selling its international and deepwater assets, hoping to gain up to $7.5bn before taxes; it brought in $10.1bn before taxes. Yet some investors questioned selling oil assets prized in the market.“If you don’t have some sort of competitive advantage, you shouldn’t compete in that area,” Mr Richels says.It is a lesson sometimes forgotten as companies strive to grow. For Paul Sankey, analyst at Deutsche Bank, it raises the question for others in the industry: “Why are you holding on to non-core assets worth more to other companies?”Jim Mulva, Conoco chief executive, admits he was late taking stock. This was driven home when commodity prices fell off their record highs with the downturn in late 2008.In early 2009, Conoco, the third-biggest oil and gas company in the US by production and market capitalisation, disclosed a 2008 fourth-quarter net loss of $31.8bn; a $34bn writedown; 1,300 job cuts and a $2.8bn cut in capital spending.“We did an assessment of the business environment, opportunities, risk reward and value creation, but not as quickly as we could have,” he says. “We could and should have done it sooner. We were spending more capital than we had cash flow on opportunities that were not value creating.”Putting an end to that yielded such a positive response by investors that in March Conoco said it would shed an additional $5bn-$10bn in assets during the next two years on top of $7bn sold last year.However, Mr Kumar warns any strategy carries risks. By shrinking too much, companies lose the hedges provided by diversified portfolios.This is especially important for the exploration and production segment, which is exposed to multiple risks, such as high commodity price volatility, environmental accidents and expropriation of assets by foreign governments.For example, Seahawk Drilling filed for bankruptcy this year after the drilling moratorium following BP’s spill brought its Gulf of Mexico-focused business to a standstill.Devon is maintaining diversification, with its oil sands business in Canada and shale and conventional oil and gas exploration and production in the US. Conoco is holding on to refining with its exploration and production. In addition, Conoco says it may spend an additional $2.5bn this year on capital expenditures if the right opportunities arise in deepwater or shale.“You need to use a certain amount of money to invest for returns,” Mr Mulva says. “We have found the right balance.”"
281;COP;Conocophillips;2011-05-22T18:58:23Z;Kazakh PM says dispute risks oilfield delays;;Kazakhstan’s prime minister has given warning that a dispute with foreign oil groups at the giant Kashagan field risks delaying the central Asian country’s plan to double oil production and become a force on world energy markets.Kashagan is critical to Kazakhstan’s goal of doubling its 1.6m barrels of oil per day output and will play an important role in improving global energy security, providing a new source of non-Opec oil.The North Caspian Operating Company, a consortium of Royal Dutch Shell, Eni of Italy, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips of the US, Total of France and Inpex of Japan is developing Kashagan, one of only three fields in the world capable of producing more than 1m barrels of oil a day.However, the project, known in the oil industry as “cash all gone”, has been dogged by disputes and delays that have set back first production by more than seven years.Escalating costs and delays during phase one of Kashagan’s development sparked a row that ended when KazMunaigas, the Kazakh state oil company, doubled its stake in the project and became one of the operators in 2008. Phase one is due to come on stream next year, producing 370,000 b/d.Yet a fresh dispute has arisen over the budget and timetable for the second phase that threatens to delay plans to boost production to about 1m b/d by 2015.Karim Massimov, Kazakh prime minister, said the government would not give the green light for phase two until the cost of the project was agreed with NCOC. “This is an issue about the cost,” he told the Financial Times.NCOC said a “comprehensive review” of the design options for phase two, aimed at making the project “as economically robust as possible”, would be presented to the Kazakh government and shareholders by the end of the year.An executive close to the project said: “We are trying to reduce the cost and increase the production.”When Kashagan was discovered in 2000, the goal was to invest $10bn and produce first oil in 2005. However, NCOC underestimated the challenges of developing the field where oil lies in high pressure reservoirs in environmentally sensitive shallow waters.Under current plans, phase one will lead to Kashagan’s first barrels in 2012 at a cost of at least $30bn. Two further phases will bring the total cost of the development to $137bn, one of the most expensive industrial projects ever undertaken.“There is a certain amount of disappointment,” the executive said. “It still remains one of the best fields . . . it will be our grandchildren, not ourselves, who will enjoy it.”The executive added that he still expected phase two to proceed according to the original timetable, and begin producing in 2014 or 2015.Analysts said NCOC would oppose any further delays at Kashagan that would reduce the time the group had to produce profitable oil before their contract expired in 2037.Concern about KazMunaigas’ financial health is believed to be stoking tensions in NCOC, where foreign investors are reluctant to carry the state oil company’s costs.Mr Massimov said KazMunaigas might have difficulty fulfilling its overall capital expenditure programme if oil prices dropped but the government was ready to provide support to the company.Additional reporting by David Blair
282;COP;Conocophillips;2011-05-18T19:17:45Z;Alberta urges US to back oil pipeline;;The Canadian province of Alberta could be one of the seven largest oil producers in the world by the end of the decade, its energy minister has said, as he urged the US to back a pipeline project that is vital for the industry’s expansion plans.Ron Liepert, Alberta’s minister of energy, said that the US “has to make a decision” about whether it wanted the province’s oil, and that he was “proceeding all-out to find alternative markets for our product”, particularly in China.Environmental objections to new pipelines that are needed to export Alberta’s increased production are threatening to stifle the industry’s growth.Keystone XL, a proposed $7bn investment in a 1,661 mile pipeline system to take more oil from Alberta to the coast of Texas, is under review for a decision by the US state department, and is the subject of intense lobbying by the oil industry and environmentalists.Speaking on a visit to New York, Mr Liepert said: “We need the US to step up and start to show that they value our resources.”Canada is already the largest source of oil imports to the US, which produces only about half of the crude oil and petroleum products it consumes. Rising Canadian production offers the prospect of increased imports from a friendly neighbour, rather than from more distant and potentially unstable or hostile countries including Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria.However, many environmentalists oppose the plan to increase imports from Alberta, in part because most of the oil comes from the tar sands, also known as oil sands, which have significant impacts both in terms of local pollution and in carbon dioxide emissions, which are higher than for many other forms of oil production.Mr Liepert said that after a slowdown during the oil price slump, the oil sands industry was “going full speed ahead”, with production on course to rise from about 1.5m barrels per day to 3m b/d by the end of the decade.Hopes are also now rising that other sources of oil production, which have been in decline in Alberta, are picking up.Companies such as Calgary-based Laricina Energy are beginning to explore the potential of the Grosmont carbonate rock formation, which could hold as much oil as the tar sands. The success of these ventures is hard to predict, but Mr Liepert said the rate of technological progress in opening up previously uneconomic reserves meant that Alberta’s output could reach 4m b/d by 2020. This could be enough to make it one of the top producers, after Russia, Saudi Arabia, the US and possibly Iran, Iraq or Brazil.Only Brazil, with its large deepwater discoveries, and Iraq, are likely to come close to Canada in terms of production growth over the coming decade.Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil group by market capitalisation, recently described the Keystone XL project as “very important to energy security”.The US state department, which has to approve the project because it is a cross-border venture, has delayed its decision on the pipeline, but now says that it will make a ruling by the end of the year.Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said last year she was “inclined” to approve Keystone XL, but has been hit by a storm of protest from campaigners.Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, international programme director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the state department’s environmental impact statement had been inadequate: “They’re doing minimalistic work to get it through more quickly.”Mr Liepert said Chinese companies, which are already active in the oil sands, “will take every drop we are able to produce, in a heartbeat.”However, the Northern Gateway project to transport more oil to Canada’s west coast, in British Columbia, for export to China and other Asian markets has also encountered strong local objections.
283;COP;Conocophillips;2011-05-18T00:36:36Z;$35bn Alaska gas pipeline scrapped;;An ambitious $35bn plan by BP and ConocoPhillips to build a pipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska to the rest of the US has been cancelled after the boom in shale production and low prices led to insufficient demand from gas shippers.However, a rival project involving TransCanada, the Canadian pipeline company, and ExxonMobil of the US, is still moving ahead, its backers said.The Denali project, 50-50 owned by BP and Conoco, had been billed as the largest private sector construction project in North America. The groups, which formed a joint venture in 2008 to build the pipeline and a gas treatment plant in Alaska, said the rise of shale gas in the “lower 48” states had changed the market landscape.“This has created a very difficult environment in which to secure financial commitments from potential customers,” the groups said.BP and Conoco held an “open season” last year to collect commitments from gas shippers to use the pipeline, which would have had the capacity to move about 4bn cu ft of natural gas per day, but did not receive enough interest to continue the project.The two companies spent more than $165m and invested more than 760,000 man-hours in the project.The consortium is withdrawing its permit application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and, in the next few months, will close its operations.Technical breakthroughs have made it possible to exploit reserves of gas trapped in shale rocks that were previously uneconomic, opening up huge reserves in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Pennsylvania, making it unnecessary to import gas from Alaska.Analysts estimate that the US has 100 years of supply, at current usage rates. Indeed, the oversupply has led several companies to develop plans to export gas from the lower 48 states.“The explosion of shale gas reserves made this Alaska project a challenge,’’ said Bill Popp, chief executive of the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation. As for the competing Alaska Pipeline Project, led by TransCanada in partnership with the state of Alaska and with the support of Exxon, Mr Popp said: “The jury is still out as to how far they will continue to pursue this.’’Tony Palmer, vice-president of major projects and development for TransCanada, said that the project could break ground in 2016-17 and begin service in late 2020.“What really matters is what expectations are for gas prices from 2020-50, and beyond,” he said.
284;COP;Conocophillips;2011-05-12T22:39:16Z;Senators quiz US chiefs on $2bn tax deals;;"Democratic senators grilled the top five US oil executives at a congressional hearing, dubbing their defence of $2bn in annual tax breaks as out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people and with the need for fiscal restraint in Washington.Testifying before the Senate finance committee on Thursday, Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, said the elimination of his sector’s tax incentives would be “misinformed … discriminatory [and] counter-productive”.“By undermining US competitiveness, [the tax changes] would discourage future investments in energy projects here in the US and therefore undercut job creation and economic growth,” he said, adding it would “do nothing” to help reduce the $4 per gallon petrol prices experienced by many American consumers.But Senate Democrats relentlessly attacked the executives for several hours. “The five of you are like Saudi Arabia: you’re caught up in your profits, you’re highly defensive and you yield on nothing,” said Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia senator.Mr Tillerson responded: “I don’t think the American people want shared
sacrifice. I think they want shared prosperity.”Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, and Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, questioned James Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, on a press release this week that described cutting the tax breaks as “un-American”.“Do you make those accusations lightly? Or did you really mean to question
my patriotism? … Do you believe President Obama is un-American because
he has proposed cutting oil subsidies?” asked Mr Menendez.Mr Mulva responded that “there was nothing intended personally” but that cutting the tax breaks would have an “adverse impact” on US energy policy.Mr Schumer said Congress had to set priorities, asking whether Mr Mulva saw oil subsidies as more important than financial aid for college students.“That’s a very difficult question for me,” Mr Mulva replied. “That’s a choice that legislatively you’ll have to be making … For our company, what we are tasked with is to provide energy in an affordable way to the American public.”“It will also mean fewer dollars to state and federal treasuries, and fewer jobs – all while our economic recovery remains fragile and America needs all three,” said John Watson, Chevron chief executive.Lamar McKay, chairman of BP America, added that the proposed tax changes would also curb the company’s ability to invest in “new and emerging technologies like wind, biofuels and solar.”Some Republicans were sympathetic. Orrin Hatch, the panel’s top Republican, said the hearing amounted to a dog-and-pony show designed to “score cheap political points against politically unpopular oil companies” and provide a “justification for tax increases”. Mr Hatch said: “I do not believe we should go down the dangerous road of deterring American businesses from becoming too profitable.”But while the oil and gas executives defended their tax incentives, they said they would be open to accepting their elimination in the context of broad reform that would lower the tax rate on corporate profits.”All of these things we’re talking about today should be on the table in comprehensive tax reform,” said Lamar McKay, chairman of BP America.Republicans have also said oil and gas tax deductions should be considered in an overhaul, but they oppose the Democratic efforts to curb the incentives before then."
285;COP;Conocophillips;2011-05-11T21:13:08Z;Oil industry brands US tax proposals as political ploy;;ExxonMobil, the biggest international oil company, accused the US administration and Congress of “political theatre” in targeting the industry with discriminatory tax proposals that are due to be promoted at a Senate panel on Thursday.Ken Cohen, Exxon’s vice-president of public and government affairs, told the Financial Times the theatrics were merely “the kickoff for the 2012 presidential campaign and congressional elections”.The Senate finance committee has called on oil and gas executives to testify at the hearing as to why they need tax breaks, given strong profits amid high – and rising – petrol prices.A proposal by Senate Democrats unveiled this week would cut $2bn in annual tax breaks benefiting oil and gas groups as rising petrol prices hit consumers already struggling with the weak economy.The bill excludes smaller producers, but the biggest ones plan an aggressive defence of what they insist are already weaker tax breaks than those extended to other manufacturers. A company making refrigerators can deduct 9 per cent of earnings from its tax bill, said Mr Cohen, while a producer of petrol or natural gas is eligible to deduct only 6 per cent.While the issue of eliminating tax breaks arises whenever oil prices climb, the industry fears this time real changes might be pushed through given concerns about the US fiscal position. Instead of directing the funds to renewable energy investments, as had been the case in previous energy tax subsidy bills, the latest one would move the money straight to deficit reduction, achieving $21bn in savings over 10 years.The predictable fightback from the oil industry comes amid low expectations that a law will ultimately be enacted. While Republicans – who have traditionally protected the sector and now hold a majority in the House of Representatives – have indicated a willingness to consider curbing such tax breaks, they are unlikely to move forwards without comprehensive tax reform. This is not likely before the 2012 elections.Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said the tax proposals were “political decoys”. Reducing $4bn in tax breaks for the oil industry would not lower petrol prices, which must be addressed by forcing the industry to hold substantial petrol stocks or releasing fuel from the strategic petroleum reserve, she said. It would not have a significant impact on the deficit.Mr Cohen says the oil industry adds $1,000bn a year in value to the US economy, including $558bn of labour income. It also supports 9.2m jobs, and the tax breaks support these investments, he adds.Jim Mulva, ConocoPhillips’ chief executive, said: “Increasing these taxes would cost jobs and raise gasoline and other consumer prices, while actually unintentionally reducing the government’s tax revenues by discouraging investment.”Jeff Sheets, Conoco’s chief financial officer, called some proposals “un-American’’ in forcing US oil companies that have paid taxes on earnings in a foreign country to pay taxes again in the US. Foreign competitors would not be forced to pay taxes twice. “The US companies could become non-competitive,” said Mr Sheets.
286;COP;Conocophillips;2011-05-06T21:47:28Z;Wall Street rallies on US jobs;;A volatile week on Wall Street ended on a high note after better than expected employment data pulled investor sentiment from the doldrums and helped energy and materials stocks rebound.Materials stocks saw some of the strongest gains of the session with the S&P materials index up 0.7 per cent, helping to pare some of the 4.5 per cent losses seen earlier in the week due to falling commodity prices.Material stocks had taken a particular battering on Thursday as commodity prices suffered their sharpest one-day fall since the financial crisis.But on Friday, investors speculated that the losses may have been overdone, and the sector rebounded. Cliff Natural Resources was up 1 per cent to $88.93 while Alcoa, the aluminium producer, added 0.8 per cent to $17.15.These gains helped the wider markets snap a four-day losing streak. The S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent to 1,340.20, still leaving the benchmark index 1.7 per cent lower over the week, however.Sentiment was lifted in the session by strong employment data. The crucial non-farm payroll figures from the labour department showed that 244,000 jobs had been added last month in the US, ahead of the 185,000 that had been expected by economists.The data showed that the government’s work force had fallen in April but that the private sector had more than taken up the slack, adding 268,000 jobs. The unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points to 9 per cent.These data were particularly market moving because a key reason for the losses on Wall Street earlier in the week had been worries that the non-farm payroll numbers would be sluggish.Because of this, the S&P 500 index jumped 1.2 per cent following the figures.But the markets then pared some of these gains after a report in a German newspaper that Greece was considering leaving the eurozone and abandoning the single currency.The S&P energy index was 2.3 per cent higher following the jobs report, paring some of the 7.3 per cent in losses seen earlier in the week, but the index was only 0.4 per cent higher at the close because of the speculation over Greece.In the energy sector, EOG Resources was up 2.3 per cent to $117.44, helped by healthy earnings numbers. Elsewhere in the sector, ConocoPhillips rose 1.4 per cent to $72.94 while Tesoro added 2.6 per cent to $24.91.A number of positive earnings reports also helped to lift sentiment. Shares in Kraft Foods were up 2.1 per cent to $34.08 as the food group reported a rise in revenue and margins.Elsewhere, Visa reported a 24 per cent increase in profits as a result of higher consumer spending and the stock was up 0.9 per cent to $79.41.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 per cent to 12,638.81 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,827.56. The indices were down 1.3 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively over the five days.The markets had opened on Monday in positive territory as the news on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed prompted a “risk on” trade across the world. But this quickly fizzled out as investors turned their attention to more prosaic matters and began to worry that the market was overbought following the technical highs reached in previous sessions.Late in April, the S&P index achieved a 35-month high, the Nasdaq rose to a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.The sense that the market was overheating was also compounded by weak economic data throughout much of the week. As well as lacklustre employment data on Wednesday and Thursday, the ISM non-manufacturing index showed a sharp decrease in the rate of growth in the US service sector in April.Earnings also failed to give the same lift to the markets as the number of companies beating expectations fell back.Two weeks after the start of the earnings season in early April, 80 per cent of companies had beaten analysts’ expectations with their quarterly earnings results. At the end of April, the positive surprise rate was 76 per cent, but now the rate stands at 73 per cent, with slightly less than 100 companies left to report.But the biggest drags on the S&P index over the week were energy and materials stocks as the correction in commodity prices gathered steam. The S&P energy index was down 7 per cent over the week while the S&P material index lost 3.8 per cent.
287;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Warning over energy sector tax increase;;Some of the UK’s biggest gas producers have warned the government that a recent tax increase on the energy industry will accelerate the country’s reliance on gas imports and lead to higher bills for households.In an open letter published on Friday addressed to the prime minister and the chancellor, as well as the energy, business and Scottish secretaries, chief executives from companies representing about 60 per cent of UK gas production including BG Group, BHP Billiton and Centrica urged the government to rethink March’s tax increase as it applies to gas production.They warn that the rise will “damage the UK economy by reducing the attractiveness of investing in the UK Continental Shelf, particularly in gas development and production”.“This, in turn, will accelerate the UK’s reliance on imported gas and lead to increased costs for domestic customers,” adds the letter. The signatories include Frank Chapman of BG Group, Marius Kloppers of BHP Billiton, Sam Laidlaw of Centrica and Jim Mulva, chairman and chief executive of ConocoPhillips.The chancellor in March increased the supplementary charge on oil and gas producers’ profits from 20 per cent to 32 per cent to help pay for a 1p-a-litre cut in the fuel duty, prompting an industry outcry.Executives are particularly concerned that the tax increase does not take into account that gas prices have not risen in line with oil prices. When the price of a barrel of Brent crude rises above $75, the Treasury imposes the same “supplementary tax” on the profits made by every “barrel of oil equivalent”, regardless of whether it is oil or gas.In the letter, the chief executives claim “the economics of new gas projects are already marginal and are significantly less robust than those for oil”.Brent crude is trading at about $105 per barrel, while UK wholesale gas is trading at only about $49 per barrel of oil equivalent – less than half the price of oil.The letter says: “Investor confidence has been severely damaged by this policy. The increased level of risk now associated with investing in the UK Continental Shelf will inevitably hold back production projects in the area. This will compound the tax impact, accelerating the decline of the North Sea at exactly the time when we should be seeking to maximise our indigenous gas and oil supplies.”The letter marks a stepping up of efforts by the energy industry to persuade the government to rethink its proposals. In spite of companies’ efforts, the Treasury has so far refused to budge.Justine Greening, economic secretary to the Treasury, on Wednesday told the Commons energy select committee that the cost of extraction for gas was cheaper than for oil. She said that as a result, the two commodities had a comparable profit margin.
288;COP;Conocophillips;2011-04-28T18:02:09Z;Higher oil prices and margins lift majors;;Profits at two of the world’s biggest oil companies have soared on the back of a rise in crude prices of more than $100 a barrel and higher refining margins, underlining the sector’s broader recovery.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest company by market capitalisation, on Thursday reported a 69 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings to $10.7bn, its best quarterly performance since 2008 when oil prices were last above $100 a barrel. Rival Royal Dutch Shell announced a 30 per cent rise in underlying first-quarter profit on a current cost of supplies basis, which removes the effect of price changes on inventories and strips out one-off items, to $6.3bn.Along with BP and Conoco-Phillips, which reported on Wednesday, four of the world’s supermajors have now reported about $25.5bn in profits in the first quarter compared with $18.8bn in the same period last year. Chevron and Total of France report quarterly results on Friday.Among its peers Exxon is so far the only company to record an increase in production in the quarter, reporting a 10 per cent increase driven mainly by its Qatar natural gas business and global unconventional gas production.Exxon credited the performance to not only a rise in crude oil and natural gas production but also increased refining margins and a record performance in its chemicals division.The results prompted a political backlash in the US where Rep. Edward Markey, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, said “there is absolutely no reason to continue to subsidise the most profitable companies in the history of the world”. He added: “What is good for the biggest oil companies isn’t always what’s good for American taxpayers. The American people are getting tipped upside down at the pump, then asked to fork over whatever change they have left to subsidise these oil behemoths.” However, Ken Cohen, vice-president for public and government affairs at Exxon, stressed that the pain US motorists are feeling was not down to the company profiteering.The government, he added, was unfortunately “reaching for the political playbook rather than seeking real solutions”.In the UK, where the high crude prices recently prompted the government to announce a hike in North Sea oil and gas tax, the increase could cost Shell close to $1bn in additional charges next year, the Anglo-Dutch oil group warned.Simon Henry, chief financial officer, said the company expected to book a charge of $400m in 2012 if oil prices remained at current levels after the Treasury increased the supplementary charge on oil and gas production from 50 per cent to at least 62 per cent.
289;COP;Conocophillips;2011-04-28T17:27:05Z;ExxonMobil profit jumps on high oil prices;;ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company by market capitalisation, reported a 69 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings to $10.7bn on high oil prices combined with rising production.Oil-equivalent production rose more than 10 per cent from the first quarter last year, driven mainly by Exxon’s Qatar natural gas business and global unconventional gas production.That stood in stark contrast to the production of Exxon’s peers: BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips all reported falls in output for the quarter. Chevron reports Friday.Exxon credited the stellar performance not only to a rise in crude oil and natural gas production but also increased refining margins and a record performance in its chemicals division.All contributed to the better-than-expected $2.14 earnings per share that was up 61 per cent from the same period a year earlier and the company’s best quarterly performance since 2008 – when profits also were lifted by rising commodity prices.Analysts had forecast Exxon would report a first-quarter profit of $2.07 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.“The beat is mainly in chemicals,” said Edward Westlake, oil analyst at Credit Suisse Global Energy. “ExxonMobil’s chemical business is doing very well due to cheap US natural gas prices and strong Asia demand. Chemical results will cause an upward appraisal of chemical earnings power. However, investors like exploration and production beats better.”Exxon’s share price was up marginally to $87.20 by lunchtime in New York.The company’s chemical division reported earnings of $1.5bn, $267m higher than the first quarter of 2010.Mr Westlake said the company’s Upstream, or exploration and production, segment was “five per cent light of our expectations”.Exxon’s exploration and production earnings were $8.7bn, up $2.9bn from the first quarter of 2010.Its liquids production, including crude oil and natural gas liquids, was 2,399 thousands of barrels per day, down substantially from the first quarter of 2010.But natural gas production was 14,525 millions of cubic feet per day, up 2,836 millions of cubic feet per day from 2010, underlining the increasing shift of the world’s biggest oil companies into gas.Total revenue and other income was $114bn, up from $90.3bn in the first quarter of 2010.Production from the redevelopment of Iraq’s West Qurna 1 field contributed, exceeding the 10 per cent improvement target, with current production now about 320,000 barrels per day.Exxon put $7.8bn towards capital and exploration expenditures in the quarter – up 14 per cent from the first quarter of 2010.The company returned more than $7bn to shareholders through dividends and share purchases of $5bn. Exxon said it expected to spend the same amount on share purchases in the second quarter of 2011.It raised the dividend by 5 per cent over the first quarter of 2010 to 44 cents.
290;COP;Conocophillips;2011-04-27T20:56:04Z;US markets cheer Fed decision;;Amazon led the gains on Wall Street after investors responded positively to its first-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets the Nasdaq Composite index hit a 10-year high after the Federal Reserve’s latest statement on monetary policy and the subsequent press briefing by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed.Shares in the world’s largest online retailer jumped 7.9 per cent to $169.63, an all-time high, after the company reported a 38 per cent jump in sales.This increase in revenues, however, was accompanies by a 33 per cent fall in net income for the quarter as new investments in data storage and distribution eclipsed the rise in sales.But investors had already braced themselves for a drop in earnings and some analysts appeared to be convinced by a letter from Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer, justifying the revenue focused strategy.This helped the S&P retail sector add 1.6 per cent and helped boost the Nasdaq Composite up 0.8 per cent to 2,869.88, a 10-year high.The S&P 500 was flat for much of the day, but jumped higher after the statements by Mr Bernanke and the Fed. The benchmark index closed up 0.6 at 1,355.66, a multi-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8 per cent at 12,690.96.The Fed held rates steady at 0 to 0.25 per cent but tweaked its statement on growth, reducing its outlook from a “firmer footing” for the recovery to a “moderate” pace of growth. The central bank also said that it would end its $600bn “QE2” quantitative easing programme and Mr Bernanke suggested that the pace of stimulus might slow.Sentiment in the wider markets was also helped by data showing that US durable goods orders had jumped last month, with orders rising 2.5 per cent in March after a revised 0.7 per cent rise in February.In the previous session, the S&P 500 reached its highest level since June 2008, indicating that the markets have now recovered from sharp losses following the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa and the natural disaster in Japan.Much of the recent gains in the S&P have been driven by a strong start to the earnings season. Of the 197 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 77 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, said that momentum in the markets would continue to tick higher from here over the year, but there was likely to be more volatility.Boeing’s profits in the first quarter exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock advanced 0.8 per cent to $76.12. The world’s second-biggest aircraft maker by revenue made a net profit of $586m, or 78 cents per share, up from $519m, or 70 cents per share, in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about 72 cents per share.Northrop Grummanreported a 21 per cent rise in earnings, beating estimates, while also raising its full-year guidance. Stock in the defence and aerospace group put on 0.7 per cent to $62.90.Rockwell Automation, the maker of factory automation equipment and software, saw one of the sharpest losses of the session, falling 8.7 per cent to $89.33 after reporting only a modest profit and a small increase to its 2011 earnings forecast.Elsewhere in the sector Parker Hannifin, another industrial supplier, also disappointed with its earnings and the stock declined 5.1 per cent to $93.48.Disappointing earnings reports from ConocoPhillips and National Oilwell Varco weighed on the energy sector.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, reported a 43 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings, but missed its production and refining targets, leaving the stock down 1.7 per cent at $79.83.The decline in production was due to civil unrest in Libya, a supply vessel collision with a company platform, natural field decline and the temporary shutdown of the trans-Alaska pipeline system.Elsewhere in the sector, National Oilwell fell 4.6 per cent to $76.88 after the US oilfield equipment maker reported a 4 per cent drop in quarterly profit amid restructuring charges and Libya-related writedowns.
291;COP;Conocophillips;2011-04-27T16:08:26Z;ConocoPhillips profit jumps 43%;;"ConocoPhillips, the third-biggest US oil company, expressed disappointment at missing production and refining targets even as it reported a 43 per cent year-on-year rise in earnings to $3bn in the first quarter.Excluding gains from asset sales, first-quarter adjusted earnings were $2.6bn, or $1.82 per share. Conoco has embarked on a shrink-to-grow restructuring that includes selling up to $17bn in assets through 2012.It is the first of the big US oil companies to report first-quarter results. ExxonMobil is to report Thursday and Chevron on Friday, with rising commodity prices expected to support strong earnings throughout the sector. In the UK, BP announced results on Wednesday and Shell is to report on Thursday.Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chairman and chief executive, said that while the company’s financial results were “much improved from a year ago,” both production and capacity utilization in its refining segment missed internal targets.The company was also hit in the quarter by $200m of unplanned downtime and compensation expenses.Production for the first quarter was 1.7m barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day, a decrease of about 125,000 BOE per day versus the same period in 2010.The decrease was due to natural field decline and several unplanned events: the temporary shutdown of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System; a supply vessel collision with a company platform; and civil unrest in Libya.Field decline, from maturing assets, decreased production by about 190,000 BOE per day. But that was largely offset by about 180,000 BOE per day of new production and improved well performance, largely from its Qatar gas project and the liquids-rich shale assets in the US.The unplanned downtime in Conoco’s exploration and production division of about 65,000 BOE per day reduced earnings for the quarter by about $100m.Asset sales in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 also negatively impacted year-over-year production by about 50,000 BOE per day.Refining was also hit. “While we had significant improvement in earnings from our downstream business, we did not capture all the market opportunities available to us due to downtime at several refineries,” Mr Mulva said.The refining business’s first-quarter earnings were higher than the corresponding period of 2010, mostly due to improved global refining margins. But the US refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 87 per cent, and the international rate was 96 per cent.``For the quarter, earnings would have been about $50m higher if we had operated our US downstream at planned levels,’’ Mr Mulva said.Nonetheless, Conoco remains an investor favorite, given a shrink-to-grow strategy that included repurchasing 21m of its shares for $1.6bn and increasing the quarterly dividend rate by 20 per cent to 66 cents per share.Conoco’s share price was down 3 per cent at $78.76 at midday."
292;COP;Conocophillips;2011-04-17T20:44:08Z;Testing times await disaster response units;;Standing on a steel pad surrounded by gravel on the outskirts of Houston is the piece of the puzzle that eluded BP last year as its Macondo disaster unfolded.The Containment Response System, a piece of equipment 31ft tall, 14.5ft wide and weighing more than 100 tonnes, is designed to be trucked to anywhere along the US coast of the Gulf of Mexico, loaded on to a vessel, shipped to a drill site and dispatched under water to contain oil coming out of a leaking well.The system, complete with capture vessels, cost $1bn (£600m) and was created by ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. It took several months to build, and testing has shown it can operate in 8,000ft of water, capturing 60,000 barrels of fluid a day at pressures of 15,000 pounds per square inch.A more comprehensive system, which can operate in 10,000ft of water and capture 100,000 barrels of fluid a day, will be available by the middle of next year.“Everything you see here has a proven track record in the oil and gas industry,” said Marty Massey, chief executive of the Marine Well Containment Company, the joint venture that built and is maintaining the equipment. He is dwarfed by the huge chunk of steel that the industry is counting on to restore its reputation should another spill occur. “I am confident we can provide the response required.”Six other companies – including BP – have now joined the four founders, and the 10 companies are equal partners in the venture, sharing all costs and votes on future developments. But anyone operating deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico can contract the system on a per well basis for an undisclosed sum.“The industry has never really come together before like this,” Mr Massey said.It did not have a choice. Matthew Snyder, manager of Gulf of Mexico Upstream Research for Wood Mackenzie, the energy research firm, said: “The oil spill response plan for the industry needed to be updated. Both the industry and the government were not prepared for a spill of that magnitude.”Gary Adams, US oil and gas leader at Deloitte, the consultancy, said: “The industry had to better think through what happens in the event of a deepwater spill.”The Marine Well Containment Company is not the only organisation creating a spill response system.Equipment designed by the Helix Well Containment Group, a consortium of 24 deepwater operators in the Gulf of Mexico, can contain spills in 8,000ft of water and capture and process 55,000 barrels of oil a day at pressure of 15,000 psi. The system will be able to handle spills at depths of 10,000 feet by this summer.“Industry learnt from the Macondo incident and has put those learnings to use,” said Gary Luquette, president of Chevron’s North America Exploration and Production division. “With unprecedented prevention, intervention and response measures now in place, the industry is safer and more prepared than ever.”That confidence has been enough to lead regulators to authorise drilling in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, but it is still not good enough for some environmentalists.“A recently approved Shell Offshore deepwater exploration plan has a worst-case blow-out discharge of 184,000 barrels per day – around three times the amount of oil that the government estimates spilled per day during the BP oil spill,” said Derb Carter, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, an advocacy group comprised of lawyers. “Yet, two untested systems relied on by oil companies may currently contain 55,000 to 60,000 barrels per day – only a fraction of a potential deepwater spill from Shell’s own estimate, and only after one to three weeks of uncontrolled spill from a blow-out,” he said.The industry’s response? Bill Tanner, Shell spokesman, called this a worst-case scenario that assumed there was no wellhead or blow-out preventer to block the flow.That is what BP encountered. While the industry insists Macondo was a one-off, the reality is that disagreements over the new system’s adequacy will only end when another accident puts it to the test.
293;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;The oil spill that changed the industry;;“In the business of hydrocarbons there will always be risk,” Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP’s chairman, told investors at the UK oil group’s first annual meeting since the Gulf of Mexico accident last week. Shareholders, he went on, must be comfortable “that we are taking the right risks on your behalf to safeguard your investment”.How best to manage the risk that is an integral part of the business of oil and gas exploration, and what lessons the industry should draw from the BP spill, has become a focus for the industry.Bob Dudley, BP’s new chief executive, has completely revamped the company’s approach to safety, setting up a new safety and risk division with sweeping powers to oversee and audit its operations. But a year on from the spill many of the more visible industry-wide changes have focused on how to deal with an emergency.Even before the Macondo well was finally sealed in September, four of the world’s biggest oil companies, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips agreed to pool $1bn (£600m) to form a joint venture to develop a Gulf of Mexico oil spill response and containment system. Under the plans, the venture will develop equipment to prevent another spill on the scale suffered by BP’s Macondo well.“There was a lot learnt the hard way dealing with Macondo,” said Charles Swanson, Houston managing partner at Ernst & Young. For example, he said, the industry learnt more about what does and does not work when trying to capture runaway production under 5,000ft of water.“There is now more communication and co-ordination between the operators and service providers involved in a drilling project.”Companies have also been hiring employees to serve in very specific crisis and incident management roles.According to Kenny Davis, regional director for Europe and North America for NES Global Talent, specialists are now being hired to fine-tune and constantly monitor emergency response planning and how companies would react to a crisis.In the past five years, he said, he could count on one hand the number of times someone had requested such a specialist. But in the past 12 months almost every client had expressed interest in this skill set.Companies have also increased the frequency with which they test vital equipment on rigs, including the blow-out preventer (BOP), the stack of valves on the seabed intended to prevent the escape of oil and gas, which failed during the BP accident.Marvin Odum, head of Shell’s US operations, said the BOP was an area that needed additional research and development to improve its function.Companies are also changing the way they operate, with perhaps the biggest scrutiny on partnering.BP’s junior partners on the Macondo well, Anadarko Petroleum and Mitsui of Japan, have so far disputed whether they should pay a portion of the clean-up costs, saying they had left the running of the operation to BP. The UK oil group believes they should contribute.Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, a consultancy, said: “In the old days, the operator called the shots, and the others went along for the ride. The role of the partner has changed. They want technologically and financially capable partners, they expect higher standards from the service companies.”Mr Odum said: “The changes in the amount of scrutiny to anyone operating on our behalf has changed in a notable way.”Outsourcing to third-party service companies such as Transocean, the owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP, is another area that could see changes. Big oil companies have progressively outsourced more work over the years as a way of reducing costs. But following the spill, some long-term industry advisers argue it makes sense to bring some skills back in-house.Others say that the relationship between operators and service companies will remain strong as the oil companies do much to stimulate research at their preferred service providers.Industry regulation is also changing in the US. In its report on the spill, one of the conclusions of the US National Commission was that other countries with strong offshore oil industries, including Britain and Norway, had better regulatory systems than the US.Many of the changes recommended in the report would align the US regime more closely with that in the UK, where the current regulatory framework was introduced in 1990 after the Piper Alpha disaster.The onus on proving there were adequate safety measures on offshore installations shifted away from the regulator and on to the oil companies. Another change in Britain after the Piper Alpha disaster was that the responsibilities for handing out drilling permits and overseeing safety were split, and are now controlled by the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Health and Safety Executive respectively. The US has already followed this model since the BP spill, with the disbanding of the Minerals Management Service.Nevertheless, further change was necessary, the report said, recommending an approach similar to Britain’s “safety-case” system, which forces companies to persuade the regulator that they have identified and dealt with all potential hazards.While the industry is undoubtedly learning from the spill, there remains a range of views over just how radical the changes to industry and regulation should be.Many executives are concerned that their companies’ reputations are in danger of being undermined if people are left with the impression that there is a systemic problem in the industry.Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon, told analysts last month that more than 14,000 wells had been drilled safely around the world. The cause of the accident was “a breakdown of management oversight of that well”, Mr Tillerson said, “and that breakdown of management oversight rests in the lap of one company, principally”.

Shares in the biofuels group jumped 46 per cent to 3.13p on news that Siemens was conducting a trial to see how a high-speed ferry would run on turbines fuelled by a vegetable oil made from the seeds of the jatropha plant.Traders noted that this was one of three trials for which D1 is supplying 70 tonnes of jatropha oil. Good results could lead to large offtake agreements for D1, once a darling of the internet bulletin boards.Bellzone Mining eased 0.7 per cent to 71½p, even though worries that a large block of stock was about to hit the market faded. For the past week rumours have swirled the City that 20m shares - about 3.2 per cent of the company - owned by the estate of Australian businessman Ken Talbot were set to be placed at about 70p.However, Renaissance Capital said that the Talbot Estate had no intention of the selling at the moment because it saw significant upside, something echoed by Canaccord Genuity. “We now understand from the management of Bellzone that they have met with the executors of Ken Talbot’s estate and that the executors have stated that they are no longer looking to sell the stake in Bellzone due to their positive view on the company and see significant upside,” it said.Gulf Keystone Petroleum advanced 15.5 per cent to 164p on rumours of another update from the current drilling campaign, specifically the Shaikan-2 appraisal well.Beacon Hill Resources, the Aim-listed mining group with assets in Mozambique, was in focus. This week the company announced plans to acquire a substantial new coal asset in the east African country. The licence is located close to its existing Minas Moatize mine and will cost $42m. Traders reckon the company might need a cash call to fund the acquisition.“Early stages – but this looks like a very interesting deal. The [decision] has the potential to increase Beacon’s coal resource five-fold and [to] move the company from a small niche operation with fast-track production to a significant regional operator,” said Northland Capital Partners in a recent note.HMV was marked 4.1 per cent lower at 11½p after another couple of profits warnings in the retail sector - this time by Halfords, down 5 per cent at 350p, and by Carpetright, off 5.9 per cent at 632p.Armour Group, the home and in-car audio group, fell 20 per cent to 4½p as it too warned about profits, blaming a sharp slowdown in sales in its retail business over the last six weeks.“We believe that this year should see the nadir in the group’s fortunes. This view is based on the impact of government cuts and increased taxation having its worst impact in the current year, with a slow restoration in consumer confidence thereafter,” said house broker FinnCap, which nonetheless cut its target price from 10p to 5p.Redhall the specialist engineering group, picked up 4.4 per cent to 70½p after announcing a series of contract wins and announcing it was on track to meet forecasts.“The group have announced further contract wins totalling £10m from AWE, British Energy, Chevron and Conoco Phillips,” noted Altium Securities. “We see these wins together as a vote of confidence in the group from a blue chip customer base after recent events.” Redhall parted company with its chief executive this year and more recently ran into problems with a contract for Vivergo Fuels.
295;COP;Conocophillips;2011-04-04T01:34:00Z;Conoco eyes deepwater even as it streamlines;;"After winning over investors with its shrink-to-grow strategy, ConocoPhillips is shifting its sights back to acquisitions, targeting the deepwater and shale patch.Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, told the Financial Times he would expand planned capital spending of $13.5bn this year by $2.5bn for the right opportunities, even as he continues selling assets in a streamlining that has pushed the group’s share price up by more than 40 per cent in the past year. “We would like to be more in the Gulf of Mexico; we have been late to this opportunity,” he said. “We feel we have the capital, technology, people and the good safety record.”That was one of the reasons why Conoco was a founding partner with ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron in the Marine Well Containment Company, which was formed after BP’s Macondo disaster to provide spill response services in the gulf.Conoco is considering a variety of options – whether to partner with larger or smaller companies on exploration or discovered prospects – and is patient about getting a deal done.Outside the gulf, it is looking at deepwater prospects in west Africa and is in talks about potentially picking up exploration blocks offshore Angola.Conoco already has a strong position in both shale gas and oil, with a more than $1bn investment in the sought-after Eagle Ford Shale, where its holdings are in the “sweet spot” with 70 per cent liquids, including oil and natural gas condensate.Mr Mulva is looking to expand his shale position by looking beyond the established plays of the Eagle Ford of Texas and the Marcellus of the north-east.“We’re trying to find the new Marcellus and the new Eagle Ford,” he said. “We are putting quite a bit of effort in this in the US, Canada, eastern Europe and China.”This does not mean the US’s third biggest oil company is abandoning its shrink-to-grow strategy. Mr Mulva plans to shed an additional $5bn-$10bn in assets during the next two years on top of $7bn sold last year. The company began restructuring after it disclosed a 2008 fourth-quarter net loss of $31.8bn, a $34bn writedown, 1,300 job losses and a $2.8bn cut in capital spending. And it is not done. “It’s a journey,” he said. “It’s not accomplished quickly.”He said the company had some very mature properties in North America and the North Sea that could bring more value to someone else. In addition, he is looking to sell out of places where Conoco only holds a small position, particularly if it is in a country in which it is difficult to operate or, again, if the prospect would bring more value to someone else.But he is giving himself two years to finalise the sales: “I don’t want to be pressured by the marketplace. We don’t want to just give assets away.”"
296;COP;Conocophillips;2011-03-23T17:33:18Z;ConocoPhillips to sell up to $10bn in assets;;"ConocoPhillips, the third-biggest oil and gas company in the US, said it would shed an additional $5bn-$10bn in assets during the next two years on top of $7bn sold last year.The company’s shrink-to-grow strategy has been welcomed by investors, who pushed the company’s share price up by more than 40 per cent during the past year.On Wednesday, when the additional sales were announced, Conoco’s shares rose 65 cents to $77.87 on the NYSE in late morning trading. The sale of non-core assets is part of Conoco’s overall strategy to improve capital efficiency, reduce debt and increase shareholder distributions.Paul Sankey, analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said: “The major disposal-to-share-buy-back programme is unique among major oils in exploiting the arbitrage between equity market valuations for majors, and asset market values for individual assets when sold. We believe all the majors, apart from Conoco, are failing to act sufficiently aggressively on this.”The company began restructuring after it disclosed a 2008 fourth-quarter net loss of $31.8bn; a $34bn writedown; 1,300 in job losses; and a $2.8bn cut in capital spending.The financial crisis had exposed weaknesses in what had been until then a growth through acquisition strategy, which resulted in it spending the least of any of the big oil companies on exploration or development as a percentage of total capital expenditure. However, almost 90 per cent of its $13.5bn 2011 capital programme has now been allocated to exploration and production, while it has set a “greater than 100 per cent reserve replacement target’’.It is increasingly focused on onshore US shale gas and oil, Canadian oil sands, and other unconventional plays.The company plans to use proceeds from the increased asset sales to primarily fund a $10bn share buy-back programme, as well as other capital investment. That share buy-back is on top of the existing $5bn repurchase programme announced last year, under which the company has repurchased about $4bn of its common stock.“We think our focus on capital discipline and increasing shareholder distributions is the most appropriate approach for our company,” said Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chairman and chief executive.In 2010, Conoco generated $15.4bn, with $8.3bn of that from its sale of Lukoil shares and the rest from asset sales."
297;COP;Conocophillips;2011-03-20T22:22:53Z;Oil companies fear nationalisation in Libya;;Western oil companies operating in Libya have privately warned that their operations in the country may be nationalised if Colonel Muammer Gaddafi’s regime prevails.Executives, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the rapidly moving situation, believe their companies could be targeted, especially if their home countries are taking part in air strikes against Mr Gaddafi. Allied forces from France, the UK and the US on Saturday unleashed a series of strikes against military targets in Libya.“It is certainly a concern. There are good reserves there,” said one executive at a western oil company with operations in Libya. “We have lost some of our production [because all operations have stopped] but our bigger concern is what will happen to the exploratory work as that gives you a future rather than the immediate impact,” he added.Most of the world’s large international oil companies have producing assets in Libya, including Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, and Italy’s Eni, which is the largest single investor there. Germany’s Winstershall – a unit of BASF – and OMV of Austria are also present.The country is the world’s 12th largest oil exporter, and the escalating violence there has triggered a jump in prices to nearly $120 a barrel. More than half of Libya’s oil was exported to Italy, Germany and France last year.“International oil companies will find themselves in a precarious position in Libya going forwards, with both the government side and the opposition now pressuring IOCs [international oil companies],” Samuel Ciszuk, senior Middle East energy analyst at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note. “Libya’s regime has a history of treating IOCs as extensions of their home governments, which ultimately risks damaging European and US-based companies”.Shokri Ghanem, the chairman of the Libya’s state-run National Oil Corporation, warned on Saturday that western companies, which have repatriated their staff due to the crisis, should send their employees back to work or risk seeing new oil and gas concessions awarded directly to rivals from China, India and Brazil. The three countries have all stayed neutral throughout the conflict and abstained from Thursday’s United Nations Security Council resolution 1973.Mr Ghanem said Libya had no intention of breaking its existing commitments with foreign oil companies already operating in the country but warned that “we do hope they in turn will honour their agreements with us”.“If they do not then we are forced to talk to others,” he added. Libyan production has fallen 75 per cent to 400,000 barrels a day since the withdrawal of employees by western companies and “could reach a halt”, he warned.The UN has widened its economic sanctions against the regime of Mr Gaddafi, including for the first time the oil sector. In addition to the no-fly zone and threat of air strikes, UN resolution 1973 also stipulates freezing the assets of the National Oil Corporation.While Libya’s state-owned National Oil Company controls the majority of the country’s oil production, international oil companies are key for sustaining output through joint ventures. The National Oil Company is also in full control of at least two of its subsidiaries, its wholly owned Sirte Oil, a joint venture with US-based Occidental Petroleum, and Waha Oil, a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Hess.
298;COP;Conocophillips;2011-03-17T21:50:47Z;Wall Street led by industrial gains;;Industrial and commodity stocks led a rebound on Wall Street following strong manufacturing data and a sense that the sharp sell-off in the previous session had been overdone.The S&P 500 bounced back 1.3 per cent to 1,273.72, paring some of the 2 per cent losses in the previous session, boosted by news that the Philadelphia Fed business activity index had showed its best monthly reading since January 1984.The index climbed 7.3 points in March to 43.4, far surpassing the 28.8 reading expected by economists.Also lifting sentiment was separate figures showing that weekly unemployment claims had declined by 16,000 to 385,000. “The downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data helped industrial stocks post some of the strongest gains in the session, recovering from some of the sharp losses earlier in the week. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, added 1.4 per cent to $19.22, paring back the 3.4 per cent losses seen in the previous session. The stock is down 5.6 per cent over the week, however.The S&P industrial index was up 1.6 per cent, reducing some of the 3.9 per cent losses suffered in the past five days. 3M was up 1.3 per cent to $88.69 while Honeywell was 1.6 per cent higher to $55.21 in the session.Elsewhere in the sector, FedEx saw gains after giving a strong fourth-quarter profit forecast. The package delivery company predicted a profit of $1.66 to $1.83 a share, topping the $1.66 estimated by analysts.This bright outlook overshadowed a reported 3.3 per cent fall in third-quarter profits and the shares were up 3.1 per cent to $87.89.Shares in rival UPS were up 1.8 per cent to $71.61 while Expeditors added 1.2 per cent to $47.11.Energy stocks saw the most powerful gains, however, as oil and gas prices jumped due to the turmoil in Japan and Bahrain.Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, was up 4.8 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips, the energy group, added 4 per cent to $76.72. The S&P energy sector jumped 3.1 per cent.Material stocks also saw strong gains. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.4 per cent to $52 as copper prices rose due to subsiding global panic. Cliff Natural Resources was up 5.8 per cent to $88.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.4 per cent higher to 11,774.51 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,636.05 in the session.Still, strategists warned that this was not the end of the pullback in US equities and the market was still in a corrective phase. “The averages will probably work their way a bit lower in the coming weeks, but we are probably more than halfway through the corrections,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The S&P is still down 5.2 per cent since its mid-February high before the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa. The index is down 2.3 per cent over the week, but still up 1.3 per cent since the start of the year. The previous session saw the index fall into negative territory for the year for the first time.The Vix index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 10.4 per cent in the session. It is up 30.8 per cent over the week and 60 per cent above mid-February lows. Elsewhere, technology stocks saw gains, rebounding from a week of sharp losses.Qualcomm, which lost 4.7 per cent in the previous session, was up 3.6 per cent to $52.32 after the mobile-phone chipmaker said it sees limited impact from the Japanese disaster.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Apple was up 1.4 per cent to $334.64 while Hewlett-Packard gained 3.2 per cent to $41.40. The S&P technology index was up 1 per cent, paring some of the 2.7 per cent fall previously in the week.In corporate news Winnebago Industries, the motor home manufacturer, reported a surprising 3.6 per cent decline in second- quarter revenue, sending the stock down 12 per cent to $13.37. The company blamed weakening consumer confidence caused by volatility in gas prices for the fall. Elsewhere Guess, the clothing retailer, gave a weak outlook both for earnings this year and for the current quarter’s results. The company also reported lower comparable sales at its larger US retail business declined. Shares were down 14 per cent to $37.71.
299;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Wall St falls on Japan’s nuclear crisis;;"General Electric, Aflac and Halliburton were among the many stocks pulled lower as traders sold US equities on worries over the burgeoning nuclear crisis in Japan.All 10 of the S&P sectors were hit as investors turned away from risky assets following two more explosions at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and warnings from the prime minister of “substantial” radiation leaks.Industrial stocks saw some of the heaviest losses. GE, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant, was one of the worst-performing stocks on the S&P, fell 1.6 per cent to $19.61.Related stocks also lost ground. 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $89.50 while Caterpillar was 1.3 per cent lower to $100.75. The S&P industrial index dropped 1.1 per cent.Some strategists argued that the industrial sell-off was surprising given that the sector might eventually benefit from the disaster. “In the medium term, some of these suppliers are going to be turned to the rebuilding effort,” said Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management.Elsewhere on Wall Street, insurers faced heavy selling on fears over the mounting costs of the natural disaster in Japan. Aflac was down 5.6 per cent to $50.89, making it the worst-performing stock on the S&P index, while Platinum Underwriters lost 1.2 per cent to $36.26. The KBW property casualty index was 1.3 per cent lower.Energy stocks fell away as oil prices softened on fears that a nuclear crisis would hamper global economic growth. Halliburton an oilfield services company, was down 2.3 per cent to $44.01 while ConocoPhillips was 1.1 per cent lower to $74.98. This left the S&P energy index 0.8 per cent softer, while the S&P 500 fell 1.1 per cent to 1,281.87 at the close, a six-week low.But the losses had been far more severe earlier in the session. The S&P tanked 2.1 per cent in the minutes after opening, but then edged higher through the rest of the session.The markets were given a boost following a statement by the Federal Reserve on monetary policy. The monetary policy committee voted unanimously to keep interest rates steady, complete the current round of quantitative easing and said that the economy was on a “firmer footing”.“They came to the conclusion that there was no justification to rocking the
boat in the wake of ongoing development,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.The S&P 500 index has fallen 4.6 per cent in the past three weeks, with the feared effects of the disaster adding to concerns over oil supplies following the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. It is still up 1.9 per cent this year.Commentators trying to weigh up the impact of the disaster generally struck a more pessimistic tone than on Monday. Analysts at Citigroup estimated that the total damage to infrastructure could be as high as Y5,000bn-Y10,000bn.However, most added that the long-term prospects for US equities were positive. The “long-term real returns from stocks remain attractive, in our opinion, when compared with other assets, such as cash or Treasury bonds,” said strategists at PNC in a note.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.2 per cent to 11,855.42, a six-week low, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3 per cent to 2,667.33.The Vix index, a measure of volatility, rose 13 per cent to a six-month high in a sign that traders foresee more turbulence in the pipelines.In the technology sector Apple was down 2.3 per cent to $345.43 while Yahoo fell 5.7 per cent to $16.33.Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker after Intel, tumbled 1.9 per cent to $33.90 after saying that the “substantial” damage to one of its plants in Japan from the earthquake will hurt sales in the first and second quarters.The S&P technology sector was 1.8 per cent lower with traders retreating from a sector that has climbed 35 per cent in the six months from early September.All those companies with exposure to nuclear energy were badly hit for the second consecutive session. Uranium Resources lost 9.7 per cent to $1.58, adding to the 24.7 per cent fall in the previous session.Renewable energy stocks added to gains in the previous session as traders sought to capitalise on any backlash against nuclear power. First Solar was up 8.2 per cent to $158.91 while Suntech Power was up 9.9 per cent to $9.10.MEMC Electronic Materials was down 3.1 per cent to $12.95 in the session, but the silicon maker is still up 8.1 per cent over the last two days."
300;COP;Conocophillips;2011-03-08T22:08:06Z;Wall Street rises as oil fears ease;;Boeing gained ground after the group signed a multibillion-dollar deal with two airlines in China while US equities bounced back from recent losses as oil prices softened.The aerospace and defence company announced a deal to sell 43 large passenger jets worth up to $10bn to two Chinese airlines.Air China, the country’s flag-carrier, agreed to buy five of Boeing’s new 747-8 Intercontinental jets while Hong Kong Airlines placed a preliminary order for 38 planes.The news came just weeks after Boeing secured a $35bn deal to supply the US Air Force with refuelling aircraft, beating its European rival EADS.Its shares were up 1.6 per cent to $72.04, adding to the 8.6 per cent gains since the start of the year.Elsewhere in the sector, Lockheed Martin was up 1.2 per cent to $80.27 while United Technologies rose 1.2 per cent to $83.26. The S&P aerospace and defence sector was up 1.6 per cent.The S&P 500 index was up 0.9 per cent at 1,321.82 as the oil price fell on news that key oil producing nations were boosting their production to make up for lost supply out of Libya.The S&P 500 is still down 1.6 per cent since its mid-February highs on fears that elevated oil prices caused by the troubles in North Africa and the Middle East could damage the domestic economic recovery.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 12,214.46 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7 per cent to 2,765.77.Some strategists argued that this rally for US equities would be short-lived as turmoil in the oil markets looked set to continue.“While we might have a day or two of stable or falling oil prices, the situation in North Africa and the Middle East is far from over,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “Oil prices are likely to climb higher, which in turn will put further short term pressure of equities.”Financial and industrial stocks were some of the chief beneficiaries of the upturn in risk appetite in the session.General Electric added 1.2 per cent to $20.62 while 3M put on 1.5 per cent to $93.75. The S&P industrial index was up 1.5 per cent.Financial stocks saw even sharper gains with the S&P sub-index adding 2.2 per cent. PNC Financial Services gained 4.4 per cent to $63.37 while Zions Bancorporation rose 2.9 per cent to $23.14.Bank of America added 4.7 per cent to $14.69, helped by comments from Brian Moynihan, chief executive, at the bank’s first investor day conference since 2007.Mr Moynihan said he believed the bank had the ability to earn between $35bn and $40bn a year in pre-tax earnings when the business normalises, a figure significantly higher than any earnings reported in the past 15 years.The bank lost $1.3bn in 2010 and earned $4.4bn pre-tax in 2008 and 2009. In 2007, it earned $20.9bn, in 2006 $32bn and in 2005 $24.5bn.Mr Moynihan also said that the bank had no intentions of making any more acquisitions and instead would focus on returning “every dollar” in capital to shareholders through regular dividends, share buy-backs and special cash dividends.Only the energy sector lost ground in the session due to the lower oil prices.Marathon Oil was down 2.4 per cent to $50.18 while Conocophillips, another oil company, was down 1.1 per cent to $78.32. The S&P energy sector lost 0.6 per cent, although it is still up 13 per cent over the year.In corporate news, shares in Urban Outfitters lost ground after the retailer reported fourth-quarter sales and profit that fell short of expectations.The company reported earnings per share of 45 cents, falling short of the 52 cents expected on Wall Street. Its shares tumbled 16.7 per cent to $31.66.Analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note: “[Urban Outfitters is] a great long-term growth story but we are still more guarded on the near-term, given uncompelling valuation . . . risks of higher sourcing costs, and potential difficulty navigating through fashion shifts.”Elsewhere in the retail sector, Casey’s General Stores fell 7 per cent to $37.71 after reporting third-quarter earnings of 37 cents a share, falling short of the 49 cents a share expected by Wall Street.McDonald’s reported that same-store sales had risen by 3.9 per cent worldwide in February. This was ahead of expectations but its shares were down 1 per cent to $75.55 after like-for-like sales growth in US fell short of forecasts.
301;COP;Conocophillips;2011-02-27T20:37:24Z;Exxon urges US to resume deepwater drilling;;ExxonMobil, the largest US oil company, backed by industry groups, has urged regulators to allow deep­water drilling to resume in the Gulf of Mexico, as the turmoil in north Africa raises the pressure on the US to develop its own sources of supply.The US authorities have been sending mixed messages about the resumption of drilling, which was suspended after the BP oil spill last year.The formal moratorium was lifted in October but no permits for new oil and gas wells have been issued. BHP Billiton, the mining and energy group, had an application turned down earlier this month.Ken Cohen, Exxon’s vice-president for public affairs, said: “We are the only part of the world that put its industry on standby after the spill . . . The industry has given every assurance that it can operate safely.”Ken Salazar, secretary of the interior, and Michael Bromwich, head of the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, reviewed in Houston on Friday the two new oil spill response systems, including the Marine Well Containment Company, which is backed by Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and Conoco­Phillips.On the visit, Mr Bromwich said: “I’m quite confident that we’re getting very close to the point where we can begin issuing deep­water permits.”Yet Mr Salazar seemed to contradict him, saying the oil industry had yet to convince him.Mr Salazar added that he would not “respond to political pressure”.He said: “These containment systems are a work in progress. Both systems currently have limitations on water depth and barrel-per-day containment capability.”Some Republicans and Democrats in Congress are urging a resumption of activity in the gulf as fuel costs climb.The average price of petrol at the pump in the US rose about 5 cents per gallon to about $3.19 last week, its highest level since October 2008.Allowing deepwater drilling to resume in the gulf would have no immediate impact on oil supplies. It can take five to 10 years for a new discovery to be commercially developed.However, Martin Regalia, the chief economist of the US Chamber of Commerce, the business lobby group, said: “What we should have done six years ago is to exploit fully the oil resources that we have. If we exploit our own resources – in a responsible way – then we would not be held hostage when something unexpected happens abroad.”Rodolfo Guzman, director with Arthur D. Little Energy Practice in Houston, said: “The US cannot afford to shut down one of its key sources of energy supply, particularly when one region it imports from is going into a period of instability.”
302;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oil groups draw up plans for swift Libya exit;;The oil sector in Libya was descending into chaos on Monday as the revolt against Muammer Gaddafi called into question the industry’s rush to the oil-rich north African country over the past few years.International companies including BP, Royal Dutch Shell and BASF said they were either cutting production or pulling out staff, while analysts said companies could face long-term problems whether the regime survived or fell.Other companies said their operations were normal for the time being, but oil executives privately said they were implementing emergency plans to withdraw all staff and shut down output.The petroleum sector is a crucial political and economic backdrop to the struggle against Colonel Gaddafi’s 41-year rule. It accounts for almost all Libya’s export earnings and is the main emblem of the leader’s partial detente with the west. John Hamilton, co-author of a report last year entitled Libya’s Energy Future, said: “This is the only show in town. Without the oil companies, they really have nothing.”After the arrival of some European companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, oil companies have flocked more recently to Libya’s 1.7m-barrel-a-day industry – making it the world’s 12th-largest oil exporter – since international sanctions against operating there were lifted in 2004. They did so with the blessing of western politicians such as Tony Blair, former British prime minister, who was present as BP signed a $900m exploration agreement with Libya in 2007.The industry in Libya is now a veritable UN of oil, with companies represented including Brazil’s Petrobras, Gazprom of Russia and a clutch of US businesses, such as ConocoPhillips, Amerada Hess and Marathon. European companies, such as Eni of Italy, Repsol YPF of Spain and Total of France, which arrived ahead of the lifting of sanctions in 2004, are leaders in the country.Despite the promise of Libya’s proximity to European export markets, the industry has not been able to repeat the bonanza of oil discoveries of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The last round of exploration had not returned the promised boom in new discoveries, leaving some companies disappointed. Oil companies have also complained about the increasingly erratic behaviour of Libya’s national oil company – a partner in joint ventures with foreign oil groups – and higher taxes. Executives also complain about a rise in bureaucracy.Now those commercial failures have been exacerbated by worries over the protests – and, in particular, a violent response that Human Rights Watch claims has killed more than 200 people.While Libya’s main oil exploration and production areas are either offshore or in parts of the country away from the main protests in the east, these could yet spread or affect supply lines.Were the regime to fall, analysts say the companies could face uncertainty over the security of contracts, because – unlike in neighbouring energy producers Algeria and Tunisia – Libya’s governance is so personalised in the leader that many state institutions are fragile and would struggle to function independently.Even if the regime reasserts its authority, any reprisals would trigger even more international condemnation of it and those who worked with it.As Claire Spencer, head of the Middle East and north Africa programme at Chatham House, the London-based foreign policy institute, put it: “Even if Gaddafi stays in place now, this is not going to be the last we hear of civil unrest. And if he is forced to retreat, who is going to run the place?”Additional reporting by Ed Crook in New York and Sheila McNulty in Houston
303;COP;Conocophillips;2011-02-17T17:38:51Z;Oil spill response system launched;;Oil companies on Thursday launched a spill containment system in the Gulf of Mexico in a bid to restart the issuance of permits stalled after BP’s fatal Macondo well disaster.ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips unveiled the interim containment system, which they said was open to all operators in the gulf. A second response system, by Helix Energy Solutions Group, is to be ready at the end of March.The move comes in the wake of the first bankruptcy to emerge from the slowdown in drilling imposed by regulators in the Gulf of Mexico, which have increased tensions between the oil industry and the Obama administration.Seahawk Drilling, a gulf-focused driller, is filing for bankruptcy as part of a deal to sell its 20 shallow-water, or jackup, rigs to Hercules Offshore in a deal valued at $105m.Randy Stilley, Seahawk’s chief executive, took a parting shot at regulators: “The decision by regulators to arbitrarily construct unnecessary barriers to obtaining permits they had traditionally authorised has had an adverse impact not only on Seahawk but on the sector as a whole.’’The Obama administration issued a moratorium on gulf drilling following BP’s fatal Macondo disaster in April 2010. But even though the moratorium has been lifted, activity remains constrained.Michael Bromwich, the gulf’s lead regulator, said he would not issue any deepwater drilling permits until the industry had an adequate spill response system in place: “It would simply be irresponsible.’’While those operating in the deep water are bigger and can hold out longer, Mr Bromwich also has taken a hardline on shallow-water drilling. Permitting has slowed from up to 20 a month before the oil spill disaster to 31 in the 10 months since the accident.Mr Bromwich played down what he called “a new normal”, telling an oil industry conference on Friday there was no backlog of permits awaiting approval. But the companies accused him of misrepresenting the situation.“He’s being a little coy,”’ said Gary Luquette, head of North American production for Chevron. “No, there isn’t a big backlog because you couldn’t get a straight answer as to what it took to get a permit. The demand is there, and, if we can ever get the framework agreed and set down, it’s going to be like drinking out of a fire hose.’’While some rigs have left the gulf, the fees to do so are high – up to $15m for a shallow rig to go to Asia, for example.Nonetheless, John Rynd, chief executive of Hercules, said he agreed to buy rival Seahawk’s 20 rigs with a goal toward eventually moving some of them out of the gulf and into international regions where it is operating.Hercules is a global provider of offshore contract drilling, liftboat and inland barge services with operations in nine countries. Mr Rynd said regulatory uncertainty has put drillers in the gulf under enormous stress.“I think it’s going to be a slow process to get rigs back to work,’’ he said. “You can’t get clarity on what the government is asking for.’’He noted that 45 days into 2011, only 12 permits had been issued: “It’s very inefficient.’’“We’re very concerned,’’ said Jim Noe, executive director of the Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition. With many operators in shallow waters private, there is no public announcement when they go under, he said. But he predicts more bankruptcies.“Seahawk is a poster child for what happens when you shut down permitting,’’ he said. “Business has completely dried up.’’Meanwhile, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement said it was investigating an incident on Apache Corporation’s natural gas production platform off Lake Charles, Louisiana, on February 16 in which a worker died after falling in to the water apparently while being transferred from a vessel to the platform.“This tragic accident underscores why we are continuing to work with the industry to ensure the highest safety standards on offshore facilities,” Mr Bromwich said.
304;COP;Conocophillips;2011-02-16T02:27:42Z;Exxon deal highlights oil reserves issue;;ExxonMobil’s acquisition of XTO Energy last year accounted for 80 per cent of the reserves it added in 2010, highlighting the difficulty oil companies are having in finding new sources of crude.The world’s largest private sector oil company by market capitalisation said its reserve base increased by 3.5bn to 24.8bn oil-equivalent barrels at the end of last year. XTO, a US independent focused on shale gas production, accounted for 2.8bn of the new reserves.The additions enabled Exxon to replace 209 per cent of production.Barclays Capital noted that excluding the XTO acquisition, Exxon’s reserve replacement ratio would have been only 45 per cent.“We think the poor organic replacement ratio could reignite the question among some investors whether Exxon acquired XTO purely for reserves and production growth,’’ said Paul Cheng, an analyst covering Exxon at Barclays Capital.The issue of how the world’s biggest oil companies will increase reserves has become increasingly important amid the resource nationalism that has put up barriers to new sources. This has pushed the top companies into deeper water and unconventional fuels. But it also has led to a variety of strategic decisions to address the problem.Exxon has focused on acquiring resources. Chevron has committed to investing heavily to generate organic growth. And ConocoPhillips has been selling assets to improve its mix and put it on a path to faster production growth.Exxon maintains that it leads the industry in reserves replacement.Conoco reported last month 2010 organic net proved reserve additions of 920m barrels of oil equivalent for an organic reserve replacement ratio of 138 per cent of 2010 production. Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, said the company’s development of unconventional North American resources was key.“We concentrated much of our drilling and development activity on liquids prospects, given the strength of the oil market, and succeeded in adding significant reserves from our oil sands properties in Canada and our assets in Alaska,” Mr Mulva said.“In addition, significant gas reserves were added in Qatar. These successes reconfirm the viability of our strategic focus on organic development.”Chevron reported reserves replacement of just 24 per cent but analysts were forgiving, noting its strong pipeline of upcoming projects in places such as Australia and the Gulf of Mexico. Chevron added 240m barrels of net oil equivalent reserves last year.“Chevron remains a core long-term holding,” said Edward Westlake, analyst at Credit Suisse Global Energy. Exxon stresses that the long-term nature of the industry and the large size of the projects that provide a significant portion of reserves additions make it appropriate to consider a time horizon longer than a single year.
305;COP;Conocophillips;2011-02-12T00:18:21Z;US offshore oil regulator sits on Gulf permits;;Michael Bromwich, the lead regulator of the US offshore oil industry, said that no new deepwater drilling permits would be issued f or the Gulf of Mexico until companies had an adequate spill response system in place.“It would simply be irresponsible to approve deepwater drilling,” Mr Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, told an oil industry conference on Friday. “The industry knows the containment capabilities are not there yet.”The industry has been pressing for a return to deepwater drilling, which has been on hold since BP’s Macondo disaster last April. The major oil companies insist the accident was not indicative of a systematic problem with the safety of deepwater drilling but rather a one-off event.John Watson, Chevron’s chief executive, expressed his impatience last month when he stressed, “the time’s about up” to receive new permits.Mr Bromwich dismissed the assertion that the BP accident was an isolated incident, noting that there had been 79 loss of well-control incidents in the Gulf since 1996. “That’s not one in a million.”The major oil companies, led by ExxonMobil, have been moving to create a marine well containment system to respond to any future incidents in the Gulf. Mr Bromwich said it would be tested next week.Exxon said on Friday that it is working to finalise the interim response system and agreements with prospective participants. The company is meeting regulators to ensure the systems are designed to fulfil the government’s requirements.The interim system will be available while an expanded containment response system is being developed by ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell.A second response system, by Helix Energy Solutions Group, is expected to be ready at the end of March.Mr Bromwich regarded the need to review these systems as a “national priority”.He said the regulator was working on a number of improvements to strengthen its oversight, given that regulators had failed to keep pace with the transformation of the offshore drilling industry as it moved into deeper water. He noted that UK production had dropped off substantially for two years after the Piper Alpha accident there, almost coming to a standstill.“I believe deepwater drilling will be approved in the near future,” he said.While he did not expect further emergency rules to be imposed on the industry, Mr Bromwich said that regulations would have to keep pace with the advances expected as the industry moved into deep water with higher pressures.The issuance of permits would never return to levels seen before the accident, he said, when many viewed regulators as a “permitting mill”’ without adequate reviews. “We have a new normal: it’s going to take more time than in the past.”
306;COP;Conocophillips;2011-02-11T23:06:47Z;Kinder Morgan IPO raises $2.9bn;;Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline operator, has sold shares in its initial public offering above the projected range and is set to raise some $2.9bn, the largest-ever private equity-backed share offering in the US.The shares opened at $31.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, but fell slightly later. They ended the day at $31.05, up 3.5 per cent from their sale price of $30.The sale represents a significant profit for the group of private equity firms that along with Rich Kinder, chief executive, took the company private in 2006. The company is not receiving any of the proceeds of the sale.The offering, underwritten by Goldman Sachs and Barclays, priced above its projected range of $26 to $29 a share. The company issued 15m shares more than the original 80m planned. If an overallotment of 14.3m shares is exercised, the value of the deal could rise to about $3.3bn.Mr Kinder and the private equity firms, which included funds owned by Goldman Sachs, Carlyle Group, Riverstone Holdings and Highstar Capital, took the company private in 2006 for $22bn, which included $15bn in equity along with $7bn in debt.The offering at $30 a share valued the company at $21bn, with 707m common shares outstanding. The company projects to have $12bn in debt at year end.This year, private equity groups are expected to sell shares in several of the large buy-outs undertaken in 2005 and 2006, at the peak of the credit bubble.Kinder Morgan’s sale tops the $1.8bn IPO of Nielsen, the media measurement group, in January. A $4.2bn IPO of HCA, the hospital chain, is also expected in the first quarter.The Kinder deal is also the largest IPO of a US energy group since Conoco sold $4.4bn worth of shares in 1998.Mr Kinder is a one-time Enron executive who bought its physical pipeline assets in 1996 to form Kinder Morgan. He is not selling any of his 30.6 per cent stake in the company. After the offering, Mr Kinder and the private equity firms will still own more than 80 per cent of the company.The Kinder Morgan entity going public is a holding company that owns the general partner stake in publicly listed Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, a master limited partnership (MLP) that operates some 37,000 miles of pipes shipping oil, gas and other commodities.The holding company will be renamed Kinder Morgan Inc, to trade under the symbol ‘KMI’. KMI also owns a stake in a pipeline. The shares will yield around 4 per cent, according to the prospectus.KMI will be the general partner and as such will participate in a greater share of any future increases in the partnership’s dividend payments. Also, it will not be subject to ownership restriction rules that are faced by MLPs, which many pension and non-US investors cannot buy into.Other high-yielding shares have done well in trading. Shares in Targa Resources, another similarly structured private-equity backed natural gas infrastructure group, are up 39 per cent since their offering last February.“There’s also a lot of buzz about natural gas and whether with oil prices rising, it’s going to become a more important fuel in the future,” said Nick Einhorn, analyst at Renaissance Capital, the US-based IPO research group.

308;COP;Conocophillips;2011-02-04T01:36:04Z;Kinder Morgan aims for $2.3bn IPO;;Kinder Morgan, the pipeline operator, aims to launch the largest-ever US initial public offering of a company backed by private equity groups, of up to $2.3bn.The company, which was taken private by its chief executive and a group of private equity firms in 2006, announced on Thursday in a regulatory filing that it intends to sell 80m shares in a price range of $26 to $29 a share.At that size, it would top last month’s $1.8bn IPO of Nielsen, the media measurement group. That deal supplanted Spirit Aerosystem’s 2006 offering as the largest-ever share sale of a US company backed by private-equity investors.It will also be the largest IPO of a US energy group since Conoco sold $4.4bn worth of shares in 1998.The shares being sold are owned by private equity funds controlled by Goldman Sachs, the Carlyle Group, Riverstone Holdings and Highstar Capital. The company will not receive any of the proceeds.The firms were partners in the leveraged buy-out alongside its chief executive, Rich Kinder. The group acquired the company for $15bn, taking on $7bn in debt. Together, the firms own roughly 60 per cent of the shares.Mr Kinder is a one-time Enron executive who bought its physical pipeline assets in 1996 to form Kinder Morgan. He will not be selling any of his 30.6 per cent stake.After the offering, Mr Kinder and the firms will still own 88.7 per cent of the company. The offering is in the marketing phase, and is tentatively scheduled for February 11, according to a market source.The entity going public is a holding company that owns the general partner stake in publicly listed Kinder Morgan Partners, a master limited partnership (MLP) that operates some 37,000 miles of pipes shipping oil, gas and other commodities.The holding company will be renamed Kinder Morgan, Inc, to trade under the symbol ‘KMI' on the New York Stock Exchange. KMI also owns a stake in a pipeline.KMI, the new public entity, will offer a lower yield, of 4.25 per cent at the midpoint IPO prices, versus the existing public entity’s yield of 6 per cent, according to the filing. However, KMI will be the general partner stake, and as such will participate in a greater share of any future increases in dividend payments.KMI will also not be subject to the restrictions on MLPs, which many pension funds do not buy, and which many foreign funds cannot own under US rules.Several large private-equity backed deals filed IPOs last year, including Kinder Morgan. Toys’R’Us, the retailer, and HCA, the hospital company, are expected to follow Nielsen and debut this year if the equity markets continue to rebound and reach new highs.“When you do an IPO, a firm is still a participant in the upside of the company. If people feel the market overall is still headed up, you’ll see more of these big deals,” said Michael Laveman, a partner at EisnerAmper, an accounting advisory group.According to Dealogic, private-equity backed companies make up 54 per cent of the backlog of US IPOs filed in the past six months, with 21 deals worth $17.9bn waiting to come to market.Barclays Capital and Goldman Sachs are lead underwriters on the deal.
309;COP;Conocophillips;2011-01-31T23:08:07Z;Oil companies choose different paths;;"The three largest US oil groups may be facing the same problems in securing access to conventional sources of oil and gas but they have each chosen a different response.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest private sector oil company by market capitalisation, has made a large acquisition to give it a position in US “unconventional” gas, paying $41bn including debt for XTO. Chevron, the second largest by the same measure, has committed to investing heavily to generate organic growth. ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, has chosen the most radical route, of “shrinking to grow”: making disposals to improve its mix of assets and put it on a path to faster production growth.Investors’ reactions to these three approaches have been reflected in the companies’ share prices over the past year.Exxon saw its share price rise 7 per cent; Chevron recorded a 19 per cent rise; but ConocoPhillips saw its share price surge 33 per cent. As Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy, puts it: “The jury is starting to come in.”Exxon’s commitment to US natural gas has not looked like a good move in the short term, given that strong supplies have continued to push US gas prices down. The company is playing a long game, however: betting both that low prices will force relatively high-cost producers out of the industry, tightening supplies, and that US demand for gas will rise strongly.Exxon argued on Monday that gas would win out over coal for power generation in the long term, in part because it is less polluting. In particular, gas creates lower carbon dioxide emissions, which Exxon expects will at some point be reflected in the costs faced by generators.That is a significant shift in its thinking given its previous scepticism about policy to combat climate change, particularly under its previous chief executive Lee Raymond, who stepped down at the end of 2005.Exxon appears to have been pushed towards unconventional gas, in part because, Mr West argues, it has not been as good at commercial relationships as Chevron. In the past year, Exxon suffered a high-profile failure to get into Ghana’s Jubilee oilfield after opposition from the country’s government.It remains embroiled in a long-running battle to be compensated for the nationalisation of its assets in Venezuela.Exxon has been living for years off strong reserve replacement from projects in Qatar that it inherited from Mobil following the 1999 acquisition, Mr West said. And while that deal was “brilliant”, the reserves from that are becoming fully developed.“They have to find a ‘new Mobil’ to replace reserves, and this has proven difficult,’’ he added.Exxon has also suffered a setback in its efforts to find conventional, if challenging, oil reserves off the coast of Brazil; a region where other companies have scored huge successes. It has drilled three costly and unsuccessful wells there.Chevron, meanwhile, is investing heavily and starting up a large portfolio of new projects. This year, it is boosting capital expenditure to a record $26bn, up from $21.6bn in 2010.With less than half of Exxon’s market capitalisation, it is investing at about 80 per cent of Exxon’s $32.2bn last year.Among its largest commitments are its large investment programmes in Australia: the Gorgon and Wheatstone liquefied natural gas projects.Edward Westlake, analyst at Credit Suisse Global Energy, said: “The company is in the midst of a capex programme that should drive best-in-class cash flow even higher when new projects come on stream from 2014 onwards.”The most interesting approach of all, however, may have been Conoco’s. It spent 2009-10 executing a $15bn asset and joint venture divestiture programme that left it with $7bn-$10bn in free net cash proceeds.Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank, holds up its effort to sell non-core assets – something also being done by BP, by necessity – as especially pleasing to investors. Indeed, he wonders if others might consider this strategy.“BP’s route has shown that from the point it began pursuing a shrink-to-grow strategy, its stock has torn [ahead],’’ Mr Sankey said. “Conoco, too. So Total, Shell and Chevron have to ask if being big is worth it.”"
310;COP;Conocophillips;2011-01-26T17:23:58Z;Oil majors;Big Oil is drowning in cash. It’s time to do something radical with it;"Another year, another gusher of cash from Big Oil. ConocoPhillips set the tone on Wednesday, reporting a near trebling of earnings for 2010, to $11.4bn, with ExxonMobil, Shell and others still to come. The integrated oil majors sail serenely on, as supertankers tend to do. Yet BP’s calamity in the Gulf of Mexico, a rising regulatory burden, stubbornly high costs, and relatively poor shareholder returns suggest the sector could do with a dose of innovative thinking.Returns for investors in oil and gas companies have been consistent but hardly stellar, given near $100 a barrel oil. Of the largest, only Shell has clawed back to the sector’s May 2008 share price high. ExxonMobil is 16 per cent off that peak, and BP is 24 per cent below. Integrated oil companies trade between 7 and 14 times current earnings; for pure exploration and production and oil services groups the multiples go up to 20.The sector is actually ticking the right boxes in pursuit of returns for shareholders. Cash generation is impressive, dividend yields are comfortably covered and the pace of disposals picked up markedly in 2010. Oil and gas companies sold about $40bn of assets, to independent E&P operators or national oil companies. That trend will continue: ConocoPhillips is selling some of its North American assets and Eni has indicated it wants to sell its stake in Portugal’s Galp. As Credit Suisse notes, such moves achieve current market values on often under-appreciated assets.Yet it all smacks more of portfolio management than of restructuring. If Big Oil wants to boost returns, it should pursue Marathon’s option of separating upstream from downstream. Deutsche Bank estimates that European oil companies, for example, trade at a 30 per cent discount to their sum of-the parts valuations. How about some radical ideas this reporting season to accompany those rivers of cash?E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
311;COP;Conocophillips;2011-01-26T14:38:04Z;Conoco benefits from higher oil prices;;ConocoPhillips, the US’s third-largest oil company by production, on Thursday reported net profit of $2bn in the fourth quarter of 2010, up from $1.3bn in the same period a year earlier.Higher oil prices, organic growth and asset sales improved the company’s bottom line.Excluding gains from asset dispositions, impairments and other items, its adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.9bn, or $1.32 per share.For the full-year 2010, Conoco reported $11.4bn in earnings, more than double the $4.4bn reported in 2009. Excluding gains from asset dispositions and other items, adjusted earnings in 2010 were $8.8bn.“We improved our returns, reduced debt and increased shareholder distributions,’” said Jim Mulva, ConocoPhillips’ chief executive. Conoco exceeded its goal to replace its 2010 production with new organic reserves.The company said its exploration and production segment’s organic reserve replacement ratio is expected to be 138 per cent of 2010 production. Much of that is due to Conoco’s development of North American unconventional resources, including shale and oil sands.After the economic crisis exposed weaknesses in Conoco’s grow-through-acquisition strategy, the company has slimmed down and moved its focus to growth through exploration and production.In 2010, it generated $15.4bn from dispositions, with $8.3bn of that from its sale of Lukoil shares and $7.1bn from asset sales.
312;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Big oil groups forecast to spend $128bn;;The world’s five largest publicly listed oil companies are expected to spend a record $128bn on capital investment over the next 12 months as they seek to boost production growth and capitalise on high crude prices.The aggressive forecast, from Jason Kenney, an Edinburgh-based oil and gas analyst at ING, comes as ConocoPhillips of the US prepares to kick off the annual reporting season later this week. All the big groups are expected to produce strong results due to the high oil prices.Mr Kenney said he expected the top five – ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total of France – to spend $128.54bn this year, compared with a forecast $117.35bn in 2010 and more than the previous record of $127bn in 2008.Other analysts also expect a spending boom.“The taps will be turned on after relatively lacklustre investments over the past 18 months. I would expect a 10-15 per cent increase in capital investment by the supermajors as planning assumptions move higher,” said Theepan Jothilingam at Morgan Stanley.He expects 2011 to be “a banner year for offshore exploration activity”, but cautions that the industry will also face “increased maintenance costs and downtime” after BP’s spill last year in the Gulf of Mexico.Among the US companies, Chevron has already boosted its capex target for this year to $26bn, a $4.4bn increase from 2010. That is the most Chevron has ever budgeted for capex and puts its spending within the range set by the much larger Exxon, which has said it plans to spend $25bn-$35bn a year.Paul Sankey, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said Chevron’s willingness to spend at the same rate as Exxon reflects a strong portfolio of projects in its pipeline.However, with just under 10 per cent of Chevron’s total net production is in the Gulf of Mexico, and with continued regulatory uncertainty about issuing new drilling permits, the company could find it tough to add significantly more barrels.Exxon, meanwhile, is in a strong position to capitalise on its Qatar operations, he said, as well as its purchase of XTO, the US natural gas producer, last year.Asset disposals are also expected to feature heavily this year as the big companies divest non-core holdings to focus on higher-value production and strengthen their balance sheets.ConocoPhillips has already sold some assets as part of a strategy to focus on organic growth. UK peer BP has already raised close to its target of $30bn to help pay for the Gulf of Mexico spill, while Royal Dutch Shell is also selling non-core assets.Bob Dudley, BP’s new chief executive, will set out a new group strategy next month.He is expected to resume dividend payments, albeit at a lower rate than before the spill.Rival Shell is expected to reap the benefits of recent investment spending and has 13 projects due to start producing oil and gas by the end of 2011.Offshore exploration is expected to feature heavily this year. “In 2014, about 63 per cent of the majors’ new source production is forecast to come from the offshore – shallow water and deepwater,’’ said Rebecca Fitz, senior manager of the Upstream & Gas Group at PFC Energy, the consultancy.Despite the BP spill, deepwater remains a key focus, reflecting the reality that new reserves are predominantly in tough, deepwater areas.Risks and costs, however, are also expected to increase after the BP spill. A survey of senior oil and gas executives by GL Noble Denton and the Economist Intelligence Unit found that the majority expect regulation to become more stringent in North America, as well as costs to rise in general.“Regulatory uncertainty emerges as a key industry albatross.“There is widespread concern that legislation will hamper investment in organic growth areas, not just in the Gulf of Mexico,” said the report.
313;COP;Conocophillips;2011-01-20T18:59:47Z;Occidental wins Shah gas fields contract;;Abu Dhabi has awarded the lead contract to develop its troubled Shah sour gas project to Occidental Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil company in the US, the United Arab Emirates news agency has announced.Occidental will take a 40 per cent position in the Abu Dhabi Gas Development Company Limited alongside the state-controlled Abu Dhabi National Oil Company with 60 per cent.The company is the structure established to develop the Shah project, from which ConocoPhillips pulled out last year citing unappealing economics. The project cost is put at $10bn.Occidental beat competing bids to develop Shah from ExxonMobil, Shell and Total, but the price it has been able to extract from the Abu Dhabi side was not disclosed in Thursday’s announcement.Gas from the Shah field, which lies approximately 180km south-west of the city of Abu Dhabi, is difficult and costly to extract, as it has a high content of hydrogen sulphide.But the gas is badly needed in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates because of spiralling energy demand and the need to reinject to maintain oilfield pressure. Gas from Shah is non-associated, or separate from an oilfield.The UAE is pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy in the petrochemical, steel and aluminium industries. However, Abu Dhabi has grown used to cheap, subsidised gas.It pays $1.25 per million British thermal units, a common industry measurement, to Qatar for gas from the Dolphin pipeline. This price is estimated to cover only a quarter of the estimated price of sulphur extraction from Shah.Conoco is understood to have agreed terms under which it was to have been paid $5 per million Btu to extract the gas. Analysts speculated this week that Abu Dhabi would have to pay as much as $8 in current market conditions.Abu Dhabi has managed to make some progress in developing Shah. In May last year Adnoc awarded Saipem of Italy three contracts worth about $3.1bn for a gas processing plant, sulphur recovery and product pipelines, while South Korea’s Samsung Engineering won a $1.5bn contract for the utilities and off-site package.Adnoc awarded a $463m gas gathering package to a consortium of Spain’s Técnicas Reunidas and Punj Lloyd of India. The agreement with Occidental involves “several gas gathering systems, construction of processing trains to process one billion cubic feet per day of gas,” the UAE state news agency said.It had been hoped that Shah would start producing gas around 2013, with a production target for gas sales of between 500m and 700m cubic feet per day.
314;COP;Conocophillips;2011-01-17T17:57:44Z;Abu Dhabi wrestles with gas dilemma;;When Conoco­Phillips announced last April that it was ending an agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to produce sour gas from the Shah field, one of the toughest hydrocarbon deals in the Middle East was back on the table.The US company signed an agreement in 2008 to develop Shah, 180km south-west of Abu Dhabi city, beating competition from Royal Dutch Shell and Occidental Petroleum. The total project cost was estimated at about $10bn.But as Conoco’s withdrawal illustrates, Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates’ capital, faces one of the trickiest gas development dilemmas in the region.Gas is vital to the diversification that the UAE hopes will decrease reliance in the long term on hydrocarbons and boost employment opportunities.But the supply-demand equation for gas is particularly tight. This is because of spiralling electricity consumption, caused by a growing population and demand in the petrochemical, steel and aluminium industries, combined with the need for substantial reinjection of gas into oilfields.Almost half of Abu Dhabi’s daily gas output, or 3.3bn cubic feet a day out of a total of 7.8bn cu ft, is reinjected. Power demand in the UAE is surging at roughly 2 gigawatts a year.But Shah gas is difficult and costly to extract as it has a high content of hydrogen sulphide.Samuel Ciszuk, senior Middle East and North Africa energy analyst for Global Insight, says Conoco and Adnoc agreed a price of about $5 per million British thermal units for treatment of the Shah gas, “which obviously proved to be too low”, he says.An energy expert working in the UAE downstream sector says that Abu Dhabi was “shocked” by the $5 per million Btu original terms set by Conoco. But these prices were still not enough to keep the third-largest US oil company in the game.At the same time, Abu Dhabi has grown used to gas supply budgets at the $1.25 per million Btu it pays Qatar for the use of the Dolphin pipeline. This price is estimated to cover only a quarter of the putative price of sulphur extraction from Shah.Four bidders – Exxon­Mobil, Shell, Total and Occidental – are now seeking to replace Conoco as lead developer of Shah. But it remains to be seen if the 30 per cent sulphur content can be extracted economically and, if so, what price Abu Dhabi is willing to pay.“The area does not have a gas supply crisis – it has a gas pricing crisis,” says Morten Frisch, senior partner at UK-based Morten Frisch Consulting.Mr Ciszuk adds: “Other IOCs [international oil companies] are going to demand higher prices [than Conoco], but will keep a tight lid on any numbers leaking out.”The difficulty in marketing the excess sulphur produced by Shah is another problem.“There is no global price for gas. Most Middle East governments are not willing to do what the rest of the world has done: pay a price that at least encourages exploration,” says Philip Weems, Singapore managing partner for law firm King & Spalding who was based in Dubai for three years.Gas from Qatar via the Dolphin pipeline is “very, very discounted”, he says. “The old deals were done on a political rather than a commercial basis.”Such is gas’s importance to oilfield development that Abu Dhabi’s oft-touted plans to increase daily oil production to about 3m b/d have never materialised. The reinjection supplies of gas simply do not exist.The UAE has also failed to obtain further supplies from Qatar or Iran.Qatar has placed a moratorium on more exploitation of its gas reserves which makes it unlikely that it will supply the UAE further at original Dolphin price levels. It also prefers to sell on global markets to recoup heavy investment in its international liquefied natural gas supply chain.Iran, hard pressed to supply its domestic market competitively, is no longer regarded as a serious participant, says Mr Weems.“[The Shah] project is more than two years delayed,” says the downstream expert in the UAE. “Still, Adnoc sees the treatment cost as too high to finally approve. They are waiting for costs to fall, but they will have no choice.”The government must step in to make a decision for Adnoc, he believes, biting the bullet by paying about $8 per million Btu.A lawyer acting for the government of Abu Dhabi refused to comment. In the meantime, Abu Dhabi and its putative partners have no choice but to continue negotiating to reach a mutually acceptable deal.
315;COP;Conocophillips;2011-01-13T18:38:59Z;Marathon splits off refineries from exploration;;"Marathon Oil, the fourth-biggest integrated US oil and gas company, is to split into two by separating its refinery and pipeline operations from its exploration and production business.The move, which sent Marathon’s share price up $3.31, more than 8 per cent, to $43.84, joins a flurry of demergers of US groups including one announced by industrial conglomerate ITT this week. Marathon Petroleum – a newly-created company – will be the fifth-biggest refiner in the US; while Marathon Oil will focus solely on global exploration and production, with growth leveraged to crude oil production.David Pursell, head of Macro Research at Tudor Pickering Holt, the energy investment and merchant banking firm, said that as an integrated group, Marathon has had difficulty standing out.It is too small for investors to consider it a rival to other integrated groups, such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell. The split will allow each company to act in the best interest of its business segment, better attract talent and allow for more specific comparisons against competitors.Marathon’s exploration and production business can now be compared against companies such as EnCana and EOG Resources. Its refining business can be measured against pure refiners, such as Valero.“The market clearly likes the announcement,’’ Mr Pursell said.“This is a vote of confidence for other companies with similar assets to follow.’’Investors have supported other splits, including that by EnCana in 2009 and Questar in 2010. There has been talk of BP and ConocoPhillips demerging but analysts say the effort is more difficult and offers less value for companies of their scale.Marathon’s decision to split follows a long period of consideration that ended two years ago with a decision to remain integrated amid the financial crisis. “The substantial improvement in the global business and financial environments over the past two years has created the conditions under which we believe it is now appropriate to move forward with the formation of two strong independent energy companies,’’ said Clarence Cazalot Jr, Marathon president and chief executive.Marathon’s market value at Wednesday’s closing price was about $28.8bn. The company plans to distribute one share of Marathon Petroleum for every two shares of Marathon Oil. Marathon Oil will pay an initial divided of 15 cents per quarter, based on about 710m shares outstanding, and Marathon Petroleum will pay 20 cents per quarter, based on about 355m shares outstanding.The spin-off is expected to be tax-free and effective from June 30.Moody’s Investors Service placed Marathon’s Baa1 senior unsecured bond rating under review for possible downgrade, noting that the split would reduce scale and eliminate benefits of integration. Morgan Stanley is acting as financial adviser, Baker Botts as legal adviser and Bingham McCutchen as tax adviser."
316;COP;Conocophillips;2011-01-12T04:58:05Z;Alyeska gets approval to open leaky pipeline;;Alyeska Pipeline Service Company has received regulatory approval to briefly open its leaky Alaskan pipeline, the closure of which has halted most of the production from North America’s largest crude oilfield.The operator of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which carries oil 800 miles from Prudhoe Bay to the warm-water port of Valdez for shipping to market, said there were “technical risks” with the prolonged shutdown of the pipeline in cold weather.However, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System will be shut again for 36 hours this weekend to install a bypass after the line was temporarily restarted on Wednesday following a leak, according to Bloomberg.The temperature was 10°F (-12°C) on Tuesday at Pump Station 1, where Alyeska on Saturday reported the discovery of an oil leak in a basement from a pipe encased in cement.“The restart will help increase temperatures in tanks and the pipeline, reducing the potential for wax in the oil to accumulate, or for water in the oil to freeze,” Alyeska said in a statement.If such wax or ice were to cause damage, the pipeline could be shut for longer.The leak appears small and has resulted in only about 29 barrels of spilt oil. But the closure of the pipeline has meant the loss of up to 15 per cent of US crude supplies.Analysts say a prolonged closure would put tend to push oil prices higher. US crude futures rose $1.86 to $91.11 a barrel on Tuesday, while European Brent crude rose $1.91 to $97.61 a barrel.Alyeska is jointly owned by BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Koch Alaska Pipeline Company.The consortium is building a bypass to speed up the process of restarting the line, anticipating it would take longer to excavate, repair and gain regulatory approval to reopen the leaky segment.The pipeline system carried an average of 642,261 barrels a day in December. Much of the oil carried is from Prudhoe Bay, North America’s biggest oilfield, which has been ordered to halt 95 per cent of production.The marine terminal at Valdez has 18 storage tanks that hold more than 9m barrels, but only 14 are in operation.Alyeska said the tanks held 35 per cent of their inventory on Sunday, or about 2.5m barrels of oil.Paul Tossetti, senior energy adviser at PFC Energy, a consultancy, said Alaska supplied US west coast refineries, which processed about 2.3m barrels a day. The loss of about 600,000 barrels a day of supply from Alaska represented a loss in input of about a quarter.“A 25 per cent hit is not insignificant,” Mr Tossetti said. “But it can be worked around.”The inventory held at Valdez alone could cover about four days’ supply, he said, adding that the refineries had substantial stock on hand to cover a short-term outage.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
317;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Oil markets on alert over BP leak;;"Oil markets were braced on Monday for the impact of the loss of up to 15 per cent of US crude after a pipeline leak forced BP, the UK-based oil company, to shut down 95 per cent of production from North America’s biggest field.The development, at the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System that carries oil from the Prudhoe Bay field, comes as BP is still grappling with the fallout from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A prolonged shutdown would cut into BP’s output and could undermine earnings.BP owns 46.93 per cent of Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, a consortium that owns the pipeline. ConocoPhillips owns 28.29 per cent; ExxonMobil 20.34 per cent; Chevron 1.36 per cent; and Koch Alaska Pipeline Company 3.08 per cent.Prudhoe Bay is jointly owned by BP, with 26 per cent; ConocoPhillips, with 36 per cent; ExxonMobil, with 36 per cent; and others with 2 per cent. BP is the operator of the field.The leak is in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which carries 14-15 per cent of US crude oil production 800 miles to Valdez, where it is shipped out in tankers. It is the only line carrying oil to market from Prudhoe Bay.The oil market is better supplied than in 2006, when BP was last forced to significantly reduce production amid the discovery of pipeline corrosion at Prudhoe Bay. At that time, oil prices jumped.The cause of the leak is being investigated by state and federal regulators, as well as the company itself, but if it is not fixed within a few days, the incident could put upward pressure on oil prices once more.US-traded oil was up 1 per cent to $88.94 a barrel in Monday trading.BP said it was working to shut down production, taking precautions to prevent the lines from freezing.Alyeska, which is also the pipeline’s operator, said the leaked oil was discovered in the basement of a pump room. It said the leak was in piping encased in concrete and had to be excavated before it could be repaired.The company added that it was considering a variety of options to restart the line as quickly as possible, including bypassing that section of piping.A person involved in the situation said that the leak had not spilt out on to the tundra and would probably be fixed within the week.The pipeline carried an average of 642,261 barrels per day in December, higher than the monthly average last year of 620,000 barrels.The Marine Terminal at Valdez has 18 storage tanks, with total capacity of more than 9m barrels. But only 14 of those tanks are in operation. On Sunday morning, Alyeska said they still held 35 per cent of their inventory, or about 2.5m barrels of oil. There is no significant storage on site to make up for a prolonged outage.In August 2006, BP had said it would shut the entire field after corrosion data and a leak indicated its pipelines were corroded. That information followed the biggest-ever leak at Prudhoe Bay in March of that year. In the end, it was only forced to shut half the field."
318;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oil and gas assets flood on to market;;More than $90bn of global oil and gas assets are on the market as deal activity in the sector accelerates, according to industry estimates.Driven the big oil groups’ attempts to offload non-core assets, the sell-off has gathered pace sharply over the past two years, according to Derrick Petroleum Services, the industry research and consulting firm.The value of industry assets that were on the market in the middle of 2009 was just $20bn and at the start of 2010, it was $46bn.The $90bn-plus figure is all the more significant as it comes after a flurry of deal announcements in the past three months of this year, including significant asset sales by BP, the UK oil group.The figure is “the highest I have seen for at least 10 years,” said one industry executive. The $90bn figure compares with an industry average of between $30bn and $40bn of assets for sale over the past three years, he said.The jump in activity comes as international oil companies including BP, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips have put substantial packages of assets on the block. The majority of sales reflect the groups’ plans to shed non-core assets so as to raise funds to help pay for significant exploration and production ­programmes.The world’s majors are under intense pressure to boost returns for investors. In recent years returns have come disproportionately from dividends and share buy-backs rather than from capital growth, prompting some industry watchers to compare the companies to utilities.BP has led the way with plans to sell up to $30bn of assets to help pay for the Gulf of Mexico spill although it has already sold close to $22bn. Shell is selling some of its Nigerian assets while both BP and ExxonMobil have put some of their assets in the North Sea up for sale. Some substantial gas assets are also up for sale in Canada.Industry executives said in spite of the levels of assets on the block, the market has been clearing as there is still “more money than assets”, according to one executive.A relatively stable oil price, between $70 and $85 per barrel, throughout the year has underpinned strong balance sheets.The Chinese national oil companies have been the most aggressive buyers, notably in Latin America.
319;COP;Conocophillips;2010-12-17T07:08:24Z;Santos secures 20-year LNG deal to supply Korea;;Santos, the Australian energy group, expects to launch its $16bn Gladstone liquefied natural gas project next month after striking a 20-year gas supply deal with Korea Gas, the world’s largest LNG buyer.The Santos-operated project is one of four being developed in the Australian state of Queensland, where coal-bed methane reserves are to be piped hundreds of miles to the port city of Gladstone, converted into LNG, and then shipped to Asia’s energy markets.Santos also sold a 7.5 per cent equity stake in Gladstone LNG to Korea Gas and a further 7.5 per cent to France’s Total for an aggregate A$665m. The Australian group added it had raised $500m from a share placement as it builds cash reserves to fund its shares of the project’s heavy up front costs.Long-term supply agreements from Asian customers are also crucial for the project’s viability.The UK’s BG Group, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips of the US and PetroChina – some in combination with Australian partners – are already big investors in Australia’s coal-bed methane industry.State-run Korea Gas will end up with a 15 per cent stake in the project after also agreeing to buy a 7.5 per cent interest from Malaysia’s Petronas. On completion, Santos will end up owning 30 per cent of Gladstone LNG, with Petronas and Total each owning 27.5 per cent.The Korean government said the deal will help diversify its supplies, away from the Middle East and south-east Asia. It should also help protect the country from higher oil prices.Korea Gas has agreed to buy 3.5m tonnes of Gladstone LNG each year for 20 years from 2015. Petronas will buy the same amount, lifting binding total supply agreements to 7m tonnes per annum, which Santos has valued at more than $120bn.Korea imports 500,000 tonnes of LNG a year from Australia while 80 per cent of its total LNG imports come from four nations: Qatar, Malaysia, Oman and Indonesia.The Korean government said the Gladstone deal would boost the country’s LNG self-sufficiency ratio by around 3 per cent.State-run energy companies in South Korea have stepped up their search for overseas resources through big acquisitions to reduce the country’s dependence on imported oil amid growing concerns about the stability of its supplies. The country is the world’s fifth-largest oil importer, importing almost all of its energy needs.Earlier this year, Korea National Oil Corp acquired a majority stake in Dana Petroleum through a £1.87bn hostile takeover after buying Canada’s Harvest Energy for C$1.8bn.Kepco, South Korea’s state utility, is also actively investing in overseas mines.
320;COP;Conocophillips;2010-11-23T00:17:17Z;Oil spill clean-up response criticised;;The presidential commission investigating the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has said that neither the industry nor the US government had made adequate investments in clean-up technology in the wake of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill.Of the five oil majors, two companies – ConocoPhillips and Chevron – told investigators they had not allocated any money to developing clean-up technology internally, while BP had not clearly indicated whether it had or not. ExxonMobil said it had spent $3m annually and Shell said it had spent $5m per year, but investigators said both figures included spending on outside trade associations that were not prepared to handle a spill on the scale of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.“Based on the minimal information, we believe it is fair to assume that industry spending on in-house response R&D has been, and is currently, minimal at best,” a draft report found.The report also said it disagreed with industry representatives who argued that research dollars could more efficiently be spent on prevention rather than response technology. One executive told the panel that “response is only a 3-5 per cent solution”.But the report said the technology that was used in the five-month effort to kill the Macondo well was essentially no different from that used in the aftermath of the Exxon spill.“We simply do not know what kind of spill response solutions could result from a sizeable commitment by industry and government to response R&D,” it found.The US government also lacked dedication to research, the report said. The four agencies that receive the vast majority of research funding have spent about $10m per year since 1992.The investigation found that federal regulations and market forces had “disincentivised” oil companies from improving spill response technology.One way to tackle the problem would be to revise the offshore drilling insurance regime and increase liabilities for oil companies. It also proposed a tax credit that would only apply to spill clean-up research.A second report released on Monday noted that – according to a senior government official – BP viewed other oil companies with suspicion when asked to advise the government on the best way forward, while calls organised by Washington were “fairly disorganised”.
321;COP;Conocophillips;2010-11-19T17:53:11Z;Kazakhstan accuses Eni of $110m fraud;;Kazakhstan accused Eni, the Italian energy group, of a $110m fraud on Friday, adding to pressure on international oil companies developing its vast oil resources.Adil Abylkasymov, the head of information at Kazakhstan’s financial police, said Eni was under investigation for over representing the construction cost of an oil installation while operator of a foreign group developing the giant Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea.As a result, Eni had “avoided taxation and stolen state property”, he told an oil conference in Astana, Reuters reported.Eni revealed that the Kazakh authorities had opened the investigation in 2007 in its latest annual report, but provided no additional details.Eni has previously denied any wrongdoing.Kazakhstan is trying to wrest better terms from foreign investors that negotiated favorable oil contracts in the 1990’s when oil prices were low.Cost overruns were at the centre of a bitter dispute between the Kazakh government and foreign oil majors at Kashagan in 2008, which ended when KazMunaigas, Kazakhstan’s state oil company, doubled its stake in the project. Eni agreed at the time to share operatorship at the field with its partners at the field which include ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Total and Inpex.Eni is also a partner in a foreign group at Kazakhstan’s Karachaganak oilfield where KazMunaigas is seeking a stake.Kazakhstan plans to enter the ranks of the world’s top ten oil exporters in the coming decade as production triples at its mainly foreign operated fields.
322;COP;Conocophillips;2010-10-31T19:45:55Z;BG Group confirms liquid gas project;;BG Group is to go ahead with a $15bn (£9.3bn) liquefied natural gas project in Queensland, Australia – the UK oil and gas company’s biggest investment.The 8.5m-tonne annual capacity of the planned Curtis Island plant, equivalent to 10 per cent of UK gas demand, will be sold mostly to China and other Asian customers when exports start in 2014, under existing purchase agreements. The plant will be the world’s first to produce LNG from coal-bed methane, a type of natural gas taken from coal seams, according to BG.Australia has some of the world’s largest reserves of coal-bed methane and a relatively small domestic market. Its location makes it an ideal place to export to the LNG markets of Asia, notably China. Aside from BG, other global groups, including Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips of the US and PetroChina – some with Australian partners – are already big investors in Australia’s coal-bed methane industry.Big investment by Gulf states in new LNG production units have created the world’s first global gas markets with cargos from the Middle East able to supply markets in Europe or Asia. Peter Voser, chief executive of Shell, said in a speech last month that LNG supplies could meet a fifth of global gas needs by 2020.Frank Chapman, BG’s chief executive, said on Sunday: “[Our] decision represents the realisation of a pivotal strategic objective – to further the globalisation of our LNG business by establishing a new and material source . . . in the Asia-Pacific arena. [It] is also a significant milestone on the road to delivery of the group’s growth agenda.”The surge in production of LNG has, however, coincided with the rise of shale gas in North America, creating fears of a gas glut or, at least, lower than expected prices for the foreseeable future. A lot of the LNG supplies that were initially destined for the US have now been freed for other markets.BG, which reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, expects to create 5,000 jobs locally in construction and 1,000 permanent posts through its Queensland Curtis LNG project. It is also expected to boost Australia’s exports by about A$4bn (£2.5bn) a year as well as adding 11 per cent to foreign direct investment. It will involve the construction of a 540km pipeline to move gas from the Queensland interior, where the gas will be drilled using 6,000 bore holes, and a so-called “two-train” liquefaction plant on Curtis Island, near the port of Gladstone.BG has an agreement to sell 3.6m tonnes of LNG a year to China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and a proposed agreement with Tokyo Gas for 1.2m tonnes a year. Both companies will also become small equity investors in the project.Competitors, including Santos, the Australian energy group, are set to commit to similar projects.BG shares, which risen more than 11 per cent in the last year, rose 1.5p on Monday to £12.17.
323;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Conoco more than doubles quarterly earnings;Asset sales more than make up for declining oil production;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, reported a doubling of third-quarter earnings to $3.1bn as it ramped up asset sales as part of a restructuring. Revenue reached $50bn, up from $41bn in the same period last year.Conoco generated $6bn from the sale of Lukoil shares.Excluding gains from asset sales and other items, third-quarter adjusted earnings were $2.2bn, or $1.50 a share, up 47 per cent from the same period last year.Conoco’s production was lower in the third quarter, at 1.72m barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 1.79m in the same period in 2009.This drop was primarily a result of maturing fields, mostly in North America and Europe, as well as asset sales.The company managed to offset some of those declines with increased production from China, Australia, US shale plays and Canadian oil sands.It scaled back North America natural gas production late in the quarter, by about 180m cubic feet equivalent per day, because of low natural gas prices.Jim Mulva, chief executive, said he expected production declines to be offset by major offshore projects in south-east Asia, liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar and Australia, Canadian oil sands projects and US shale developments.Conoco has increasingly been focusing on shale, the tight rock from which the industry has recently found an economic way to extract both natural gas and oil. It is active in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and north Barnett shale plays, and plans to accelerate its drilling activity in those areas during the fourth quarter.In addition, the company has just completed a second well in Poland, testing a possible shale gas field, and is conducting additional tests on the first well drilled this year.During the third quarter, Conoco generated $10.6bn in cash – $4.3bn from operations and $6.3bn from asset sales. This was used to pay $2.7bn of debt, fund a $2.5bn capital programme, repurchase $900m of Conoco stock and pay $0.8bn in dividends.Conoco ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8bn, much of which will be used for share repurchases. As of September 30, debt was $23.6bn.
324;COP;Conocophillips;2010-10-25T16:07:23Z;BP to sell four Gulf of Mexico fields;;"BP has agreed to sell its interests in four deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico to Japan’s Marubeni Oil for $650m (£414m).The assets, which BP said produce 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day (boe/d), were purchased from the Oklahoma-based US company Devon Energy in March in a £7bn all-cash deal that included assets in Azerbaijan and Brazil.BP has been looking to reduce the number of operatorships it holds in the Gulf of Mexico as part of a move to cut its capital spending and rebalance its portfolio of assets in the wake of the Macondo oil spill disaster.BP said the spill affected only the timing of the disposal: “It’s about keeping the things that have big potential for growth and selling off those that don’t. We would have disposed of them at some point; the decision to get rid of them is nothing to do with Macondo although the timing has been accelerated.”The principal assets sold are mature fields in the western and central Gulf of Mexico. They include interests in the ConocoPhillips-operated Magnolia field, the Anadarko Petroleum operated Merganser and Nansen fields and an operating interest in the Zia field.BP shares rose 0.45p to 429.15p on Monday.Gordon Gray, an analyst at Collins Stewart, said: “The point is that BP did a deal with Devon pre-Macondo, which included a bundle of Gulf of Mexico assets. Some of them were not a logical strategic fit so it makes commercial sense to sell. This would have happened anyway – it doesn’t presage a wider sell-off in the Gulf of Mexico.”The Devon deal was primarily done to acquire eight licence blocks in offshore Brazil, whose deep water fields are estimated to hold at least 80bn barrels of oil, as well as deep water assets in the Gulf of Mexico that BP will retain.Andy Hopwood, BP executive vice-president, said: “When BP acquired Devon’s Gulf of Mexico assets it was clear that these four fields did not fit well with the rest of our business in the region.”The UK oil group produces from more than 20 deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico and is the biggest operator in the region, with net production of 400,000 boe/d, according to the company. Until the Macondo oil spill disaster on April 20, the US was BP’s principal strategic focus but the company now faces a challenge to restore its reputation."
325;COP;Conocophillips;2010-10-13T22:19:40Z;LyondellBasell listing marks comeback from bankruptcy;Chemical manufacturer set for NYSE appearance;LyondellBasell, the world’s third-biggest chemical manufacturer, is listing on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, marking the culmination of its journey back from bankruptcy.In getting the company this far, Jim Gallogly, chief executive, has cut $1bn in costs, reduced the workforce by 3,000 and realised the synergies from Lyondell’s merger with Basell in December 2007 – something previous management had failed to do.“The company’s headcount went up until the day of bankruptcy,” Mr Gallogly told the Financial Times. “It was operated as two separate companies. The efficiencies were not gained.”The Rotterdam-based company had $24bn in debt from mergers and acquisitions, and yet the previous management was intent upon growing further, he said, pointing to continued asset acquisitions. “Everybody likes to talk about growth,’’ Mr Gallogly said.The company’s weaknesses were exacerbated by the volatility in commodity prices, the global debt crisis and the economic downturn, and LyondellBasell filed for bankruptcy in January 2009.LyondellBasell is the world’s largest producer of polypropylene and polypropylene compounds and a top global producer of ethylene, propylene and poly-ethylene.Mr Gallogly was brought in to lead the company in May 2009 from his position as head of exploration and production at ConocoPhillips, the US’s third-biggest oil company. He set a goal of pulling LyondellBasell out of bankruptcy within a year and only just met that goal on April 30.“Generally I work every waking hour,” Mr Gallogly said. “I thought I used to work hard, but I realised I had another gear.”Mr Gallogly, with 29 years experience running big assets, immediately set benchmarks for his various chemical and refining facilities. He managed to focus staff on obtaining the same cost structure, performance, emission levels, efficiencies and headcount as comparable sites.Filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors meant LyondellBasell was able to reduce debt and costs dramatically.As part of its reorganisation, it converted $18bn of debt into equity. That had resulted in the elimination of $1.7bn per year in interest payments, which, on top of $1bn per year in fixed costs savings, meant $2.7bn was no longer going out the door each year, Mr Gallogly said.He is seeking further savings by spending $1bn over the next five years to improve energy efficiency across its 59 manufacturing sites in 18 countries.With 75 per cent of the cost of its products tied to energy, reducing energy costs was key, he said.The revival of the company, which has 23 manufacturing sites in North America, has been helped by the US natural gas boom.This has created a glut, pushing down domestic prices to about $4 per million British thermal units (mBtu) this year.That was down from a record high of $13.69 per mBtu in July 2008 and had made the US the second-lowest cost chemical producer after the Middle East, he said.The company will explore selling non-core assets after the market improves. He noted creditors had agreed with him to wait until the assets could obtain proper value instead of pushing him to sell during bankruptcy like many companies. “There will come a time when we’ll sell bits and pieces of our portfolio,” he said.He will stay away from acquisitions for now, saying 85 per cent of the company’s capital spending would be directed into maintenance and energy efficiency improvements.On August 16, LyondellBasell reported that earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortisation and restructuring costs were $2.04bn for the first six months of 2010.Ebitdar for 2009 was $2.26bn, meaning the company was almost matching performance for all of last year within the first six months of this one.“It’s one of those comeback stories, but it’s just the start of it,” Mr Gallogly said.
326;COP;Conocophillips;2010-10-07T20:29:11Z;JPMorgan buys RBS Sempra Commodities’ trading book;;JPMorgan Chase is set to become one of North America’s largest natural gas traders with the purchase of RBS Sempra Commodities’ trading book.The US bank has agreed to pay about $220m to take over North American gas and power deals from the joint venture partly owned by Royal Bank of Scotland. The UK bank was ordered to divest its stake by the European Commission in return for state bail-out funding.JPMorgan in July bought RBS Sempra’s global oil, metals, coal and European power and gas business for $1.6bn, aggressively raising its commodities profile against entrenched Wall Street rivals.But the bank initially balked at the North American assets because they overlapped with an existing power and gas group added in JPMorgan’s 2008 takeover of investment bank Bear Stearns. Uncertainty over US financial reforms, since passed, also weighed against a wider deal.JPMorgan is now buying a trading book with a gross value of $6bn as of June 30, according to RBS. The portfolio includes physical and financial gas and power transactions and access to pipelines and gas storage facilities. The roughly 750 counterparties to the trades include gas producers, power plants, utilities and governments. In the second quarter, RBS Sempra ranked the fifth-largest North American gas marketer by volume, after BP, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and Macquarie, according to Platts. JPMorgan was 12th.The sale announced on Thursday “will complete the divestiture of the last of the principal assets” of RBS Sempra, RBS’s joint venture partner, Sempra Energy, said. But JPMorgan is not hiring the 300 people who remain at RBS Sempra, down from 1,100 when the entire unit first went up for sale. RBS said it still is considering “various alternatives for the modest level of residual assets and liabilities of the business.”Last month, Hong Kong-based commodity trader Noble Group agreed to buy RBS Sempra’s retail energy unit for $317m, plus assumption of $265m in debt.US energy regulators must approve the deal, which sellers expect to happen by year end.
327;COP;Conocophillips;2010-09-28T02:05:53Z;Conoco to reassess $30bn Alaska project;;Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said the company would reassess the economics of its project with BP to build a $30bn pipeline linking Alaska to the lower 48 US states amid a surge in natural gas supplies.Technological breakthroughs in extracting gas from shale rock have enabled the US to triple supply estimates, much of it in the lower 48 states, to 100 years’ supply, at current usage rates.This, in turn, has led to a glut, pushing gas prices down to about $4 per million British thermal units, from the $13.69 per mBtu record reached in 2008.This “creates more competitive concerns for Alaska natural gas’’, Mr Mulva told the Financial Times in an interview.The 3,200-mile-long pipeline, which it bills as the largest private construction project in North American history, is in the “open season” stage, where companies solicit bids to secure customer commitments.Conoco and BP are focusing on the first stage of the project, the 1,700-mile stretch from Alaska to Alberta. The second phase, a 1,500-mile pipeline from Alberta to Chicago, would be considered at a later date.Following the open season, which ends on October 4, Mr Mulva said the partners would have to decide how to proceed with the project to bring Alaska’s 35,000bn cubic feet of proven natural gas and natural gas liquids to the rest of the US.The decision will be based on the fiscal certainties provided by Alaska and how competitive the gas will be against that being produced in the lower 48 states through shale and other unconventional extraction methods.Gas is now so plentiful – and cheap – that Conoco has shut some production in both the US and Canada, noting that current prices are below replacement costs, so they are not sustainable. “We’d rather keep it in the ground for when it will have a greater financial impact,” he said.“According to MIT, 60 per cent of US shale gas can be developed for under $6 per thousand cubic feet. That’s often less than conventional gas,’’ Mr Mulva said.He noted long-term forecasts in the $6-$7 range. Accessing Alaska’s conventional gas reserves through traditional drilling methods is easier and cheaper than unconventional means.But there will be additional costs imposed upon buyers to import it from Alaska. In addition, the project by Conoco and BP is not the only one in the works. ExxonMobil and TransCanada are working on a similar project. Their open season ended on July 30, and those companies are assessing their bids.
328;COP;Conocophillips;2010-09-27T08:35:17Z;TPG;Minority stakes in strategic Russian companies are fraught with risk;Guards took over the St Petersburg headquarters, riot police stood by and 20 people were arrested. Far from a revolutionary rally in 1917, it was the scene last week at Lenta, the Russian hypermarket and portfolio company of TPG, the US private equity group. Its $100m investment with joint venture partner VTB, Russia’s second-largest bank, gives new meaning to the phrase corporate infighting.The kerfuffle – a reminder that emerging markets offer a high return for a reason – started when Jan Dunning, Lenta’s chief executive, was locked out of his office after a rival investor in Lenta attempted to install Sergei Yushchenko as a replacement. Mr Yushchenko, incidentally, was also chief executive of a competitor and was previously fired from the top spot at Lenta. TPG’s investment in the country is not even one year old. Welcome to Russia.Having been bitten once, San Francisco-based TPG looks brave to consider a $3.1bn splurge on one-tenth of VTB itself. Minority stakes in strategic Russian companies are fraught with risk for outsiders. Just ask ConocoPhillips, the US oil group, which will now ditch its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil after five years. Then there is political risk. The Russian government holds 85 per cent of the bank, raising the spectre of authoritarian leadership.But if TPG wants to expand in Russia, it is better off investing with the Kremlin than against it. For public consumption, at least, Moscow voices its acceptance of foreigners owning stakes in its financial institutions. A deal would mostly be about access to Russian investment opportunities, financing and contacts, rather than realising a return from VTB itself – which is just as well, as it went into the red last year thanks to bad loans. Ultimately TPG’s potential gamble reflects a sensible assessment of risks.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
329;COP;Conocophillips;2010-09-17T17:09:43Z;Centrica boosts North Sea interests;;Centrica, the owner of British Gas, is to continue its expansion in the North Sea in a £144m acquisition that will boost its oil and gas reserves by 29m barrels of oil equivalent (boe).The deal, which will see Centrica almost double its stake in the Norwegian Stratfjord field from 9.7 per cent to 19.1 per cent, comes after last year’s £1.3bn acquisition of Venture Production, another North Sea producer.The North Sea – once assumed by many in the oil and gas industry to be in terminal decline – is at the centre of Centrica’s plans to ensure that at least half of the energy it sells comes from its own production and to reduce exposure to volatile spot gas prices.Paul de Leeuw, Centrica’s head of upstream operations, said the company believed that the North Sea held 25bn boe and still represented “a prize” for Centrica.“Spot prices are a difficult one [for us] because gas is bought years in advance so this deal is consistent with our aim of securing oil and gas for the UK,” said Mr de Leeuw.The news is the latest in a raft of Centrica acquisition deals over the past year and it comes a month after Centrica struck a £229m deal to acquire 97 natural gas wells from Suncor in western Canada.In February, Centrica paid $380m (£243m) to purchase Suncor’s gas assets in Trinidad.“Over the past year we’ve been active, so this is very much in line with what we’ve been doing, acquiring resources on our doorstep and also further afield,” said Mr de Leeuw.Shares in Centrica rose 2.1p to 343.1p on Friday.Under the terms of the deal, Centrica will acquire Norske Shell and Enterprise Oil’s gas-and-oil-producing assets in the Norwegian North Sea for NKr1.37bn (£144m).The field will require an additional £100m in development costs over the next three years and will give Centrica 172bn cubic feet equivalent (cfe) of gas and oil reserves, as well as 70m cubic feet per day of natural gas and oil production. This equates to a 6 per cent increase in Centrica’s total reserves.Peter Hitchens, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said: “The utility companies are all trying to source gas because of declining reserves in the UK and more expensive imports.“For Centrica the deal is about security of supply – it doesn’t want to be dependent on a gas pipeline from, say, Russia.”The field is operated exclusively by Statoil, Norway’s largest oil company. ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Centrica are all licence partners in the field, holding a financial stake, but not operating any rigs.As part of the deal, Centrica will also acquire smaller stakes in three other fields.In July, Centrica reported first-half pre-tax profits of £2bn thanks to lower wholesale gas prices.
330;COP;Conocophillips;2010-09-13T21:17:21Z;US financials boosted by new bank rules;;"US stocks rose to the highest level for a month as financial stocks were boosted by a global agreement on capital requirements, and the industrial sector benefited from
better than expected economic data from China.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent at 1,121.90, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,544.13 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.89 per cent higher at 2,285.71.The S&P 500 broke through its 200-day moving average and all 10 main S&P sectors rose, five by one per cent. Global regulators agreed to phase in rules for lenders to comply with their new, more stringent, capital reserves rules from January 2013 to January 2019. Todd Hagerman at Collins Stewart said on average large US banks have 8.79 per cent tier one capital, which is more than the 7 per cent equity component that Basel III will require.Keith Horowitz, an
analyst at Citigroup, added that the best capitalised of the large caps were likely to begin to return capital through dividends and
buy-backs, and he cited JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and US Bancorp as possible examples. The S&P 500 financial index led the risers, up 2.3 per cent, after the Basel III committee unveiled the new rules.Goldman Sachs added 2.7 per cent to $154.37, JPMorgan Chase climbed 3.7 per cent to $41.24 and US Bancorp was up 3.3 per cent to $23.37. Bank of America rose 3 per cent to $13.95 and Citigroup rose 2.1 per cent to $3.99. Among regional banks, Marshall & Ilsley rose 4.5 per cent to $7.27 and Zions Bancorporation added 7.4 per cent to $21.31.Chinese data on industrial production and retail sales showed that the economy seemed to be stabilising. Industrial stocks, many of which make a large proportion of their revenue in the region, rose with General Electric up 1.7 per cent to $16.25, Caterpillar up 1.4 per cent to $72.24 and Honeywell up 1.1 per cent to $43.30. The broader industrials sector rose 1.1 per cent.Oil companies benefited from oil prices reaching a four-week high, partly due to the continuing closure of the largest oil pipeline from Canada to the Midwest of the US after a leak, and partly on the back of the Chinese economic data.ConocoPhillips rose 1.2 per cent to $55.38 and Suncor Energy was higher by 1.1 per cent to $33.26. ExxonMobil fell 0.3 per cent to $61.00 after its rating was cut from “buy” to “hold” by Deutsche Bank because of its exposure to natural gas, of which there is a surplus across the world.Xerox, the photocopy machine and document-management company, rose 7.7 per cent to $9.81 after it was reported that the share price could double as it enters the more profitable data processing, analysis and storage market."
331;COP;Conocophillips;2010-09-09T10:01:34Z;Total makes A$870m bet on Australian gas;;Total of France has become the latest big oil group to place a bet on Australia’s unconventional gas sector with an agreement to buy a 20 per cent stake in Australia’s Gladstone LNG project for almost A$870m ($805m).It marks Total’s first big investment in the coal bed methane industry and comes as a handful of competing projects in the Australian state of Queensland race to sign up Asian energy customers before finally committing an estimated A$50bn ($46.2bn) to develop the gas reserves.UK’s BG Group, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips of the US and PetroChina – some in combination with Australian partners – are already big investors in Australia’s coal-bed methane industry.The French group is buying a 15 per cent stake in the Gladstone LNG project from Santos, the Adelaide-based oil and gas group, and a further 5 per cent from Petronas, Malaysia’s state oil company.The sale leaves Santos with a 45 per cent share and Petronas with 35 per cent. However, Santos is understood to be in talks with Korea Gas Corp, one of the world’s top LNG buyers, about the sale of a further equity stake in Gladstone LNG as well as an “off-take” LNG sales agreement.Santos shares fell 7 per cent to close down 96 cents at A$12.79, reflecting concerns that the A$650m sale price for the 15 per cent stake was lower than expected. Investors fear that Santos may need to undertake a possible equity capital raising of A$2bn to fund its ongoing commitment to Gladstone LNG’s development.Xavier Grunauer, an analyst at Nomura, had estimated a 15 per cent stake in Gladstone LNG was worth closer to $1.5bn. He also said Total was buying in at a discount when compared with the $2bn paid by Petronas for its 40 per cent stake in 2008.“Santos wanted to raise cash and Total has negotiated a very good price, and being Total they have a lot of pull,” he said.Mr Grunauer added Total’s investment was a “good sign” for the sector. The energy industry was hobbled by uncertainty earlier this year over Canberra’s plans to hit the mining and onshore energy industries with a “super profits” tax.Australia’s recently re-elected Labor government was forced to cave in to the relentless pressure from the mining companies. It has promised to fold the coal-bed methane industry into the petroleum resource rent tax, an existing regime that already applies to the offshore energy industry.Although some implementation details are yet to be finalised for the tax to be applied to the coal-bed methane industry, executives generally welcomed the government’s decision.Santos said its off-take agreements with Petronas, which will take 3.5m tonnes of LNG per year, and Total, which has agreed to take 1.5m tonnes, were worth an estimated A$100bn over 20 years.Those sales agreements will underpin the development of a two-train LNG processing project, Santos said. The Australian group hopes to reach a financial investment decision on the project in less than four months.
332;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;CFTC discusses derivatives rules with Wall St;;A US regulator is calling on Wall Street firms’ expertise as it seeks to write rules to monitor the same firms’ derivatives dealings for the first time.Dozens of banks and industrial groups, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, BP and Cargill, have discussed revamping derivatives with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the six weeks since the US financial reform law passed, in some cases at the agency’s request.Gary Gensler, commission chairman, was a fierce critic of banks that resisted reform of the unregulated derivatives marketplace. The CFTC is set to draft rules over the next year to meet the law’s mandates, including regulations for derivatives dealers for the first time.The CFTC, founded in 1974, is new to the $615,000bn over-the-counter derivatives market it will now police along with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CFTC records indicate staff have sought guidance from derivatives market participants, even as some lobby the agency.Goldman, a leading derivatives dealer, has participated in four discussions with the CFTC since August 19, covering such issues as business conduct and “the use of data fields needed for the reporting of swaps,” according to the records. “At the staff’s request,” Goldman employees also answered questions about agricultural derivatives, records show.JPMorgan has joined three discussions with CFTC, addressing issues such as the “definition and operation of swap execution facilities.” At an August 16 meeting, Merrill Lynch touched on “the burdens associated with local compliance requirements of financial entities that provide risk management services on a global basis,” as well the Volcker rule, which bans proprietary trading by banks, and limits on traders’ positions in commodity derivatives.Buy-side investment groups, including hedge funds Brevan Howard and DE Shaw and BlackRock, the asset manager, have also participated in discussions.Some participants have pressed their own positions. A group of energy companies that included BP, ConocoPhillips and Vitol objected to the prospect that the CFTC will regulate commercial energy companies as “swap dealers.”“Though commonly not viewed as ‘dealers,’ many commercial energy firms and end-users engage in a significant volume of ‘swap’ transactions. Often, these trading activities are a significant part of the business of a commercial energy firm. Such firms are better characterized as ‘traders,’” the group said in its proposed August 25 agenda.Participants in other discussions included leading derivatives exchanges, labour union representatives and Michael Masters, a hedge fund manager who has argued that investors such as pension funds helped fuel a rise in energy and food prices.
333;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
334;COP;Conocophillips;2010-09-02T22:47:35Z;Statoil paves way for IPO of filling stations;;Statoil on Thursday signalled it was pushing ahead with the planned spin-off of its international chain of filling stations as the Norwegian energy group sought to sharpen its focus on oil and gas exploration.The group said it had applied to the Oslo Stock Exchange for the admission of a new company, Statoil Fuel & Retail, paving the way for an initial public offering in the fourth quarter of this year.Analysts said the business could be valued at more than NKr10bn ($1.6bn). The fuel and retail business made operating profits of NKr1.5bn in 2009.The spin-off would underline the shift by oil and gas producers away from roadside retail operations, typically among the lowest margin parts of their business.In the past decade, Conoco­Phillips has shed 55.4 per cent of its retail sites, ExxonMobil 38.5 per cent and Royal Dutch Shell 29.8 per cent, according to PFC Energy, the consultancy.BP has sold all its US filling stations since 2007 and Chevron launched a restructuring of its retail operations earlier this year.The Statoil business includes 2,300 filling stations in eight countries across Scandinavia, the Baltic states, Poland and Russia. It also includes a unit that sells lubricants and aviation and marine fuels.Statoil on Thursday said it would hold on to at least half of the company after the IPO, which would go ahead in the fourth quarter, subject to market conditions.The group, two-thirds owned by the Norwegian government, announced the spin-off plan last February.Analysts welcomed the move at the time, saying it was hard for Statoil to justify investment in a business with a much lower return on investment than its core production operations.The group is increasingly focused on exploration in the Americas, Africa and the Middle East to offset the decline in its mature North Sea reserves.While representing just a small fraction of Statoil’s revenues, the retail business would be among the larger companies listed on the Oslo bourse.Statoil holds the number one or two positions in most of the retail markets in which it operates.“In the future, we believe that this unit’s growth and further development will be best achieved as an independent company with direct access to the capital markets,” said Helge Lund, Statoil chief executive, in February.The group will keep control of its refinery business, which supplies the retail operation.
335;COP;Conocophillips;2010-08-26T18:17:42Z;Questions hang over future of Big Oil;;Robert Dudley faces a bulging in-tray when he takes over as chief executive of BP in October.The oil company’s reputation in the US needs repairing in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico spill. The cause of the disaster is still being investigated and legal battles loom.An even bigger challenge, however, will be to determine what BP looks like in the future.The crisis that has engulfed the company since the accident in April has brought into sharp relief a question that has worried the world’s integrated oil majors for some time – is Big Oil still delivering? The answer for many energy commentators and shareholders is ‘no’.“Big Oil is a busted model as long as the market demands short-term, high-value growth,” said one long-term industry adviser.Driving the debate is not just BP’s predicament but the uninspiring returns the so-called supermajors have delivered over the past five years.The aim of producing more oil, a key measure, has not always been met. Apart from ConocoPhillips, which did it in part by acquisition, the others failed to deliver meaningful volume growth, said Antonia Bullard, a senior director at PFC Energy, the consultancy. Chevron has come closest with a rise of 13 per cent over that period.Total shareholder returns – share price appreciation plus dividend payments – over the period have also varied. Despite paying out billions of dollars in dividends, BP delivered a negative return due to its poor share price performance, according to PFC’s analysis. Chevron fared better but its share price performance has been unspectacular.“The returns for shareholders have come disproportionately from dividends and share buy-backs rather than from capital growth,” said one industry watcher. “They have become almost like giant utilities.”That analysis is particularly apt if you compare the supermajors with oil companies such as BG that are not integrated – with no “downstream” or refining and marketing operations – and which have delivered strong capital growth, albeit from a smaller base. The supermajors fare even worse when compared with smaller, more nimble-footed competitors such as Cairn Energy.The industry’s long lead times don’t help. “The difficulty for many institutional investors is the timeframes of the oil and gas industry relative to those required for investor returns,” said Jason Kenney, analyst at ING. The average lead time between first discovery and first production is eight to 10 years.This leads to cyclicality. After a period of heavy investment, Royal Dutch Shell, for example, is about to reap the benefits and today has 13 projects due to start producing oil and gas by the end of 2011.Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, points out that critics tend to focus on production numbers, which have been flat, but the yield per barrel has gone up sharply, signalling that Big Oil has become far more efficient.But for Mr Dudley and his peers, the strategic dilemma remains. The industry has often debated whether shedding refining assets is the answer and last year Knight Vinke, the activist investor, urged Italy’s Eni to break itself up.Refining generates cash and allows a company to deliver returns over the course of market cycles, but it is a tough business.In recent years, refiners have been feeling pressure from lower margins amid the global slowdown. Prospects are clouded by potential carbon legislation. Shedding the refining segment could also allow easier link-ups with national oil companies or joint ventures in strategic areas such as Russia.Many executives believe the Gulf of Mexico disaster makes the case for Big Oil. With the costs and risks of exploring set to rise as regulation gets tougher, only the biggest companies capable of hiring the best technical talent will be able to fund these activities.But given its predicament BP needs to look at all options. With the company paying no dividend, some of Mr Dudley’s shareholders are restless.One says an idea that has been debated is whether BP should break itself into its constituent parts. Shareholders could pick either a growth vehicle, focused on exploration, or an income vehicle that would include BP’s production and refining assets.Whether Mr Dudley will opt for something this radical remains to be seen. When he was announced as Tony Hayward’s successor in July, he talked about using asset sales to “reset” BP, “to create more of a growth company”, selling mature, declining oil and gas fields and retaining the more attractive prospects. BP plans to sell $25bn-$30bn (£16bn-£19bn) of assets over the next 18 months.Will it be enough to appease investors? Some are sceptical and one banker argues that BP will need to do something more strategic to deliver higher growth.ING’s Mr Kenney is more positive. BP, he says, “actually has a good chance of being ahead of the game now. It will become a leaner, meaner company.”
336;COP;Conocophillips;2010-08-24T21:24:07Z;Oil groups have little to show from Libya;;BP has a lot riding on its controversial exploration programme off the coast of Libya.The UK oil group, whose reputation is under fire over its Gulf of Mexico oil spill, is preparing to drill a first deep-water well in the Gulf of Sirte in the autumn in what will be one of its biggest-ever exploration commitments, in an offshore area that is the size of Belgium.The company is not alone in targeting the North African country. Most of the world’s oil majors have quietly been tapping into its promise in recent years.ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are all present. The biggest single oil producer is the Waha Oil Company, a joint venture between National Oil Corporation and Conoco-Phillips, Hess and Marathon, according to African Energy, an industry publication.Recent exploration efforts have, however, proved disappointing and have dented the optimism that accompanied the return of international oil companies to Libya after the final lifting of sanctions in 2004.“We are coming up to the end of a five-year period where there has not been a lot of notable exploration success to point to,” said Ross Cassidy, Libya analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the oil consultancy. “Results have been poor when you compare with what was expected and hoped for.”Big oil companies piled into Libya, competing for blocks in four licensing rounds held between 2005 and 2007, lured by the promise of an under-explored country that has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa. So far they have little to show for their huge investments in recent years. Offshore, only Hess reported finding hydrocarbons that can be developed commercially, in its Arous el Bahr well.ExxonMobil has drilled two offshore exploration wells near Libya but with little luck. It has no production in the country and the two wells found no hydrocarbons.“Both wells have provided important technical data about the basins, and we will use the information to plan our remaining evaluation program with the Libyan National Oil Corporation,” ExxonMobil said.Rival Chevron drilled one exploration well in Libya in 2009 on a block acquired during the country’s first exploration licence round in 2005. It, too, did not encounter any hydrocarbons. It relinquished its Block 177 exploration licence in 2009. Chevron said it maintains a representative office in Tripoli and continues to monitor investment opportunities in North Africa, including in Libya.Royal Dutch Shell is assisting in the rejuvenation of a 39-year-old liquefied natural gas plant and exploring for gas onshore. The company is also still working through its drilling commitments in the exploration phase and has so far drilled two wells in the Sirte basin, and has two further wells under way. However, it has so far not announced any discoveries.Eni, the Italian group and the largest foreign operator in North Africa, is not involved in any offshore drilling activity in Libyan waters, but has two offshore fields that have been in production without incident since the 1970s, in waters of less than 200 metres. The company has invested some $50bn in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt in the past 10 years. The area is 35 per cent of Eni’s total production.Companies that still have deep-water drilling plans include Russia’s Gazprom, Petrobras of Brazil and Pertamina of Indonesia.BP plans to drill at least five offshore wells. The company’s operations are under intense scrutiny after the US spill, not least because its first Libyan well is 200 metres deeper than the Macondo well, which ruptured on April 20, killing 11 workers. At the same time, US senators are continuing to investigate links between the company’s lobbying of the UK government for a prisoner-transfer agreement with Libya and the Scottish government’s 2009 release of Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, the Libyan man convicted of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. Nevertheless, industry analysts believe the programmes of BP and Shell are very significant for those companies and for Libya.“This is a fantastically important exploration for Libya,” said John Hamilton, the author of a study on Libya’s energy future for African Energy. “If it works out it will open a whole new future for Libya as a hydrocarbons producer on Europe’s doorstep.”Mr Cassidy added: “It is too early to say that exploration potential in Libya has been downgraded.“Most still believe there is huge potential. The next phase of drilling may live up to expectations.”Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty in Houston and Giulia Segreti in Rome
337;COP;Conocophillips;2010-08-18T20:39:46Z;Wall Street boosted by Target’s outlook;;US stocks nudged up on Wednesday after a positive outlook from Target buoyed retail stocks, outweighing weaker-than-expected sales figures from many retailers.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent at 1,094.16, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 10,415.54 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent higher at 2,215.70.Trading was choppy. “The market is pretty data-dependant right now – it’s been stuck in this trading range for a while as nothing has put the tug of war between the bulls and the bears to bed,” said Wasif Latif, vice-president of equity investments at USAA. “We’re searching for clarity from tomorrow’s data – leading indicators, the Philly Fed index and jobless claims – it’s a pretty busy calendar that will have a pretty big impact.”The S&P 500 retail sector was up 1.7 per cent after Target said that third quarter earnings would match analyst estimates. Its shares rose 2.5 per cent to $51.95 even though the group joined the list of retailers beating expectations on earnings but not on sales.The discount retailer reported earnings per share of 92 cents, in line with analysts’ expectations. The results were boosted by profit from its card unit, which more than doubled to $149m, as well as sales of higher margin products such as clothing.Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 1.7 per cent with revenue coming in at $15.5bn, slightly short of expectations.Chico’s rose after reporting its results, up 10 per cent to $9.25. The clothing retailer’s net income more than doubled to 17 cents a share and beat analysts’ forecast of 16 cents a share.But the chain also suffered from below-expectation sales, coming in at $465.4m compared with estimates of $468.1m.The company also approved a $200m share buy-back, which will be carried out until January 2013.In contrast, BJ’s Wholesale Club, the operator of warehouse stores, fell 2.7 per cent to $42.14 after it lowered its full-year forecast to $2.40-$2.50 per share, compared with the consensus estimate of $2.68.Profit for its second quarter missed analysts’ expectations at 67 cents a share compared with projections of 73 cents a share.Energy stocks fell as the oil prices continued to drop with the S&P 500 energy sector losing 1.1 per cent.ExxonMobil was down 1.1 per cent to $60.15, Conoco Phillips declined 0.8 per cent to $55.42 and Chevron slid 0.9 per cent to $77.04.In other earnings news, the world’s largest maker of farm machinery, Deere & Co, announced better-than-expected results. In the third quarter, profit per share was $1.44 against analyst forecasts of $1.14.Sales also beat expectations, rising 16 per cent to $6.84bn compared with an average projection of $6.52bn as demand rose in the US but was “down sharply” in Europe.Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $65.98 after the company said demand for its products was rebounding but sales were still far below normal level.BHP Billiton, the world’s largest miner, launched a hostile bid for PotashCorp after the fertiliser producer rejected its $130-a-share offer on Tuesday.US-listed shares of BHP Billiton fell 2.9 per cent to $68.18 and PotashCorp, which soared 27.7 per cent on Tuesday, rose 3.3 per cent to $147.93.In other deal news, Windstream, a phone company that provides service to rural areas, agreed to acquire Q-Comm for about $782m. Windstream shares fell 0.8 per cent to $11.40.Life Technologies rose 0.3 per cent to $45.08 after the provider of gene analysis tools for medical research said it had agreed to buy Ion Torrent for $375m in cash and shares. Ion Torrent has made a DNA-sequencing system that translates chemical signals into digital information.BioMarin Pharmaceutical, which makes treatments for rare genetic conditions, was up 0.2 per cent to $20.55 after it bought ZyStor Therapeutics, a biotechnology company, for about $115m.Washington Post advanced 3.3 per cent to $338.40 after its Kaplan education unit signed a five-year contract with Cambridge University Press to collaborate on producing teaching materials.

The Vix index, a measure of market volatility, jumped 13.4 per cent to 25.37, the biggest leap since the end of June.The Fed failed to reassure investors with its pledge to buy longer-dated Treasuries with money from maturing mortgage holdings. After the Fed announcement on Tuesday, stocks pared their losses but did not enter positive territory.“This is looking like a correction from last week’s positive sentiment and expectations that the Fed might do more quantitative easing, which it seems was mere speculation,”
said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.“I’m really looking for some choppy markets for the foreseeable future as we’ve had a bit of a run-up from the end of June and particularly in July. It’s a traders’ market instead of an investors’ market – no one has got a lot of conviction and they’re not holding on to positions.”Markets were shaken further by data released before the bell which showed that the US trade deficit unexpectedly widened 18.8 per cent to $49.9bn in June as imports of consumer goods from China and the rest of the world soared while US exports fell.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell more than 1 per cent, with eight falling more than 2 per cent.Materials and energy stocks, which were hit by the fall in metals and oil prices when China reported a drop in import growth on Tuesday, continued their decline after more negative data from China showed a slowdown in factory output.The S&P 500 Materials sector fell 3.4 per cent, with aluminium producer Alcoa down 6.1 per cent at $10.66, iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources losing 5 per cent to $58.02 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold falling 4.3 per cent to $70.04.The S&P 500 Energy sector was down 2.9 per cent, with oil companies Exxon falling 1.8 per cent to $60.39, Chevron declining 2.4 per cent to $77.13 and Conoco Phillips sliding 2.4 per cent to $55.51.Industrials were the biggest faller, with the S&P 500 Industrial sector down 3.4 per cent. Boeing the aircraft manufacturer, was down 4.4 per cent to $65.60 and Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters, fell 5.7 per cent to $18.97.The S&P 500 Financials sector also suffered, closing down 3.6 per cent, led by insurer Hartford Financial which dropped 7.5 per cent to $20.86. Bank of America was down 3.2 per cent to $13.19 and JP Morgan slid 3.6 per cent to $37.77.But there was some positive earnings news. Macy’s beat analysts’ expectations by tailoring its product offer to local tastes and selling exclusive products. It reported net income of 35 cents per share for the second quarter, up from 2 cents per share for the same quarter last year. Analysts had forecast income of 29 cents per share. The second-biggest US department store chain also raised its earnings and sales forecasts for the year. The shares rose 5.9 per cent to $20.52.However, shares in Walt Disney fell 3 per cent to $34.22 in spite of reporting better-than-expected earnings.The company reported after the closing bell on Tuesday, posting a net income of 67 cents per share, up from 51 cents per share for the same period the year before. That beat expectations of 58 cents per share on the back of box office hits such as Toy Story 3 and Iron Man 2.Fear of greater competition pushed Amazon.com lower by 3.2 per cent to $125.89 and Ebay down by 3 per cent to $21.25 after Chinese e-commerce operator Alibaba.com said it was looking to buy more US companies to expand its overseas business.In deal news, American International Group agreed to sell an 80 per cent

The S&P 500 had fallen 1.4 per cent in early trading. Six of the 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 remained down.Before the decision, the markets fell as investors were concerned that the Fed might follow the Bank of Japan and keep monetary policy unchanged.The US indices had risen on Monday on hopes that the Fed might introduce further quantitative easing.The Fed left benchmark overnight interest rates steady in a zero to 0.25 per cent range, as expected.Markets were also concerned by a report that showed an unexpected decline in US non-farm productivity, the first decline since the end of 2008, with companies finding it harder to keep cutting costs even though labour costs barely edged up.Weaker-than-expected import data from China also weighed on sentiment, pushing materials stocks down. The S&P 500 materials sector suffered the sharpest fall in the index, dropping 1 per cent.Both Alcoa, the largest US aluminium producer, and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s second-biggest copper producer, and Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore producer, fell after the Chinese data softened metal prices.Alcoa dropped 2.7 per cent to $11.35, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 2 per cent to $73.21 and Cliffs Natural Resources sank 2 per cent to $61.23.Oil prices also fell after the news from China with knock-on effects for producers: ExxonMobil fell 0.8 per cent to $61.93, Conoco Phillips lost 0.8 per cent to $56.87 and Chevron slipped 0.3 per cent to $79.04.Nuance Communications, the speech recognition technology supplier, missed analysts’ estimates with third-quarter sales of $273.2m coming in below a consensus forecast of $301m even though profits beat expectations. The shares slid 10.9 per cent to $15.47.In earnings news, shares of MBIA soared 4.5 per cent to $9.60 after it posted a 45 per cent jump in earnings in the second quarter because of a change in the value of derivatives contracts. Net income rose to $6.32 a share for the quarter compared with $4.30 for the same period last year.Software manufacturer Novell sank 3.2 per cent to $5.82 after it cut its third- quarter revenue outlook.Best Buy, the electricals retailer, dropped 2.8 per cent to $34.57 after Goldman Sachs cut its rating from “buy” to “neutral”.
340;COP;Conocophillips;2010-08-03T22:14:24Z;US food and drinks groups drawn to Russia;PepsiCo, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola to keep investing in country;The promise of the Russian consumer market has emerged as a big theme of earnings reports from US food and drinks companies, with PepsiCo, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola all singing its praises in their review of second-quarter results.The positive comments last week stand in contrast with the announcement by ConocoPhillips, the US energy group, that it was selling its stake in Lukoil, the Russian oil company.PepsiCo, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola all said they planned to keep investing in Russia.McDonald’s, for example, is planning to open 45 restaurants in Russia this year and add drive-through windows to many of its existing outlets.“Russia has been one of our top investment markets for capital expenditures,” McDonald’s said.PepsiCo also expressed optimism about a market where it has operated since 1959, when Russia was part of the Soviet Union.With sales of more than $2bn a year, PepsiCo is the largest multinational food and beverage company in Russia.“It’s the largest consumer goods market in Europe,” said Zein Abdalla, PepsiCo Europe chief executive. “You have 140m consumers with some of the world’s largest oil reserves. That’s a formula for success.”In 2008, PepsiCo acquired Lebedyansky, the leading Russian juice company. Mr Abdallah said Russia’s low per-capita consumption of ready-to-drink juices and teas as well as savoury snacks presents a tremendous upside.Sales of Coca-Cola’s flagship brand in Russia grew 19 per cent in the second quarter over the year-earlier period, although Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chief executive, told investors not to expect steady, predictable results.“My 30-plus years’ experience, at that time with the Soviet Union and then later in the last 20 years with Russia, has always been that it is very volatile,” he said. “It goes into deep economic issues . . . and it comes out very quickly.”Vladimir Pantyushin, Russia economist at Barclays Capital, said: “What will determine the continued success of the multinational is the fact that consumers have now put the [financial] crisis behind them and are ready to spend.“In the US and UK and every western country, there are heavy debt levels and consumers are concerned about cleaning up their balance sheet. This is not the case in Russia. The wallet is pretty much open.”
341;COP;Conocophillips;2010-07-29T21:51:33Z;Stability crucial to US investment, warns Statoil;;Statoil has warned US authorities that oil companies need a “stable and predictable” regulatory environment if they are to press ahead with investments in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP oil spill.The Norwegian group has invested more than $11bn over recent years to become one of the biggest holders of deepwater drilling licences off the US Gulf coast.“We understand that, after such a tragic accident, US authorities need time to address the implications and we are prepared for stricter regulations,” said Helge Lund, chief executive. “But it is important that, when they reach their conclusions, they conclude with a stable and predictable framework because these are big investments.”His comments echoed those of Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, who warned on Wednesday that US Senate proposals for oil companies to face unlimited liabilities for future spills would drive away investment.Statoil halted work on five exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico after the US placed a six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling in May.Mr Lund said the BP disaster had also set back the prospect of fresh exploration in the Arctic as the Norwegian government stalls on a long-awaited decision on potential drilling around the environmentally-sensitive Lofoten Islands. “They have indicated that they will delay their decision until the lessons from the Gulf of Mexico accident [can be considered],” he said.Statoil, 67 per cent owned by the Norwegian government, is eager for access to untapped Arctic reserves to offset decline in its mature North Sea fields.In addition to the US and Norway, the group has developed deep-water assets off Africa and South America, reinforcing its status as one of the world’s top offshore producers. Strong demand from emerging markets helped Statoil register a sharp jump in second-quarter profits as production rose 6 per cent and average oil prices gained nearly a third.Mr Lund said oil prices had stabilised at about $70-$80 a barrel but acknowledged increased uncertainty over the outlook amid mixed signals from the US and European economies and signs of a slowdown in China.Natural gas prices were down 12 per cent during the quarter as surging supplies from newly exploited US shale gas deposits weighed on the market.Statoil is Europe’s second biggest gas producer after Gazprom of Russia.Mr Lund said the gas market would remain under pressure in the medium term but insisted that the long-term outlook was still positive. “It’s hard to imagine a scenario where gas does not have a bigger role to play in the future,” he said.Net profits were NKr3.6bn ($589m), up from NKr77m last year. Revenues rose 23 per cent to NKr129.2bn.Statoil shares fell 4 per cent to NKr126.
342;COP;Conocophillips;2010-07-29T00:32:48Z;Conoco to sell stake in Russia’s Lukoil;;ConocoPhillips on Wednesday said it would sell its entire stake in Lukoil, bringing to a close its attempt to use the partnership with Russia’s second-biggest oil producer to develop business in the country.Jim Mulva, Conoco chief executive, said the Lukoil investment had been aimed at doing joint deals and these had not happened.Merger and acquisition opportunities had become few and far between, were very expensive, and raised questions about whether they created shareholder value, Mr Mulva said.“The world really has changed.’’The US group has invested about $7.5bn in Lukoil since 2004 and Mr Mulva said it was expecting to sell its entire 20 per cent stake for about $10bn.Conoco, which had said it would sell half of its stake, said the decision to dispose of its entire holding in Lukoil was part of efforts to raise funds to repurchase shares and cut debt.The US group is trying to refocus its business to improve returns to shareholders.Conoco, the third-biggest oil company in the US, recorded a loss of $17bn for 2008, when the recession exposed weaknesses in its portfolio.It is selling $10bn in assets on top of the Lukoil stake.Conoco will sell two-fifths of its holding of Lukoil shares back to the company for $3.4bn in the third quarter. The remaining three-fifths of Conoco’s shares will be sold in the open market or to Lukoil by the end of 2011.Conoco’s second-quarter adjusted earnings were $2.5bn, or $1.67 per share, excluding a net benefit of $1.7bn, mostly from “dispositions” and an impairment.In the year-earlier quarter, adjusted earnings were $982m, or 66 cents a share.In addition to asset sales, the improvement was a result of higher commodity prices and the better climate for refining and marketing.During the quarter, Conoco generated $3.5bn in cash from operations and $5.8bn in cash proceeds from asset sales.The cash was used to pay down $2.7bn in debt, fund a $2.2bn capital programme, repurchase $400m of Conoco stock and pay $800m in dividends.The group had a cash balance of $4.1bn at the end of the quarter, most of which will be used to pay debt.As of June 30, debt was $26.3bn.Conoco said it would be comfortable with debt of $22bn-$23bn, down from its high of $30.5bn in 2009.Additional reporting by Catherine Belton in Moscow
343;COP;Conocophillips;2010-07-28T21:00:03Z;Wall St falls on durable goods data and poor forecasts;;US equities fell on Wednesday after lower-than-expected orders for durable goods, a mixed picture from the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book and cautious outlooks from Boeing and ArcelorMittal weighed on market sentiment.The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent at 1,106.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 10,497.88 and the Nasdaq was 1 per cent lower to close at 2,264.56.Before the opening bell, data showing unexpectedly low orders for durable goods added to concerns that economic growth may have slowed in the second quarter. New orders for long-lasting US manufactured goods dropped 1 per cent in June after a revised 0.8 per cent fall in May, making the decline the largest since last August. Analysts had expected orders to rise 1 per cent.But the markets did not fall any further when the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book was released later in the day. The Book, which is a wider survey of business, said that the US economy was growing but that there were signs of a slowdown in some regions over the past two months.The S&P has hovered around its 200-day moving average for a third session in a row. Ray Velazquez, managing director of Mizuho Securities, said that in spite of a better than expected earnings season stocks would trade in a tight range for the next quarter or two. He said concerns about the economy meant investors would pay little attention to a stock’s fundamentals until unemployment came down.Both Boeing and ArcelorMittal beat expectations in the second quarter but were cautious about the rest of the year.Boeing reported a second-quarter net profit of $1.06 per share, beating the forecast of $1.01 per share. But the aircraft manufacturer said its profit outlook was lower than analysts’ consensus. The shares dropped 1.9 per cent to $67.32.US-listed shares in ArcelorMittal fell 2.8 per cent to $31.11 after it was also cautious about its outlook, warning that the combination of slowing growth in China, a seasonal drop in activity and higher raw material costs would push down third-quarter earnings by up to 30 per cent.The world’s biggest steelmaker beat expectations in its second quarter, with net income at $1.7bn, after a loss of $792m for the same quarter of last year.Century Aluminum plummeted 9.3 per cent to $9.57 after it reported lower-than-expected net earnings of $5.1m for the second quarter, which were helped by a gain on forward contracts.Some companies did rise after reporting earnings, with Sprint Nextel nudging up 0.2 per cent to $4.84. The US mobile phone carrier said its net loss had widened to $760m, or 25 cents a share, from $384m, or 13 cents, a year earlier. But fewer monthly bill-paying customers left than analysts had expected.The world’s largest commercial real estate broker, CB Richard Ellis Group, jumped 7.6 per cent to $16.58 after it moved into the black and reported its strongest revenue growth since 2007. It announced earnings of 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of 2 cents per share a year ago.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group , was flat at $54.44. It reported better than expected profit for the quarter and said it would sell its stake in Lukoil, Russia’s largest independent oil company.Shares in CVS Caremark, the largest US provider of prescription drugs, rose 3.1 per cent to $31.54 after the company signed a 12-year contract with Aetna, the health insurer, and in spite of it lowering its forecasts. For the full year, earnings excluding some items will be at least $2.68 a share, compared with an earlier minimum of $2.77.Comcast shares rose 1.2 per cent to $19.56 after it reported a better than expected 6 per cent rise in quarterly revenue. But the cable company’s profit was cut by fees paid as part of its acquisition of NBC Universal, falling to $884m compared with $967m for the same period a year before.In deal news, American Oil & Gas gained 6.3 per cent to $7.11. Hess Corporation will acquire the oil and gas exploration and development company.
344;COP;Conocophillips;2010-07-22T18:18:38Z;White House firm on deepwater drilling ban;;Ken Salazar, US secretary of interior, insisted on Thursday that the moratorium on new deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico would remain in place in the face of tough questioning on Capitol Hill about the economic impact of the six-month ban.Mr Salazar also said a $1bn (€775m, £655m) spill response system being developed by ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips was a “beginning point” in preventing another disaster. But it was not enough in itself to end the moratorium.Three issues must be addressed – spill prevention, response and clean-up – before the moratorium, which runs until November, would be lifted, Mr Salazar said. If, at any point, they were fully addressed, then the Obama administration would revisit the issue of the moratorium.Until then, Michael Bromwich, head of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, would hold planned meetings on the Gulf Coast with the public, government representatives, academics, environmentalists and the oil and gas industry about what measures were needed.“There is a tremendous amount of work that is unfolding,’’ Mr Salazar said.The comments came as Mr Salazar and Mr Bromwich were grilled in a hearing before the House committee on oversight and government reform about the wide range of problems in the interior department’s offshore regulatory division. The division – previously called the Minerals Management Service – is now called the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement.The committee focused on why the MMS had failed to perform safety inspections on the BP-contracted rig before it exploded on April 20 and had yet to provide reassurances that BP’s Atlantis platform did not have risks as raised by a whistleblower.Mr Salazar was accused of spending too much time promoting renewable energy and even healthcare reform and the administration’s stimulus plan when so much was wrong within his own agency.He countered that he had probably spent more time on the comprehensive energy plan that the Obama administration is championing than any other issue: “We cover a lot of ground.’’Other criticisms were on poor royalty collection, which Mr Salazar said would be addressed, and the ethical issues presented by staffers who came from the oil and gas industry they regulated.Mr Bromwich said there had been problems attracting qualified inspectors, but working to do so would be a priority. “We are committed to delivering on reforms that are needed to ensure that America’s offshore energy resources are developed safely and responsibly,’’ he said.
345;COP;Conocophillips;2010-07-21T22:39:29Z;Oil groups form $1bn spill response unit;;Four of the world’s biggest oil companies announced on Wednesday that they were pooling $1bn to form a joint venture to develop a deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil spill response and containment system.ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips will each initially invest 25 per cent in a new standalone company. BP has not been included.The role of the venture will be to develop and have available in the waters of the Gulf equipment to prevent another spill on the scale suffered by BP’s Macondo well. The joint venture will permit others operating in the deepwater fields to join, allowing them to access the equipment in case they have an accident.The venture is seen as an attempt by the oil groups to secure permission to return to deepwater drilling in the Gulf after the US government implemented a moratorium on new deepwater drilling in the wake of the BP spill.The joint venture’s equipment will consist of: a containment vessel, capable of capturing up to 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and other high-tech pieces of equipment that can be laid on the surface of the ocean bed to siphon any leaking oil up to the containment vessel.”This will be state-of-the-art response equipment,” one company said. “In the event the unthinkable happens, we will be able to respond within 24 hours of the incident.”Following the BP spill, the oil industry as a whole was criticised for not being adequately prepared for a massive blowout, which in the case of Macondo has left a well leaking uncontrollably for three months.However, the political pressure on the Obama administration to lift the moratorium on deep water drilling in the Gulf has been growing, given the state of the US economy and unemployment figures.”The moratorium is a meat axe approach which unnecessarily damages innocent parties and could crush a huge, highly successful component of the American economy,” said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, a consultancy.The new joint venture spill response company could well give the Obama administration the backdoor it needs to lift the moratorium.The White House praised the proposed venture as a positive first step, though it also underscored that the ongoing investigation of the causes of the Deepwater Horizon disaster would ultimately dictate the kinds of safety regulatory reforms that will be needed to make deepwater drilling safe.Democrat Congressman Edward Markey, BP’s most vociferous critic on Capitol Hill, said the oil industry needed to do more.“While this could be a rapidly deployed system, the oil companies must do better than BP’s current apparatus with a fresh coat of paint,” he said.Earlier on Wednesday, Thad Allen, the highest-ranking US official dealing with the day-to-day response to the BP spill, said new leaks had been found in the Macondo well’s blowout preventer, which failed on the day of the explosion.
346;COP;Conocophillips;2010-07-21T22:20:07Z;Good feedback on spill recovery plan;;The decision by the world’s biggest oil companies to form a $1bn joint oil spill response venture has been seen as a significant move in persuading the US to lift the moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico imposed after BP’s accident.The $1bn spill response joint venture being formed by the majors will complement efforts already underway to tighten deepwater drilling regulations to prevent an accident. Until now, some analysts had complained there was still no concrete plan to respond in case an accident took place.“This is exactly what was lacking,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at the James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy. “It should be a key factor in the decision to get them back out in the Gulf.”The oil majors said they had discussed the plan to form the nonprofit – to be led by ExxonMobil – with the Obama administration and some members of Congress, and feedback had generally been good.“It is a positive and proactive response to get the industry back to work,” said Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, who, along with ExxonMobil, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell, is forming the venture.He considered this the second part of a three-step process to regain confidence in deepwater drilling. The first is to raise drilling standards, which already is being done.The containment system addresses the second point – what to do in case of an accident. The third point, still to be addressed, is how to improve the clean-up process should oil still hit the water.“As an industry, we must rebuild trust with the American people in order to demonstrate that we can produce energy in a safe and environmentally responsible manner,” said Marvin Odum, president of Shell Oil Company.BP’s accident tarred the entire industry by illustrating even the world’s biggest oil companies had no plan in place for accidents in the deepwater where they have been increasingly drilling.The Obama administration responded to the accident by imposing a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling, which is to run through to November. But it has been under immense pressure to lift the moratorium, given the importance of the industry to Gulf Coast economies and energy supply.The Gulf accounts for 30 per cent of domestic oil production and 13 per cent of US natural gas production. And 20 of the top producing wells are located in the deepwater, according to the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group.“This is the beginning of a real solution,” said Raoul LeBlanc of PFC Energy, the consultancy. “A billion dollars tells us that the companies understand that they still have to create, build and test equipment that will be able to reliably get the job done quickly.”Nonetheless, the industry hopes it will never have to put the equipment to a real-time test.“If we all do our jobs properly, this system will never be used,” said Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil’s chief executive.But Edward Markey, chairman of the House energy and environment sub-committee, said: “This is only one possible tool in what must be a more robust tool kit for oil companies to respond to spills.” He said, “This could be a positive step, but it cannot be the industry’s last.”“The proposal these companies are submitting is essentially the current BP cap system and plan for 100 per cent collection of oil. While this could be a rapidly deployed system, the oil companies must do better than BP’s current apparatus with a fresh coat of paint.”.
347;COP;Conocophillips;2010-07-09T08:04:08Z;Santos in talks to sell Gladstone LNG stake;;Santos, the Australian energy group, is holding talks with several companies interested in buying part of its stake in the Gladstone liquefied natural gas project, the company said on Friday.The statement followed Australian media reports that Santos was close to sealing a deal with Royal Dutch Shell under which the Anglo-Dutch energy company would pay about A$2bn ($1.75bn) for a third of the Queensland–based Gladstone project.With the uncertainty of Australia’s proposed resources super tax removed, such a deal would probably hasten consolidation of the LNG industry in Australia.Di Brookman, an oil and gas analyst at CLSA, said a Shell deal would be good for Santos shareholders.“It reduces operational risk by bringing in an experienced LNG operator and …reduces the need for Santos to issue new equity,” said Ms Brookman. “The net affect is a significant reduction of risk to Santos shareholders.”Shell declined to comment. Santos also refused to comment because discussions were incomplete. However, the company did say there was “collaboration between projects” although it did not provide any detail.The Santos statement fuelled speculation that a deal with Shell would be followed by a merger of Gladstone LNG and rival Arrow coal-seam-gas-to-LNG project. A joint venture between Shell and PetroChina is in the process of acquiring Arrow for $3bn.The Arrow project involves building up to four LNG processing plants with capacity of about 4m tonnes a year. Gladstone LNG has plans for two plants with capacity of about 3.6m tonnes a year each. Combining the two projects would save on infrastructure and equipment costs.Analysts expect a tie-up could spur a similar pairing of the other Queensland LNG consortiums – Australia’s Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips, and BG Group.China’s Sinopec Corp and South Korea’s state-run Korea Gas Corp are also expected to buy small stakes in the Gladstone project. According to Australian media, they are close to signing long-term sales agreements with Santos.Analysts say a tie-up with Shell would cut the chances of Santos having to tap the debt market or raise equity. With rising capital costs to build the LNG conversion facility, the market has been worried that Santos would again go to the equity market to raise substantial capital.Santos has been trying to sell part of its stake in Gladstone over the past year to reduce its funding requirements. It wants to secure new LNG buyers for the project, which will develop reserves of coal-bed methane to produce liquefied natural gas in the Australian state of Queensland.Analysts claim Santos has struggled to find buyers and would have difficulties in developing the LNG plants.Santos now holds a 60 per cent stake in Gladstone LNG, while Malaysian state-owned energy giant Petronas owns 40 per cent.The Gladstone project, which will have an initial production capacity of 3.4m tonnes a year, is slated to start production in 2014.
348;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Stakes high for warring oil spill partners;;One of the bitterest battles resulting from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the dispute between BP, operator of the Macondo well, and Anadarko, its biggest junior partner.On June 18, after Anadarko’s credit rating had been downgraded to junk, Jim Hackett, chief executive, launched an attack on BP. He said the accident could have been avoided and that BP would likely be found to have acted with “gross negligence or wilful misconduct”.He said he was “shocked” at what he had learnt from documents that became publicly available after the accident.What he did not mention was that Anadarko knew and even approved some of the most controversial decisions BP made, ones that US lawmakers have given as examples of BP cutting corners to cut costs.Lawmakers, in the course of congressional hearings into what caused the disater, have raised concerns about Macondo’s basic well design, the technology used and about BP’s execution of the development of the well.Executives from Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, all peers of BP and Anadarko, have testified that they would have done things differently than the partners at Macondo.Royal Dutch Shell, for example, said it would not have used the well design approved by Anadarko, BP and Mitsui, the third partner, for use at this type of deepwater exploration well.Marvin Odum, president of Shell, told a Congressional hearing in mid-June: “It’s not a well that we would have drilled in that mechanical set-up.”In contrast, Anadarko says that the accident was caused purely because of BP’s faulty execution, not the design or the technology.“What we knew was that the design, the long string and the use of centralisers all met industry standards if executed correctly. The problems were caused by BP’s execution of each of these,” Anadarko said.A long string is a cheaper way of lining a well but one that gives less protection against gas leaks than using multiple layers, including liners and casings, while centralisers stabilise a well before it is cemented.Industry executives on and outside the Macondo project agree that BP, not Anadarko, called the shots on the Deepwater Horizon and had more information on what went into day-to-day decisions than its partners, which did not have a representative on the rig on a regular basis.However, Anadarko was kept abreast of what was going on each morning when BP sent it a report of what happened at the rig in the previous 24 hours, both companies said. The report included information such as well test results, the technical procedures that had been undertaken and any unexpected challenges, such as a surge in gas.“BP gave or made available to the co-owners Authorisation for Expenditure (AFE) documents, supplemental AFE documents, daily operations reports, and other documents that showed the well design, changes to the well design, and identified big well control events encountered during drilling operations,” BP said in an e-mail in response to Financial Times’ questions. “Further, personnel from the co-owners engaged in periodic communications with BP personnel about well design and other issues related to the well.”Anadarko says that, still, it did not have enough data, to throw up red flags.For example, Anadarko says it knew of BP’s decision on April 16 to use only six centralisers despite the challenging nature of the well. However, Anadarko says it was only told of the decision after the centralisers had been put in place and was not aware that BP’s decision contradicted advice from Halliburton, the contractor on the rig.Anadarko also did not know of at least two of the most controversial decisions BP made, executives from both sides acknowledge. That is because those calls were made within the final 24 hours of the life of the well, executives said.Thus, the fate of Anadarko will depend on whether investigators and courts decide that the Macondo well was flawed from the onset, or whether the decisions BP made – especially in the critical final 24 hours – were what caused the accident.The stakes are high for both parties.If BP alone is indeed found guilty of gross negligence or wilful misconduct, Anadarko and Mitsui will not have to pay their share of the cost of the clean up and the liabilities that have arisen from the accident.For Anadarko, in particular, that decision could be the difference between life and death given its size and the fact that no one knows how much those liabilities would be, analysts say.
349;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Venezuela to nationalise US oil rigs;;Venezuela is nationalising 11 oil rigs belonging to US driller Helmerich & Payne, the latest in a series of takeovers in President Hugo Chávez’s drive to create a socialist economy in the middle of a recession.Battling a fall in oil output and rising inflation, Mr Chávez’s government has been tightening its grip over the economy in recent years – nationalising electricity, steel and cement companies as well as a handful of banks. Mr Chávez has also threatened to take over Polar, the nation’s top food producer.Helmerich & Payne, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, had halted work on all 11 of its Venezuela rigs for months following an extended dispute with state-run Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, over payment.Rafael Ramirez, oil minister, alleged Wednesday that the move was part of a plot to reduce crude production by sectors opposed to Mr Chávez’s government.“There’s a group of oil rig owners that has refused to discuss rates and services with PDVSA,” Mr Ramirez said in a statement. “This is specifically the case with Helmerich & Payne …We’re not going to allow them to sabotage our operations.”A spokesperson for Helmerich & Payne was not immediately available for comment.PDVSA racked up billions of dollars in debts with contractors last year as it renegotiated contracts in a bid to reduce costs by 40 per cent. Mr Ramirez later said that PDVSA was paying down those debts, but complaints from some companies continued.The largely pro-Chávez National Assembly also approved a law enabling PDVSA to take over contractors without following the usual procedures to expropriate business, and Mr Chávez ordered the nationalisations of dozens of smaller service companies.PDVSA had earlier taken over a rig owned by Dallas-based Ensco International after it suspended operations, saying it was owed $35m. Other foreign rig operators, including Halliburton and Schlumberger, continue to work in Venezuela and maintain cordial relations with the government.In 2007, Mr Chávez nationalized four major oil projects, prompting Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips to leave the country and file for international arbitration rather than accept a minority stake.But other foreign companies, including Chevron, stayed on, and earlier this year, Venezuela inked deals with Chevron, Repsol YPF and other investors to develop new fields in the same oil-producing region in eastern Venezuela.Venezuela relies on oil for 95 per cent of exports, but crude production has slumped slightly over the past two years – to 2.25m barrels per day in May, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
350;COP;Conocophillips;2010-06-21T03:22:07Z;BP needs to get a grip of any post-disaster assets sale;With the group’s credit rating hovering around junk, avoiding a fire sale will be tricky;One funding option for the $20bn escrow account BP has set up to pay claims from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is to sell $10bn of non-core assets. But with the group’s credit rating hovering around junk, avoiding a fire sale will be tricky.Pre-disaster costs, Citigroup valued the oil group’s assets at $234bn. That is almost double the company’s current enterprise value, including net debt and minority investments, of $125bn.Despite this, analysts believe BP will achieve top dollar for the assets it tries to offload – such as oil and gas fields that are not central to its operations.Certainly, there will be interested buyers. Domestic oil companies need M&A to secure access to resources and capabilities, while international oil companies are looking for upstream opportunities and potential growth areas, such as Brazil and unconventional natural gas.But BP’s divestment programme will be in competition with ConocoPhilips , the third-largest US oil company by market value, which is in the middle of its own $10bn divestment programme.With this in mind, the key to ensuring BP can extract as much value as possible from potential buyers is to stay in control of the sale process.BP may want to look at how AB InBev managed its divestment programme at the peak of the crisis in 2008. The brewing group, which needed to sell $7bn worth of assets to pay down debt it incurred following InBev’s $52bn takeover of Anheuser-Busch, marketed more assets than it needed to, offering buyers a good variety to choose from.That allowed it to turn down any opportunistic, low-ball offers and extract the best value from buyers. The result was that it sold $9.4bn of assets, far exceeding its original goal.BP has other funding options – including $5bn of cash and more than $10bn in undrawn committed banking lines – so it should be able to hold out for a full price on those assets it chooses to sell.BP has already lost control of so much. Losing a grip on the sale of assets is not an option.lina.saigol@ft.com
351;COP;Conocophillips;2010-06-15T23:48:41Z;Sharp increase in BP spill estimate;;The Obama administration has sharply lifted its estimate of the amount of oil gushing into the Mexican gulf because of the BP disaster to 60,000 barrels a day.If accurate, the new figure signified that a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez catastrophe could be occurring every four days.The news was released just hours before President Barack Obama was set to address the nation about his vision for the future of US energy policy. It also coincided with a contentious congressional hearing in which the world’s top oil companies were charged by lawmakers of being just as unprepared as BP to handle a big oil spill.Democrats on a House energy panel, who reviewed the companies’ emergency response plans, said they all relied on equally ineffective “cookie cutter” contingency plans.One top executive, Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil, countered the claim by pointing a finger of blame at BP, telling the congressional sub-committee that the Deepwater Horizon accident would have been preventable if “established procedures” had been followed.In their first joint appearance before Congress since the rig explosion, Mr Tillerson and representatives of Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips and Shell sought to convince lawmakers that offshore drilling – if done properly – was safe and that the accident was an anomaly.But Henry Waxman, House energy committee chairman, said a review of the companies’ response plans – which contained near-identical passages and were written by the same company, the Response Group – proved Congress needed to put “teeth” into enforcement rules.“On paper, these plans look reassuring . . . But when you look at the details, it becomes evident these plans are just paper exercises. BP failed miserably when confronted with a real leak and ExxonMobil and other companies would do no better,” Mr Waxman said.Edward Markey, who chairs the sub-committee on energy and environment, added that like BP, three of the companies had described their ability to protect walruses in the Gulf – a marine mammal that has not inhabited the region for “three million years”.Mr Obama on Tuesday night renewed his case for clean energy legislation that would reduce the US’s reliance on fossil fuels and appealed to both Republicans and Democrats to rally together to change energy policy.The new oil flow estimates came after Fitch downgraded BP’s credit rating by six notches. The ratings agency said the cut was due in part to last week’s government estimates of a “significantly higher spill” rate.

353;COP;Conocophillips;2010-06-15T18:24:07Z;BP blame game fails to win over Congress;;In 2008, it must have appeared to the US oil industry the biggest threat to its future was the election of a president who supported development of a green economy and a system to curb carbon emissions.But on Tuesday, as they sat before lawmakers, executives of four of the world’s largest oil companies seemed to acknowledge that the most difficult challenge they faced sprung not from liberals in the halls of Congress, but from the actions of one of their own.One by one, Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil, James Watson of Chevron, Marvin Odum of Shell and James Mulva of ConocoPhillips listed the things they would have done differently to BP in the weeks and months before the Deepwater rig explosion that killed 11 men and has spilled 1.6m barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico so far. “It appears clear to me that a number of design standards that I would consider the industry norm were not followed,” Mr Tillerson said. “We would not have drilled the well the way they did.”The ExxonMobil chief pointed to the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 – describing it as a low-point, and a turning point, in the company’s history. “We do not proceed with operations if we cannot do so safely,” he said.Asked by Henry Waxman, chairman of the House energy committee, whether the BP disaster could have been prevented, Mr Watson of Chevron chimed in: “Not all standards we would recommend were in place. For example, the casing design and mechanical barriers appear to be different than what we would use.”But despite the relative rarity of deep-water drilling accidents, Mr Waxman and others eyeing a regulatory overhaul of the energy sector were sceptical of the oil companies’ claims that the BP spill was a one-off catastrophe that would not have happened to them.Mr Waxman made clear that he was not convinced by documents provided to the energy committee by the companies that their plans to deal with big oil spills were more effective than BP’s. Instead, the plans were largely identical and written by the same company. They even had the same cover, though with different colours.Edward Markey, who chairs the subcommittee on energy and environment, added that like BP, three companies had described in their plans their ability to protect walruses in the gulf – a marine mammal that has not inhabited the region for “3 million years”. “It’s unfortunate that walruses were included and it is embarrassing that they were included,” said Mr Tillerson.While Republicans condemned any plan to impose extensive restrictions on offshore drilling, one prominent lawmaker, Joe Barton of Texas, agreed with Democratic colleagues that oil companies’ safety plans were woefully inadequate.“You can’t have a contingency plan that says, ‘cross your fingers’ and hope the blow-out preventer works,” Mr Barton said. “Where I disagree with chairman Waxman …is that the gentlemen before us have the wherewithal, the expertise, and they certainly have the incentive, to put that plan together.”Oil executives tried to convey two messages: that they operate – in the words of James Watson of Chevron – by “public permission” and needed to prove they could do so safely, and that moves to curb US offshore oil production would have disastrous consequences for energy security and the US economy. “The Deepwater Horizon accident tragically reinforces that all companies must operate with the same high standards of safety and reliability. It is clear that failure to do so has dire consequences,” Mr Watson said.Of all the executives, Mr Tillerson most assertively questioned BP’s actions before the Deepwater accident, saying that investigators needed to determine whether it had taken risks that went “beyond the industry norm”.“What we do know is that when you properly design wells for the range of risk anticipated, follow established procedures, build in layers of redundancy, properly inspect and maintain equipment, train operators, conduct tests and drills, and focus on safe operations and risk management, tragic incidents like the one we are witnessing …should not occur,” he said.
354;COP;Conocophillips;2010-06-13T19:29:20Z;Oil groups distance themselves from BP;;"The chief executives of the world’s biggest international oil companies will testify on Tuesday that the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico “was preventable’’, publicly distancing themselves for the first time from the UK company, the Financial Times has learnt.Executives from ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips will say that by following current “best practices’’ companies can avoid such accidents, according to interviews with those who have seen the planned remarks.The majors want to use this opportunity – in front of a subcommittee of the House energy and commerce committee – to make the case for continued new drilling in the deepwater gulf. Drilling has been placed under a six-month moratorium since the oil leak began, with many in the industry fearing that the curbs might be extended.They also want to respond to the criticism that the industry was unprepared for a disaster of this scale, given the companies’ inability to help BP stop and contain the oil gushing into the Gulf since the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig.While the companies will accept “this has been a humbling experience”, the point the chief executives hope to convey is that this accident could have been avoided.One said its chief executive would discuss “our long-term safety record’’ and the various approaches it has in place to prevent spills of this sort.The companies say they incorporate into their drilling plans redundant systems to monitor pressures in wells; establish an onshore monitoring operation working in real time to help spot problems; and build well designs with multiple layers of barriers to guard against accidents.It is not clear whether BP had all of these safeguards in place as the investigation into the accident is ongoing.BP declined to comment ahead of the testimony before Congress, but reiterated its position that the various investigations ongoing will determine the cause of the explosion.Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at the James A Baker Institute for Public Policy, said that the claim by the majors that they would not have had this type of accident did not take into account the possibility of human error.While the companies have expressed support for the new safety regulations imposed on deepwater ­drilling by the Department of Interior since the accident, several said that most of the precautions are already in place. Those that are not are additional layers of verification and auditing of their safety precautions.“We’re almost there today,’’ one company said.To complicate matters, on Saturday, a Chevron pipeline leaked crude oil into a drainage creek in a residential district in Utah, contaminating birds and fish. Chevron captured 200 birds and cleaned them, but at least three had to be killed. Chevron is investigating the cause of the accident."
355;COP;Conocophillips;2010-06-06T22:07:56Z;BP told to raise US refinery safety levels;;BP has yet to sufficiently raise safety standards at its US refineries five years after a fatal accident at a Texas installation, according to an independent expert monitoring the energy company’s progress.Duane Wilson said in a report seen by the Financial Times that BP must address potentially risky levels of overtime, swiftly respond to issues raised in safety audits and be more self-critical of its safety culture.Mr Wilson was appointed in 2007 to monitor progress towards goals set by an independent panel.His third annual report, completed in March 2010, comes as BP’s safety processes are under scrutiny over its failure to stop a leak from one of its Gulf of Mexico wells that began on April 20 after an explosion on a rig killed 11 and injured 17.“While significant gaps have been closed and most of the new systems, processes, standards and practices required for continued process safety improvements have been developed, much work remains to be done to fully implement them,” Mr Wilson wrote.The panel investigated the safety culture across BP’s five US refineries on the urgent recommendation of the US Chemical Safety Board (CSB), following an explosion at BP’s Texas City refinery that killed 15 and injured at least 170 in the country’s’ biggest industrial accident in a decade. Mr Wilson, a retired refining executive for ConocoPhillips, was on the panel.BP responded to Mr Wilson’s concerns in its 2009 sustainability review, released in April 2010.In that report, Sir William Castell, chairman of BP’s safety, ethics and environment assurance committee, said the board “welcomed his continued insights, analysis and challenges,’’ highlighting Mr Wilson’s view that all continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to meeting the recommendations. This was the third year Mr Wilson found potentially risky levels of overtime, calling for “additional emphasis” on this issue. “Overtime for some individuals at all refineries remained at a level that may compromise the performance of workers,” Mr Wilson said.The CSB, which performed a two-year investigation into the disaster, said operators had worked 29 or more consecutive 12-hours shifts prior to the 2005 disaster and were likely fatigued when the accident occurred. Some process safety audit action items have due dates that appear too long, given the apparent risks associated with them, Mr Wilson said, noting 11 per cent had their due dates extended in 2009.In addition, Mr Wilson said, slow delivery of completed incident investigation reports continued.Two accidents at one refinery in 2009, he noted, involved the same piece of equipment.BP said, in addition to highlighting the areas requiring additional further attention, which it would continue to address, the report highlighted progress made.It noted the report underlined that the board, executive management, and refining management all continued to demonstrate a strong commitment to delivering, and deploying substantial resources towards the independent panel’s recommendations while describing the board and management as demonstrating an exemplary focus on process safety.
356;COP;Conocophillips;2010-05-25T21:06:49Z;Oil rig safety inspectors accepted ‘gifts’, report finds;;US safety regulators allowed oil and gas company officials to fill out inspection forms on oil platforms, which were then signed and dated by the safety officials, according to a claim contained in a report by federal investigators.The claim, which was made by a confidential source and included in a newly released report by the inspector-general of the Department of the Interior, was one of several new allegations to discredit the Minerals Management Service, the federal regulator charged with oversight of offshore drilling.The MMS is already under fire for its handling of BP’s oil drilling applications, which lawmakers have said included cursory – and in some cases, non-existent – reviews of safety and environmental protection issues.The scathing report, one in a series of damning investigations into the MMS conducted over the years by the inspector-general’s office and the Government Accountability Office, chronicled events prior to 2007. But the acting inspector-general said on Tuesday she felt compelled to release it following the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig, which killed 11 men and has sent thousands of barrels of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico.The IG’s office said it had initiated the investigation after receiving an anonymous letter in October 2008 that was addressed to the US attorneys office in New Orleans and alleged that MMS employees had accepted gifts from oil and gas companies.The report is likely to fuel the perception that regulators were asleep on the job – and worse, that they were complicit in helping oil and gas companies get around the rules.The Obama administration has announced initial steps for a revamp of the MMS, which is part of the Department of the Interior, including making safety inspectors independent from the bureau that collects revenue from oil and gas companies.In one case, a confidential source who was cited in the report claimed one MMS inspector was a user of crystal methamphetamine and “might have” used the drug while offshore on platforms. During an interview with investigators, the inspector admitted to using the drug and said he “might have been” under the influence at work after using it a day earlier.In one e-mail exchange unearthed by the IG, a former MMS inspector told an employee at ConocoPhillips that he had accepted gifts from certain “good friends” in the oil industry. The 2006 exchange began when the then inspector e-mailed the Conoco employee with a list of fines that it had assessed in the first quarter.“Ever get bribed for some of that?” the Conoco employee asked. “They try all the time,” the inspector responded. Asked then if he ever accepted, the inspector said: “I accept ‘gifts’ from certain people. But we have very strict ethical standards as you could imagine.”Mary Kendall, acting inspector-general of the interior department, said inspectors’ relationships with the industry were of particular concern.“We discovered that the individuals involved in the fraternising and gift exchange – both government and industry – have often known one another since childhood,” she said.

358;COP;Conocophillips;2010-05-25T15:55:40Z;Middle East: Shortages point to need for efficiency;;Last month a senior international oil executive described a problem facing the Middle East as a “puzzle”.Malcolm Brinded, executive director of upstream international business at Royal Dutch Shell, was referring to a gas shortage facing countries across one of the world’s most hydrocarbon-rich regions.The Middle East is home to more than 40 per cent of the world’s proven gas reserves, and with scope for discoveries, is set to play a “pivotal role” in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, Mr Brinded said.Yet many of the region’s states face the more immediate challenge of meeting rising domestic power demand and while there is a lot of gas, few countries have adequate supplies onstream.“This is the puzzle that needs to be solved,” Mr Brinded said in a speech in Kuwait.The bulk of the region’s gas lies in two countries – Iran, which boasts the world’s second-largest proven gas reserves, and Qatar, which has the world’s largest natural gas reservoir, the North Field.Nearly two-thirds of the Middle East gas outside these two countries is “associated” gas, which means it is tied to oil production, according to Shell. Meanwhile, much of the remaining gas not linked to oil is either “sour,” meaning it is highly toxic, or “tight”, making it expensive and technically challenging to develop.And for years, little attention was paid to the resource.Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, for example, has only recently begun building a pipeline that will enable it to bring onshore gas produced at sea. Although it has world’s sixth-largest proven gas reserves, it is a net importer of gas.The problem is exacerbated as Arab Gulf states seek to use their petrodollar wealth to develop and diversify their economies with a focus on energy-intensive industries.This increases domestic demand. Energy subsidies are also widespread across the region, which has encouraged a culture of waste and inefficiency.Kuwait and the UAE are already importing gas, while Saudi Arabia is burning increasing amounts of oil and oil-related fuels to meet its power needs.Unless solutions are found, the growing requirements of domestic demand will affect the ability of Gulf states to export oil.“Much of the world has not woken up to the issue of domestic demand in the Middle East,” says a Gulf energy official.“It is one of those stories that is not well understood but has important ramifications for oil prices.”Khalid al-Falih, the chief executive of Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, recently warned that unless Saudi Arabia tackles inefficiencies in the way it uses energy, the kingdom’s availability of crude to export risks falling by as much as 3m barrels by 2028 to 7m barrels a day.He said that Saudi Arabia’s domestic demand is expected to rise from about 3.4m b/d of oil equivalent in 2009 to approximately 8.3m by 2028.The Gulf states are investing heavily in a bid to bring more gas onstream, but many challenges lie ahead.Saudi Arabia, which is home to the fourth-largest proven gas reserves, is exploring across the kingdom and will begin drilling in the Red Sea in 2012 for the first time.Exploration is also continuing in the vast, remote desert of its Empty Quarter, where Saudi Arabia awarded international companies exploration blocks, but there have not yet been any commercial discoveries.Aramco is also expanding its raw gas production capacity from 10bn cubic feet a day to 15.5bn cu ft a day in 2015.Kuwait, meanwhile is developing its first non-associated gas field, which it hopes will produce 1.8bn cu ft a day.Abu Dhabi has also been awarding contracts for its Shah field, a sour gas field whose development is deemed critical to the emirate’s energy strategy.However, that project suffered a setback last month when ConocoPhillips, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s joint-venture partner, announced it was withdrawing from the development, which is estimated to be costing $10bn.Adnoc is pushing ahead with the field, and an­nounced the award of $5.6bn worth of contracts days after the US company made its decision public. But the state oil company has to decide whether to proceed alone with a project that has already been delayed and is extremely challenging technically.It was hoped that Shah would start producing gas around 2013, with a production target for sales gas of between 500m and 700m cu ft a day.But John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi, says the idea the Gulf can use cheap gas to create manufacturing capacity and diversify its economies has to be “seriously questioned.”“Demand is out-stripping supply and the mismatch is challenging. Something has to give, either the region will tone down the demand it has on additional gas supplies, or find more gas, become more efficient energy users and …befriend Qatar,” he says.“But all options have limitations if they don’t all become more efficient users of energy.”
359;COP;Conocophillips;2010-05-25T15:55:32Z;Glut forces a rethink for producers;;By the end of this year, Qatar will have completed one of the most ambitious industrial revolutions of past decades and in the process helped transform the international natural gas industry.The small Gulf state this year expects to hit a natural gas export capacity of 77m tonnes a year, enough to supply all the needs of both China and Brazil.Qatar has become the biggest trader of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world and a pioneer – together with the international oil companies it employs – in improving the process whereby natural gas is super cooled and turned into liquid so it can be put on tankers and transported to distant markets.But the achievement comes at a time when halfway round the world a second, more recent natural gas revolution has also occurred, sending prices to record lows and forcing Qatar and other suppliers to adapt.While Qatar was busy building its huge LNG complex of miles of winding pipes at Ras Laffan in the barren desert 80km north-east of the capital Doha, independent oil and gas companies in Texas were cracking the technology that would finally give them access to the gas trapped in the solid shale rock scattered across large parts of the US.The process of breaking up the previously impervious rock, known as “fracking” in the industry, has unleashed a flurry of multibillion-dollar deals, including last year’s $41bn agreement by ExxonMobil to purchase XTO, the shale gas specialist.European companies, such as BP of the UK, Norway’s Statoil and Total of France have joined the rush, each buying into the shale beds and the expertise of Chesapeake Energy, one of the US’s largest gas producers.In terms of supply, the shale gas revolution has had a significant impact. In less than five years, the US has gone from seeking new sources of gas from overseas to being self sufficient.In fact, for the first time in nearly a decade, the US has regained the position of being the world’s largest producer of natural gas. Its reserves life has grown from 30 years to a century.The global recession is another significant factor that has caused huge change in the industry in the past three years.It cut sharply the need for natural gas, especially in Europe and the US, and damped demand elsewhere.The resulting “ gas glut”, as the International Energy Agency, the rich countries’ watchdog called it, has forced big suppliers such as Qatar, Algeria and Russia to adapt, as prices have fallen from a high of $13.70 per million British thermal units (mBtu) in July 2008 to lows of $2.75 per mBtu in September 2009, followed by a slight recovery to today’s price of about $4 per mBtu.Marcela Donadio, Americas oil and gas leader for Ernst & Young, notes that the oil and gas industry is one that requires executives to respond to shifts in trends swiftly.“You have to be aware that the landscape can change very quickly,” she says. “If there ever was an industry that requires people to be nimble, this is it.”Each of the main suppliers has responded in its own way.Gazprom, Russia’s gas monopoly, whose chief executive Alexei Miller predicted in 2008 that his company would be worth $1,000bn within a decade, has had to sharply curtail his ambitions.Gazprom has had to rethink its goal of developing its own LNG programme, a central part of its long-term business plan, which would have seen cargoes of Russian Arctic gas exported to the US.In the meantime, it has also had to accept demands from its European customers to reduce prices for long-term contracts by linking more of a contract’s gas to spot gas prices rather than to oil prices.Spot natural gas prices are trading well below oil prices and many analysts have criticised the old link between the two as outdated and unrepresentative of the market.Algeria has called for an even more radical solution, last month proposing that big gas suppliers form a cartel and jointly reduce their production. The pitch fell flat, largely because it was dismissed by Russia and Qatar.Qatar has been one of the suppliers least affected by the fall in prices because it had already negotiated many of its contracts for the 77m tonnes of gas before the seismic shifts in the market.And because much of its supply has been sold on a long-term basis, there is less flexibility in the price.Faisal Al-Suwaidi, chairman and chief executive of Qatargas, said in an interview: “I’d be wrong if I said we saw the breakthrough of shale gas coming. It took everyone by surprise. Has it impacted our long-range plans? Maybe, but minimally,” he added.Qatar has also had to be flexible. Much of its gas was earmarked for the US and UK, which because of lower demand and increased supply no longer need as many cargoes. As recently as this month it said it would reroute that gas to regions where growth remains more robust, such as Asia and the Middle East itself.In fact, the shift has been so significant, that China is now expected to become Qatar’s biggest buyer.The Middle East, which sits on large, but undeveloped gas resources, is also a quickly growing market for gas imports, from Qatar and further afield.“We see a huge growth of demand for energy in the Middle East. This could be a good help to projects developed that had destinations, such as the US and Europe,” Mr Al-Suwaidi said.He noted that UK demand for gas fell in the summer at precisely the time Middle East countries needed more supply because of the seasonal increase in air conditioning.Finding such solutions is also important for the international oil companies that have piled into Qatar to help it develop its LNG industry.Those companies include ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and ConocoPhillips.For many, Qatar has been a critical way of expanding their portfolios in past years when other resource-rich nations were making it more difficult to invest, especially in oil fields.Frank Harris, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, says: “Gas is becoming more important to international oil companies, driven by the fact that big new oil opportunities are becoming much harder to find and, accessing discovered oil resources is becoming increasingly tough.”He adds that the most attractive countries to do business in were those with low accessibility hurdles. These include Qatar, but also countries with “unconventional” gas resources, such as the US with its shale gas.ExxonMobil and other companies are hoping to apply the expertise they acquire from deals they recently struck in the US shale gas sector to the shale beds of Poland, Sweden, Germany and France, which are also relatively easily accessible.However, there is a chance that their appetite for natural gas could decline if prices do not recover for a long time.Mr Harris says: “I think some companies’ enthusiasm may start to wane if they decide that the global outlook for gas is genuinely bearish long-term, rather than just for the next few years.“However, others see things recovering in the medium term, as gas becomes increasingly important and valuable.”He says that he shares the more optimistic outlook.In Qatar, as it completes its 20-year building programme, the mood is also one of optimism and of the belief that, in the long term, gas will remain an important fuel source.
360;COP;Conocophillips;2010-05-20T12:51:42Z;Coalbed methane: China brings fresh source of domestic supply onstream;;Satisfying China’s boundless energy needs has become an all-consuming task for the country’s planners, who have seen oil demand double in the past decade.In recent years, oil and gas companies have been given hundreds of billions of dollars to go overseas and sign exploration and supply deals, including in some of the most volatile parts of the world.It should come as no surprise that Chinese energy officials have also been casting around for domestic solutions to their supply dilemma. A massive expansion in the nuclear industry is under way and the government has given huge support to solar and wind power, to the extent that the country is now the biggest manufacturer of solar panels and wind turbines.Much less remarked upon, however, are the sizeable investments in unconventional gas sources, particularly coalbed methane, where natural gas is extracted from coal beds, and shale gas.China has been developing coalbed methane for at least a decade and has put in place ambitious production plans. The country is the largest coal producer in the world as well as the biggest consumer, and its proven reserves of coalbed methane have reached 170bn cubic metres, the Ministry of Land and Resources announced in December, 70 per cent higher than its 2005 estimate and the third largest in the world.“We have abundant coal reserves and as a result coalbed methane production is set to grow rapidly,” says Che Changbo, a senior official at the Ministry of Land and Resources.The government has been trying to stimulate investment, offering a string of tax incentives and reduced tariffs on important components.In 2008, it ended the monopoly of state-owned China United Coalbed Methane Company, in what was considered a sign of impatience at the slow rate of investment. This has allowed PetroChina to become the biggest company in the field.Earlier in the decade, the government set a target of output of 10bn cu m this year, rising to 40bn cu m by 2020, although this year’s production capacity is likely to be closer to 2.5bn cu m.Foreign companies such as Shell and ConocoPhillips are among the big oil and gas groups with coal seam gas projects in the country, along with a group of smaller companies including London-listed Green Dragon Gas.As well as providing a new gas source, coalbed methane could bring the further advantage of improving mine safety. Gas build-ups are one reason for China’s high tally of mine accidents, so the creation of commercial incentives to release accumulated gas could bolster the industry’s safety record.China is also starting to develop deposits of shale gas, although the sector is still in its infancy. PetroChina, which estimates China may have as much as 45,000bn cu m in shale gas – more than Russia’s proven gas reserves last year – has a joint-venture to develop the resource with Shell and has begun to drill wells.The two have combined in a $3.2bn bid for Arrow Energy, an Australian company that specialises in coal seam gas.BP has a shale gas joint venture with Sinopec, China’s second-largest oil and gas group. During a visit to Beijing last autumn, Barack Obama, US president, signed an agreement to transfer US shale technology.Despite the big push from Beijing, there are still plenty of obstacles to developing unconventional gas supplies in the country. To obtain the necessary approvals often means dealing with several levels of local government and with state-owned mining companies, some of which might have a different agenda from the central government’s energy planners.Despite the huge interest from many international companies in the gas sector, Chevron last year pulled out of a series of coalbed methane projects.Transporting the gas from its source, mostly in north and western China to the big industrial markets on the east and south coasts can also be a huge logistical challenge, although a PetroChina coalbed methane project last year began to feed gas into the country’s mammoth east-west gas pipeline which stretches from Xinjiang province on the north-western border to Shanghai.Regardless of these obstacles, the likely expansion in unconventional gas supplies is giving China leverage in its projects for other gas supplies.As part of their plans to make natural gas 10 per cent of the national energy mix by 2020, China is building terminals for the import of liquefied natural gas – providing a boon to Australia which wants to expand its LNG export business.However, in January Petro­China let a deal to buy LNG from Australia’s Browse expire. It had been signed in 2007 when prices were considerably higher.It has also been negotiating hard with Gazprom of Russia over a supply deal that was signed in principle last year after several years of talks. However, pricing has not yet been agreed.The growth of its supply of unconventional gas is allowing China to drive a tougher bargain in international markets.

Kraft’s acquisition of Cadbury was approved by shareholders of both companies in February.Mr Buffett also reduced his stakes in a number of large US companies during the quarter, including Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Costco Wholesale, Gannett and Conoco Phillips.The legendary stock picker is believed to have liquidated some of his equity holdings in part to fund his $27bn purchase of Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, completed in February.The disclosure comes two weeks after he publicly criticised Kraft’s purchase of Cadbury, funded in part by its sale of Tombstone Pizza to Nestlé in January. “Both deals were dumb” he said at Berkshire’s general meeting on May 1. “The pizza deal was particularly dumb.”

363;COP;Conocophillips;2010-05-14T01:37:59Z;Australia gas deal renews tension;;East Timor is considering legal action over a multimillion-dollar helium production facility in Australia, renewing tension between the nations over vast, contested resources in the Timor Sea.To the surprise of the East Timorese government, German industrial gas producer Linde Group opened the plant in Darwin in March, signing a long-term contract to buy unpurified helium from ConocoPhillips.East Timor, which jointly holds rights to the Bayu Undan field operated by ConocoPhillips, told the Financial Times the helium is being extracted and marketed without its consent. Linde expects to produce 150m cubic feet of helium a year by refining a waste stream released during liquefied natural gas processing in Northern Australia. It is the largest helium production facility in the southern hemisphere.The fight over helium is the latest confrontation between Australia and East Timor in the disputed maritime territory that has been the focus of negotiations since it was part of Portugal in the early 1970s.Last month, Timor blocked a proposal by Australian oil giant Woodside Petroleum to process tens of billions of dollars in gas in the contested Greater Sunrise field .Under bilateral treaties between East Timor and Australia, the countries split billions of dollars in profit from the Bayu Undan site, which has enabled East Timor to build up a $6bn (€4.7bn, £4bn) National Petroleum Fund.East Timor said it was not consulted on the creation of a “secondary billion dollar (helium) industry on shore in Australia”. It said Australia’s economy was benefiting from long-term employment and private sector growth “once again, at the expense of the Timorese”.Timor, a former Portuguese colony of 1.1m people, gained independence eight years ago after a brutal 24-year Indonesian occupation that left hundreds of thousands dead. The government has made it a priority to tap its resources and reduce towering unemployment and poverty.Government lawyers are examining how to claim a share of profit from the helium, which it said is a “sovereign resource” protected under its constitution. The bilateral treaties with Australia do not allow for unilateral exploitation of the seabed, it said.The legal status of the “waste stream” helium would likely be the focus of any legal dispute. East Timor’s lawyers are considering where to file the claim and if it should be against the Australian government or the companies.ConocoPhillips, which extracts and processes the liquified natural gas in Darwin before selling the raw helium to Linde, said the treaty between Australia and East Timor “sets out the arrangements between the countries”. It said contractors operate under “a production-sharing contract and such other agreements that may be negotiated, as necessary,” but declined to give details.Global demand for helium is on the rise and supplies are shrinking, resulting in price hikes, according to a report by the US government think-tank, the National Research Council. It said that between 1995 and 2012 demand will have nearly doubled.The helium industry is worth tens of billions of dollars, due to use in medical, technological and defence research. It is commonly used for MRI scans, welding, LCDs and fibre optics.Dan Baciu, the head of helium business development at Linde, said that East Timor’s move “comes as a surprise”. Linde was not aware of the deal between East Timor and Australia, he said.Additional reporting by Peter Smith in Sydney
364;COP;Conocophillips;2010-05-12T18:38:58Z;Shell’s Alaska plans at risk after oil spill;;Royal Dutch Shell’s $3bn (£2bn) investment in looking for oil in Alaska is at risk after the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.After four years grappling with more than 10 lawsuits to stop or restrict the drilling, on April 1 the Anglo-Dutch oil group received the final air-quality permit required to start drilling in July. While the permit is being appealed against, Shell still expected the process to move forward.But the April 20 explosion on the BP-contracted rig in the Gulf of Mexico and subsequent oil leak has led the Obama administration to ask Shell to explain by May 18 how it would modify its plans to ensure against such an incident in Alaska.The US administration is under pressure from environmentalists to delay the drilling plans of Shell, the largest leaseholder in offshore Alaska.Ken Salazar, US secretary of the interior, said more would be known about any changes to drilling plans in Alaska “in the days ahead”.ConocoPhillips is the other company preparing to drill in Alaska, but it does not plan to do so until 2012.“There is just so much at risk in the Arctic,” said Marilyn Heiman, US arctic programme director for the Pew Environment Group, which has joined with Audubon Alaska, Oceana, and Ocean Conservancy in asking for a moratorium.“It would be irresponsible for the administration to approve exploration drilling this summer in the Arctic Ocean, given the serious concerns raised by BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil explosion and spill in the Gulf of Mexico,” Ms Heiman said.“Winds can exceed 33 knots and there can be 20ft seas in the Arctic Ocean in the summer,” she added. “They halted clean-up in the Gulf last week at 8ft seas.”Yet Pete Slaiby, Shell’s vice-president for Alaska, said Shell’s drilling plans for the Arctic have been scrutinised by not only regulators but the courts since it returned to the area in 2005 to begin acquiring leases in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.“We have looked through this proposal from top to bottom,” he said. He declined to say what tweaks might be made to the proposal by May 18, but did acknowledge: “I’m sure there is going to be some learning from this incident.”Nonetheless, he said Shell’s experience in Alaska dates back to the 1960s, when it began drilling in the Cook Inlet. Of the 30 wells drilled off Alaska, Shell drilled 12 of them and partnered in seven without incident. “We were the ones who pioneered offshore drilling in Alaska,” Mr Slaiby said.He acknowledged there were always risks, likening it to flying in an aircraft in spite of the occasional accident. But Mr Slaiby said the wells Shell is proposing to drill in Alaska are simpler than anything it has done in the deepwater Gulf. They are in 150ft of water, compared with 5,000ft in the Gulf. The pressures are about 5,000 pounds a square inch, versus 15,000 psi in the Gulf.Shell could easily stop a flowing well under these circumstances, he said, noting even if it lost its riser and blow-out preventer, Shell’s well would not flow because of the weight of its drilling mud and the relatively benign pressures.“These wells do not have the mechanical complexity of a deepwater well,” Mr Slaiby said. While there is ice, he added, Shell has much experience with that in Alaska, as well as the North Sea and Canada.“It’s important for us to get in there and demonstrate that we can do it safely,” he said.
365;COP;Conocophillips;2010-05-11T15:59:51Z;All eyes on Australia’s mining tax debate;;Canberra threw a grenade into the heart of Australia’s profitable mining sector this month with its plans for a new 40 per cent tax on “super” profits generated by all resource companies operating on the country’s soil. Uproar in the mining industry ensued.Canberra said the tax, slated to start in two years, would apply to all commodities and cover existing and new projects. Estimated proceeds of A$9bn ($8.1bn) a year from 2013-14 would be used to fund a cut in the company tax rate from 30 to 28 per cent, higher pensions and infrastructure spending.Not a day has passed since the announcement without a fresh attack on Canberra from the industry. A high-profile campaign has been waged to destroy the resource super profits tax, with Canberra accused of killing the golden goose that has supercharged Australia’s economic growth streak, of economic vandalism, and of resource industry nationalisation.The tax will hit Australia’s domestic resources sector but also affect international miners such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Peabody Energy. It will have an impact on energy groups such as the UK’s BG Group, Petronas of Malaysia, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips of the US and PetroChina that are preparing to invest tens of billions of dollars in Queensland’s putative liquefied natural gas sector.The big fear is that if Australia – a country known for its stable fiscal regime – adopts such a tax, others will follow suit.Opponents say the tax proposals should not apply retrospectively. They say the definition of “super” profits – anything above the 10-year Australian government bond rate of about 6 per cent – is too onerous and it will drive investment and capital away to lower-tax countries.Canberra has also been accused of misleading the public by understating the amount of tax the mining sector has paid over the past decade. Meanwhile mining executives have been attacked by the government for “inflammatory rhetoric” that linked the tax to “despotic regimes and communism”.Rio last week had to deny a front page story that it had shelved A$11bn of investment plans, while a mining entrepreneur was caught out after he threatened to scrap a resource project that did not exist.Vitriolic comments have also come from Andrew Forrest, the Australian billionaire chief of Fortescue Metals Group and friend of prime minister Kevin Rudd, who accused the government of lying.BHP has chosen a more considered line. Marius Kloppers, BHP’s chief executive, admitted at the weekend he was not against the new tax in principle but as it stood, it would threaten Australia’s reputation as a stable fiscal regime.“This country has had great wealth generated by investment in this sector, principally because it’s been a stable environment …don’t go back on investments that have already been made,” said Mr Kloppers. Commodities should be treated differently, he added. “The reality is the investment patterns, the return patterns for bauxite, nickel, coal, diamonds and so on [are] all very different and our proposal has always been that each one of those should have its own [tax] rate.”According to Mick Davis, chief of Xstrata, the group’s Australian operations had generated revenues of A$44bn since 2002, but the miner had spent A$45bn in Australia on mining investment, royalties to state governments and taxes.“The proposed tax will significantly impair the cash flows available to sustain our operations and has introduced great investment uncertainty.”David Buckingham, former head of the Minerals Council of Australia, has attacked some of the mining industry’s claims. “The threats to withdraw investment, to withdraw jobs, to withdraw exploration – quite frankly these threats were never true and they are not true now,” Mr Buckingham told Australian radio.The mining groups have run scare campaigns in the past, including during the 1980s when there was a fierce backlash against a 40 per cent tax imposed on offshore petroleum projects.Canberra’s central argument is that Australia’s non-renewable resources are owned by the nation’s population and they deserve a bigger share of the spoils.Observers say that the mining groups’ best hopes are that Mr Rudd’s government is either thrown from office when elections are held this year, or, if the government survives, that it fails to have the numbers in Australia’s upper house Senate to have its tax legislation passed into law.
366;COP;Conocophillips;2010-05-03T17:46:18Z;Fishing industry comes second to clean-up;;The 25,000 residents of Plaquemines parish depend for their livelihoods on either the fish or the offshore oil – and more often than not on both.Manuel Ancar is a contractor for oil company ConocoPhillips building roads at its refinery on a narrow finger of the Mississippi Delta that stretches some 110km southeast of New Orleans.“I also fish in back of Port Sulphur – shrimp, oysters, fish and crab,” he says.That business is now under threat as BP, the Coast Guard, the National Guard and a string of federal agencies fight to tackle an uncontrolled leak from a burst oil well 65km out to sea.So far a combination of the prevailing winds and currents and the miles of booms strung out beyond the delta marshlands have kept the expanding lake of crude at bay. BP has taken responsibility for the crisis and for the clean-up.However, just the threat of contamination has prompted local officials to suspend freshwater fishing, while out at sea federal authorities have banned commercial and game fisherman for the next 10 days from a vast swathe of the Gulf of Mexico stretching from the Delta to the Florida panhandle.The temptation could be to blame big oil, which dominates the economy of the fragile Plaquemines peninsula. The lower delta is a narrow strip of marshes, levees, and streams that bubble to the level of the single southbound road. Bordering it are refineries, holding tanks, gas plants, mobile homes, the occasional pre-Civil War plantation, dollar stores and crawfish shacks.But even with the area now under threat, locals appear in no hurry to blame an industry that supplies myriad jobs. Most of the offshore rig crews come from out of state – seven days on, seven off – but in Port Sulphur and all the way down to Venice in the south, there are the roadside shops of chandlers, welders, contractors and repairmen whose incomes depend on the offshore oil.Port Sulphur, as its name suggests began at the turn of the 20th century as a company town. Venice, the furthest town on the paved road south was built by oil and its ancillary industries, its streets bearing names like Haliburton Road. Even the fishing boat captains at the town’s marina acknowledged the oil came first, the town’s fishing business second.The flat horizon is broken by the funnels and hulls of ships navigating the delta that stands on one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, moving oil from offshore rigs up the Mississippi.Mr Ancar is philosophical. His fishing business is threatened, but if the worst comes to the worst: “I’m going put my boat to work cleaning up the marshes.”The dockside value of Louisiana’s commercial seafood catch is more than $300m a year but the potential loss of revenue from sports fishing is many times greater. Game fisherman who visit the Gulf spend $1.5bn a year in Louisiana alone, which translates into $500m of income and 20,000 jobs statewide.But, with the likely impact of the so-far uncapped well, game fisherman have already cancelled their plans to make it down for the start of the six-week season in early June.On the commercial side, the inland freshwater shrimp and oyster season was opened a week early last week to try to beat the pollution threat but, after a cold spring, both species were small.At the weekend, Chris Slavich’s family moved their shrimp and oysters boats from east of the river where fishing is banned. The west could also be out of bounds if the pollution threat increases. But he does not blame the oil industry. “It was a freak accident after all.”Kevin Bartholomew was not so sure. “All accidents are preventable, so someone must have done it,” he said as he ended his shift at the local waterworks. Mr Bartholomew was on duty throughout Hurricane Katrina which in 2005 devastated the delta.Things were only now getting back to normal, he said, although many people who left to escape the hurricane had not returned.
367;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Abu Dhabi awards Shah gas contracts;;Abu Dhabi’s state-owned oil company on Sunday said it had awarded $5.6bn worth of contracts as it seeks to move ahead with the development of a major sour gas field, days after ConocoPhillips pulled out of a joint venture to develop the project.Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) said that it had awarded Saipem of Italy three contracts worth a total of around $3.1bn for a gas processing plant, sulphur recovery and product pipelines, while South Korea’s Samsung Engineering won a $1.5bn contract for the utilities and offsite package.Adnoc awarded a $463m gas gathering package to a consortium of Spain’s Tecnicas Reunidas and Punj Lloyd of India.The development of Shah, a sour gas field, is deemed critical to Abu Dhabi’s energy strategy as it faces soaring domestic energy demand. The project has already faced delays and is considered a highly challenging project because the gas has a high content of hydrogen sulphide.The decision by ConocoPhillips to pull out of a joint venture last week was seen as continuation of the US oil giant’s move to withdraw from projects as part of a restructuring aimed at shoring up its balance sheet.The cost of developing the Shah field has been estimated at around $10bn.Abu Dhabi is the wealthy capital of the United Arab Emirates and home to more than 90 per cent of the UAE’s oil and gas reserves.It had been hoped that Shah would start producing gas around 2013, with a production target for sales gas of between 500m and 700m cubic feet per day.
368;COP;Conocophillips;2010-04-30T00:45:58Z;Greater Sunrise blocked by East Timor;;East Timor has torpedoed plans by an Australian-led consortium to develop the Greater Sunrise gas reserves in the Timor Sea after blocking a proposal to build a floating liquefied natural gas facility.The move escalates conflicts between the small Pacific nation, Australia and international energy groups on how best to develop oil and gas reserves worth tens of billions of dollars. Woodside Petroleum , the Australian energy group that is the operator of the Sunrise project, said on Thursday it had reached agreement with its partners to build the floating LNG facility.By rejecting Woodside’s proposal, East Timor has blocked plans to develop Sunrise as the governments of Australia and East Timor must give their blessing to the project under a treaty the states signed in 2006.Greater Sunrise is estimated to hold 5,130bn cu ft of natural gas and nearly 226m barrels of oil condensate. Woodside has a 33.4 per cent stake in Sunrise, with ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Japan’s Osaka Gas owning the remainder.East Timor said it would not accept or endorse the floating LNG concept “now or in the future”.“The nation is firmly committed to building an onshore petroleum industry, inclusive of a pipeline to Timor-Leste [East Timor] from the Greater Sunrise field. Timor-Leste will not approve any development of Greater Sunrise that does not include a pipeline to Timor-Leste,” Agio Pereira, secretary of state, said.The Sunrise developers rejected an East Timor facility because the path to the coastline is marred by a 3.3km deep trench in the seabed that poses a significant challenge to building a pipeline.East Timor said Woodside had made its preference public before appropriate consultation with the “resource owners”.“Woodside was acutely aware of the government’s position before today’s announcement …This is not only a source of great concern, but reflects an unacceptable level of arrogance. The approach has significantly compromised future relations with the government,” it said.However, Don Voelte, Woodside chief executive, said the agreement between the nations stipulated that Sunrise must be developed on the basis of “best commercial advantage consistent with good oilfield practice”.He said after an extensive commercial and technical evaluation of the options, including building onshore processing plants at either Darwin or East Timor, a floating LNG processing facility had best satisfied the project’s development needs.
369;COP;Conocophillips;2010-04-28T13:28:18Z;Conoco pulls out of Abu Dhabi gas project;;ConocoPhillips is pulling out of a multibillion dollar joint venture to develop a gas field in Abu Dhabi as part of a restructuring aimed at shoring up its balance sheet.The withdrawal is a significant setback for Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as the Shah onshore gas field is critical to its plans to meet soaring energy demand.“The Shah gas field will be a world-class project that will develop a key resource for Abu Dhabi and the region, and it was a difficult decision not to participate in a project of this importance,” said Ryan Lance, Conoco senior vice-president.Conoco started to restructure after investors began pulling back from the company at the start of 2009, when it announced a $34bn writedown on the reduction in the value of its assets due to falling commodity prices. It also announced 1,300 job cuts and said it would end its strategy of acquisitions.Conoco has since begun to pull out of planned projects. Last week, Conoco said it was withdrawing from a project to build a 400,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Saudi Arabia with Saudi Aramco, the kingdom’s state oil company.The US company signed an agreement to develop the Shah field in 2008, beating competition from Royal Dutch Shell and Occidental Petroleum. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company held a 60 per cent stake in the joint venture, with Conoco the remaining 40 per cent. It has been estimated the project would cost about $10bn.The emirate, which is home to more than 90 per cent of the UAE’s oil and gas reserves, is expected to keep the project alive because of its importance to its energy strategy. But it will now have to decide whether to develop it alone or look for another international partner.Shah, a so-called sour gas field, is seen as an important test of the emirate’s ability to develop its gas resources, much of which has a high content of hydrogen sulphide. This makes it highly corrosive, as well as expensive and technically challenging to develop.The project has already suffered delays, but it was hoped that Shah would start production in 2013, with a target for sales gas of between 500m and 700m cubic feet per day.At the beginning of 2007, the UAE had proven gas reserves of 214,000bn cu ft, the world’s fifth largest. But, as with other nations in the oil-rich Gulf, the UAE faces gas shortages as its population grows and its emirates embark on highly ambitious development plans. The UAE is already a net importer of gas, importing 2bn cu ft per day from Qatar.
370;COP;Conocophillips;2010-04-20T22:13:39Z;Rare glimpse as Trafigura debuts;;The capital markets debut by Trafigura, one of the world’s largest oil and metals traders, has allowed a rare look at the world of the profitable, and traditionally publicity-shy, Swiss-based trading houses.The company for the first time disclosed financial details about itself, such as profitability and shareholder structure, and also told its bondholders in a 111-page long “information memorandum” and investor presentation, about its views on the commodities trading sector’s future and competition trends.The picture that emerges is of an extremely profitable sector, with trading houses riding on the back of volatile commodities prices and facing little competition from new players.In spite of surging demand for raw materials over the past decade from emerging markets such as China and rising prices of anything from oil to copper, Trafigura says that competition has “decreased over the recent years” for the Swiss trading houses. This is due the disappearance of medium-sized commodities trading companies and to merger activity which has formed big companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, resulting in greatly reduced oil trading activity by the combined companies.Trafigura and its peers are also benefiting from companies “moving away from integrated models”, which is accentuating the traders’ role. For example, some steelmakers formerly owned iron ore mines to feed their blast furnaces, but today rely on miners and traders for their raw materials procurement.On top of this, industrial consumers such as chemical companies and car manufacturers now hold less inventory. This in turn, “generates volatility due to the lack of elasticity of the supply chain” which also benefits the trading houses.During the recent financial crisis, competition in the commodities market place has fallen further, Trafigura says, due to “reduced levels of liquidity forcing smaller companies to either trade smaller volumes or exit the market altogether” and “the bankruptcy of certain physical traders such as SemGroup and Projector.”Trafigura told bondholders in the documents that banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the two largest commodity dealers on Wall Street, had their activities in raw materials last year due to the financial crisis.Trafigura told investors it had been profitable every year since it was formed in 1993 and made nearly $1bn in profits in 2009, almost double those of 2008.It was founded by Claude Dauphin, Eric de Turckheim and Graham Sharp, former senior commodities traders at Marc Rich + Co, the well-known trader which, after a management buy-out, transformed itself into Glencore.Glencore, now the word’s largest trading house, made $2.7bn in 2009 in spite of lacklustre results from its mining assets. Industry insiders believe that the world’s five largest oil traders made record profits.Industry executives caution that 2009 was an exceptional year for most traders due to unprecedented trading opportunities in crude and oil products.But Trafigura believes that the trading houses will continue to benefit from increased levels of volatility commodity prices over the last few years, which are expected to continue. Usually, traders take little or no risk when betting on the direction of raw materials prices, but exploit what Trafigura calls “natural, low risk physical arbitrage opportunities”.These include seasonal shortages of petrol in the US, region scarcity of raw materials due to a strike in a large mine, or price differentials over time due to the perception of future supply and demand balances.“Unlike the derivatives markets where transactions – and arbitrage – are closed within seconds, physical arbitrage of this kind requires actual delivery of the physical commodity,” Trafigura said.
371;COP;Conocophillips;2010-04-15T21:44:37Z;If only Uniq’s pension problem was one of a kind;;"Uniq is all bread and almost no filling. The group, which counts Marks and Spencer among customers for its sandwiches, has a market capitalisation of £25m ($39m), but a pension scheme deficit (admittedly on a conservative basis) of more than £400m. It has 2,200 or so staff but 21,000 pension scheme members.If it does not address its deficit, Uniq’s chilled food fridges could be switched off forever and everything – company and pension scheme – will spoil.Why does the plight of this small company matter? Because the innovative recovery plan that Uniq has agreed with its pension trustee needs regulatory approval and the regulator, as always, needs to be wary of setting a dangerous precedent.Uniq has few options. It wants to stop contributions until 2013 and raise money from shareholders to expand, rather than having to plough those funds into making good the scheme deficit. From 2013, the scheme would receive a proportion of earnings from currently-owned businesses, but not from the new acquisitions.Normally, you would expect the trustee (or the regulator) to demand a quid pro quo for such a mean-sounding plan. How about a higher place for the scheme in the hierarchy of creditors? Alas, the pension fund is already Uniq’s biggest unsecured creditor, with few ahead of it in the queue if the group goes belly-up. Promise assets to the scheme in the event of insolvency? Not an option, as Uniq has few assets to promise. About the only possibility may be for the watchdog to ask Uniq to set aside a slice of the new businesses’ profits for the hungry scheme.If Uniq were true to its name and really one of a kind, the regulator could afford to be more lenient. But less scrupulous companies in a pension hole are looking for any hint not to feed their schemes. So the regulator can’t just rubber-stamp a recovery plan that could take 50 years to come good. It’s hard enough to predict that far ahead whether M&S or even sandwiches will still be around – let alone poor, beleaguered Uniq.Messy business at BPShareholders are revolting. At annual meetings from Tokyo to New York investors are raising their voices to agitate for change. In Britain, remuneration topped last year’s agenda; this year feisty investors are taking it upon themselves to dictate strategy.Thursday’s BP AGM saw a clutch of shareholders vote against the company’s plans to invest in Canada’s oil sands. Oil squeezed from the sands is a sticky, tarry mess that necessitates carbon-intensive extraction techniques. It’s more expensive to produce and more taxing on the environment. Hence the angst among investors, including Calpers and Calstrs, the California state pension funds, as well as Co-operative Asset Management and the Unison union’s pension fund from the UK. The resolution, which won the backing of 6 per cent of shareholders, was far from enough to block BP’s Canadian foray. But it does draw attention to a tarry smear on BP’s hardly unblemished record.Environmentalists and other lobby groups have long corralled protest votes at US AGMs. Three things have now changed: these voters are more mainstream, as evidenced by the involvement of Calpers and Tory hopeful/former non-dom Zac Goldsmith; they’re more co-ordinated (AGMs at Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil will get the same treatment over the next month or so); and they’re over here. Issues such as climate change and human rights go beyond the boardroom, making it easier for protestors to win hearts and minds, say through newspaper campaigns, and effect change. This is essentially why none of the international oil majors now operate in Sudan (and why the Chinese moved swiftly in). BP, and the rest of UK plc, had better get used to it.Icesave: the small printWelcome to Icesave’s high-interest savings accounts, which enjoy protection from the Tryggingarsjódur, Iceland’s deposit guarantee scheme, under the supervision of the Fjármálaeftirlitio, the financial regulator. In the unlikely event of disagreement on compensation, however, the Eyjafjallajökull may be asked to intervene. This intervention may take the form of a powerful eruption, blasting volcanic ash 11km into the atmosphere, closing UK airports and disrupting travel plans. This will serve as a reminder to British savers that sky-high interest rates offered by foreign banks can contain invisible dangers that will bring the imprudent and the greedy abruptly down to earth.

372;COP;Conocophillips;2010-04-13T21:01:47Z;Wall St shrugs off Alcoa to close higher;;US stock prices closed higher on Tuesday as the market shrugged off Monday’s disappointing results from Alcoa, as well as the worse-than-expected trade deficit figures, and looked forward to a positive earnings season.The US trade gap increased to $39.7bn in February from $37bn in January as imports grew faster than exports.Small business owners in the US are less confident about the recovery, according to the small business optimist index from the National Federation of Independent Business, which fell 1.3 points to 88. It has been below 90 for 17 successive months. The index is calibrated from the 1986 level, which was given a value of 100.About 34 per cent of small business owners surveyed said weak sales were their biggest commercial problem.After the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,197.30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 11,019.42 but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent lower at 2,465.99.Alcoa, the US’s biggest aluminium producer, fell 1.6 per cent to $14.34 after it posted revenues for the first quarter that missed average expectations on Monday.It is the first company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to report its quarterly results and therefore a closely watched indicator of industrial earnings.“Alcoa’s disappointing sales result was poorly received by markets,” wrote Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank in a client note.The stock was downgraded at UBS to “neutral” from “buy”, and its target price cut to $16 from $17.Smartphone maker Palm pulled back 14.6 per cent to $5.16 on fears that the recent rally in the stock may be overdone. There were also reports that Palm had contacted China’s Huawei Technologies for preliminary acquisition talks.Regional banks were some of the biggest fallers in the S&P 500 index following a downgrade of several key stocks at UBS, which cited “additional headwinds” to the recovery in earnings. Mid-size bank stocks have been the second-fastest growing sub-sector of S&P 500 in 2010.“We continue to believe the pace of earnings recovery will fall well short of expectations,” wrote the analysts in a client note. “We think the recent rally and ensuing valuations are unsustainable, and the [sector] is poised for a meaningful pullback.”Huntington Bancshares led the sector lower, falling 5.7 per cent to $5.69 following UBS’s downgrade to “sell” from neutral. Keycorp, Regions Financial and TCF Financial were lowered to a “sell” from neutral, sending their prices down 2.4 per cent to $8.14, 4.6 per cent to $8.34 and 4 per cent to $16.31 respectively. Commerce Bancshares slipped 3 per cent to $40.80 as the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “buy”.ConocoPhillips, the oil producer, was down 0.5 per cent to $55.67, even as China’s Sinopec said it would pay $4.65bn for ConocoPhillips’ nine per cent stake in oil-sands producer Syncrude Canada.The price is higher than many analysts had expected.Chipmaker Intel rallied 1 per cent to $22.77 ahead of its earnings announcement after the session’s close.Petrohawk Energyjumped 2.5 per cent to $23.18 as the oil and gas explorer agreed to sell half of its stake in the Haynesville midstream operations to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, a pipeline operator, for $875m.Avon Products, a direct seller of cosmetics, dived 8 per cent to $31.99 following reports that the company had suspended four executives in relation to bribery allegations at its China unit pending an internal investigation.DeVry, an operator of for-profit further eduction colleges, was one of the top performers in the S&P 500 index as the stock was raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at Credit Suisse, sending its shares 10.3 per cent higher to $71.73.Oil services stocks were hurt by the falling oil price. BJ Services fell 1.1 per cent to $21.96, Schlumberger was 1.2 per cent lower to $65.51 and Baker Hughes fell 1.3 per cent to $48.21.Do-it-yourself retailer Lowe’s was up 2.4 per cent to $26.22 as the company priced a note offering to raise $1bn in debt.Rival Home Depot was also higher, up 2.6 per cent to $34.34.
373;COP;Conocophillips;2010-04-12T23:29:26Z;Sinopec buys Conoco’s 9% stake in Syncrude;;ConocoPhillips, the third biggest US oil company, said on Monday it had agreed to sell its 9.03 per cent stake in Syncrude, the oil sands project in Canada, to Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production for $4.65bn.Conoco has been marketing the stake in one of the world’s biggest oil sands mining and synthetic crude processing sites since it unveiled in October plans to sell $10bn in assets over the next two years to pay down debt.“This is an important step in the $10bn divestiture program which we announced in October, and we are pleased that Sinopec has recognised the value of this quality asset,” said Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chairman and chief executive.Sinopec’s purchase brings total Chinese investment in Canada’s oil sands region in the province of Alberta to about C$10bn (US$10bn).The deal is important for Sinopec, which is among the state-owned companies that have been looking for ways to flex financial muscle overseas, competing for assets that have been coming on to the market through the string of restructurings brought about by the economic downturn.Sinopec is already an equal partner with France’s Total in the Northern Lights project, after boosting its stake from 40 per cent to 50 per cent last year.PetroChina agreed to pay C$1.9bn last year for a majority stake in two oil sands projects in northern Alberta. The two projects, known as Mackay River and Dover, are being developed by Athabasca Oil Sands, a Calgary-based group that went public earlier this month.China Investment Corporation has bought 17 per cent of Teck Resources, the Vancouver-based metals producer that has a minority interest in the Fort Hills oil sands project.The Syncrude stake sale is the second big deal announced by Conoco in a matter of weeks. In March the group said it would halve its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil , Russia’s second-biggest oil producer, which at current prices could raise up to $4.9bn.Conoco’s restructuring emerged after investors began pulling back from the company at the start of 2009, when it announced a $34bn writedown on the reduction in the value of its assets due to falling commodity prices. At the time, it announced 1,300 job cuts and said it would end its strategy of acquisitions.Conoco said the asset sales were part of its plan to create value for shareholders through a continued focus on disciplined capital investment, a strengthened financial position, improved returns on capital and growth in shareholder distributions.The transaction with Sinopec is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to approval from the Canadian and Chinese governments. Conoco was advised by Credit Suisse. Sinopec was advised by Deutsche Bank.
374;COP;Conocophillips;2010-03-24T20:32:57Z;Weak housing figures damp US sentiment;standardise;"Mounting worries about the European sovereign debt situation curbed risk appetite, sending Wall Street stocks lower on Wednesday, with negative economic data also weighing on sentiment.New orders for durable goods in the US in February rose 0.5 per cent but missed analysts’ consensus projections for a 1 per cent gain.Sales of new homes in the US dropped for the fourth straight month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 308,000 – the lowest since records begun in 1963.“Housing is the weakest link in the recovery story,” said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of Gamco’s global growth fund. “Real estate makes up about 50 per cent of bank assets. A lot of these mortgages are going delinquent. It’s one area I find troubling, which is why we have a low exposure to financial stocks.”However, Mr Ward regards the broader economic recovery as “very resilient”.At the close, the S&P 500 was down .06 per cent to 1,167.72, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.5 per cent to 10,836.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,398.76.One bright sport for the US housing market was Lennar Corp, the third-
largest US housebuilder by revenue, which rallied 3.7 per cent to $17.69 after reporting better quarterly earnings than were expected. Its loss was significantly lower than expected at 4 cents a share versus consensus analyst expectations of a 30 cents a share loss and better than its 98 cents a share loss last year.Gross margins surged to 19.2 per cent from 6.5 per cent a year earlier as the company cut incentives for potential buyers.“Virtually every metric outperformed our expectation,” wrote Stephen East, analyst at Ticonderoga in a client note. “No matter how one cuts it, this was a strong report.”Adobe Systems was one of the session’s biggest risers, advancing 3.7 per cent to $36.51 as the world’s leading graphic design maker forecast significantly stronger second-quarter sales than analysts were expecting.The company said it would launch a new version of its most profitable software – Creative Suite, which comprises design software such as Photoshop – on April 12.Market analysts expect Adobe profit from pent-up demand for the product as many customers avoided upgrading to the current version during the recession.Two tech stocks staged successful debuts, raising hopes for the still struggling initial public offerings market. MaxLinear, a maker of broadband chips, rallied 33.6 per cent above its initial listing price to $18.70 while Calix Networks, a telecoms equipment company, surged 16.2 per cent to $15.10.The oil and gas sector was broadly lower as the price of crude oil fell. Chevron lost 1.1 per cent to $73.93 while ExxonMobil retreated 0.7 per cent to $66.50.ConocoPhillips, the third- largest US oil company by market share, bucked the trend to close flat at $52.53 as the company announced plans to sell half of its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, in the next two years.Coal and natural gas producer Consol Energy added 1.9 per cent to $45.70 as the stock was upgraded from “neutral” to “overweight” by John Bridges, an analyst at JPMorgan, with a nine-month target price of $53 a share.AK Steel gained 0.7 per cent to $23.33 after the steelmaker said it would record a non-cash charge of about $31m resulting from the US healthcare reform legislation. It is one of the first companies to take such a step following the passage of the bill on Sunday.MF Global rose 10.4 per cent to $8.08 as Jon Corzine, former New Jersey governor who ran Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, was appointed chief executive of the New York-based futures and options broker.General Mills slipped 1.9 per cent to $72.18 despite the food conglomerate posting solid quarterly earnings, aided by new product sales, a focus on cost-cutting and lower input costs.Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee shop chain, fell 0.5 per cent to $25.29 after announcing a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share, its first since going public in 1992."
375;COP;Conocophillips;2010-03-24T15:21:50Z;ConocoPhillips / Lukoil;US group to halve its stake in the Russian oil company;"Just as Moscow attempts to woo foreign investors back to Russia, news that ConocoPhillips is going the other way – halving its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil – is badly-timed. After all, this was the most successful partnership between US and Russian energy groups – indeed, one of the largest US ventures into Russia. More importantly, unlike the uneasy, 50-50 relationship between Russian and UK partners in TNK-BP, it was seen as an example of how such investments should work in the more nationalistic economic model that evolved under Vladimir Putin. A Russian partner dominated; the foreign partner took a minority, stumping up capital and western knowhow.But things have changed since Conoco took its initial 7.6 per cent stake in 2004. Then, privately-owned Lukoil was the leading Russian oil player. The balance has now shifted decisively towards state-controlled giants: Rosneft absorbed most of the assets of Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s Yukos, and Gazprom bought Sibneft from the more compliant oligarch Roman Abramovich. Lukoil has not had much of a look-in in the bidding for new licences. The fruits of the US-Russian tie-up amount largely to one joint production unit in the Russian Arctic.Conoco, meanwhile, wants to raise $10bn to reduce debt and improve its returns; the Lukoil stake is a valuable and relatively liquid asset. And, with its 20 per cent stake worth almost $10bn, it is sitting on a paper profit on the $7.5bn it paid. For Lukoil, Conoco’s presence on the shareholder register has sometimes been seen as an insurance policy against Kremlin meddling. But Renaissance Capital suggests Lukoil’s chances of getting hold of strategic assets will be improved by reducing its foreign ties. Unfortunately, that sends a message that is rather the opposite of the one the Russian government has recently been trying to get out.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyConocoPhillips has told Lukoil it intends to halve its 20 per cent stake in the company, Russia’s second-biggest oil producer said.The cut, which, at current prices, could raise up to $4.9bn for the third biggest US oil group, would deal a blow to the biggest and most successful partnership between a Russian and US energy major to date.Vagit Alekperov, Lukoil chief executive, said on Tuesday that Conoco had told the company of its plans to sell the 10 per cent stake in small portions but added that Lukoil saw no reason to use its pre-emptive rights to buy the stake.Conoco is already seeking to raise $10bn in cash to pay off debts."
376;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;ConocoPhillips confirms halving Lukoil stake;;ConocoPhillips, the third biggest US oil company, on Wednesday confirmed plans to halve its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer, raising the amount they expect to generate from asset sales to $15bn from $10bn.Though Lukoil had revealed the plans a day earlier, Conoco had declined to confirm them.Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, told an analyst meeting in New York that he planned to sell the shares on the open market over 2010 and 2011 to recover about $5bn at recent share price levels, which he would then use to buy Conoco shares.“We think it’s important for us to be in Russia,’’ Mr Mulva said. “But, by selling half its stake Conoco can still have its strategic relationship with Lukoil and maintain its position in that marketplace,” he said.“We are focused on creating and delivering value to our shareholders,’’ Mr Mulva said. “We are taking decisive action to sell assets, reduce debt, build on our record of shareholder distributions, and improve returns while growing production and reserves per share.’’The Lukoil stake sale is an addition to the $10bn asset sale plan outlined by Conoco late last year. It would bring potential proceeds from the sale of assets to $15bn over the two years, instead of the $10 originally planned.Mr Mulva told the company’s annual analyst meeting in New York that Conoco still intends to sell $5bn in assets each in 2010 and 2011.Potential 2010 disposals include the company’s ownership interest in the Syncrude oil sands projects in Canada – among the world’s biggest oil sands mining and synthetic crude processing sites, as well as the Rex Pipeline, 10 per cent of its Lower 48 and western Canada portfolio and its remaining US marketing assets.
377;COP;Conocophillips;2010-03-23T19:52:17Z;Conoco to halve stake in Lukoil;;"ConocoPhillips has told Lukoil it intends to halve its 20 per cent stake in the company, Russia’s second-biggest oil producer said.The cut, which at current prices could raise up to $4.9bn for the third biggest US oil group, would deal a blow to the biggest and most successful partnership between a Russian and US energy major to date.Vagit Alekperov, Lukoil chief executive, said on Tuesday Conoco had told the company of its plans to sell the 10 per cent stake in small portions but added that Lukoil saw no reason to use its pre-emptive rights to buy the stake.Conoco is already seeking to raise $10bn in cash to pay off debts. But its apparent decision could reflect the shift in dominance of Russia’s energy sector towards state-backed companies such as Rosneft and Gazpromneft, the oil arm of Gazprom, the state-controlled gas group.This has left Lukoil by the wayside since Conoco first bought into it in 2004, analysts said.Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Uralsib investment bank in Moscow says: “When they bought into Lukoil it was a time when it was positioned as Russia’s premier oil company.“At the time they expected they would be able to use that relationship to expand further into Russia.“But today the rules of the oil game have changed in Russia; today you are not in it unless you are partnered with a state company”.“The catalyst for the sale comes from their debt position but the reason they are selling is because the competitive position they had with this company when they acquired it no longer exists.”Rosneft emerged as Russia’s foremost oil producer from the state break-up of Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s Yukos, the target of earlier failed efforts by Exxon Mobil and Chevron of the US to gain entry into Russia’s oil sector via tie-ups with a local company.Rosneft, Gazpromneft and Kremlin-friendly Surgutneftegaz are now seen as frontrunners for new licences to develop big new fields, while companies with foreign participation are treated with suspicion by the government, analysts said.Mr Weafer said: “It is no longer justified to have so much funds tied up with Lukoil. A 10 per cent stake gives Conoco the same position as a 20 per cent stake so it makes sense to cut it back and reduce debt”.Constraints on access to new fields are particularly important for Lukoil because production at its existing asset base in Russia is expected to decline, according to Valery Nesterov, oil and gas analyst at Troika Dialog investment bank in Moscow.Even though Lukoil has the largest hydrocarbon reserves in Russia its deposits are expensive to develop and scattered across Russia and abroad, Mr Nesterov said.As the company focuses on efficient production over expansion at all costs, its production is forecast to decline annually by 1 per cent a year in the next few years, he added.Lukoil and Conoco had nevertheless built up a successful alliance since the US firm hooked up with Lukoil in 2004, gradually increasing its stake to 20 per cent and investing hundreds of millions of dollars in a joint venture with Lukoil in the Arctic called Naryanmarneftegaz, which in 2009 reached full capacity production at 7.5m tonnes a year.Analysts had expected Conoco would focus on the sale of other assets to raise cash to boost its balance sheets, such as exploration and production assets in Canada and the continental US, some natural gas assets in the North Sea and US pipelines and terminals.Conoco’s 9 per cent stake in the Syncrude oil sands projects in Canada – among the world’s biggest oil sands mining and synthetic crude processing sites – was among those assets noted up for sale.But Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy, said ultimately Conoco’s Lukoil stake represented a “big, liquid asset that is very valuable.”Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, “is committed to raising a lot of money. This is frankly, the easiest and least disruptive way to do that,” he said.If the stake is sold gradually over three years as expected, the sale might not dent Lukoil’s share price too much, analysts said. Lukoil also had a broad base of US institutional investors such as Blackrock, Fidelity and Baring Asset Management.Conoco declined to confirm the sale."
378;COP;Conocophillips;2010-03-22T02:57:59Z;Arrow backs improved takeover offer;;Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina have won a board recommendation from Arrow Energy after lifting their joint takeover bid for the Australian energy producer from A$4.45 to A$4.70 a share in cash.The revised bid announced early on Monday values Arrow’s Australian assets, chiefly its reserves of coal-bed methane gas in Queensland, at A$3.5bn (£2.1bn) and excludes the Brisbane-based group’s international operations that are worth an estimated A$400m.Arrow is one of a number of groups aiming to invest a combined A$50bn to convert reserves of coal-bed methane into liquefied natural gas. The methane will be extracted by drilling into coal seams before it is piped overland to the coast where it will then be converted into liquefied natural gas and shipped to Asia.Shell, which has pursued Arrow for about two years, is also developing a project in Queensland but it needs Arrow to bulk up its gas reserves. Arrow is among Australia’s largest holders of coal-seam gas acreage.Shell’s partnership with PetroChina is on a 50:50 basis and includes an agreement for the Chinese group to take half of the LNG produced.“Shell and PetroChina bring technical capabilities, capital backing, major project experience and LNG marketing ability,” Shell said.The value put on Arrow’s Queensland operations will also provide a boost to the other consortiums planning to develop similar projects. These include projects from the UK’s BG Group and a joint venture between ConocoPhillips and Australia’s Origin Energy.Malcolm Brinded, Shell’s executive director of upstream international, said the new joint venture would be a growth asset that would help meet rising demand for cleaner energy. “We expect to take the final investment decision on this large LNG project by 2012,” he said.The offer needs to be cleared by Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board, which last year blocked a number of Chinese takeovers, and the National Development and Reform Commission of China and China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange.Arrow shareholders will also receive shares in Dart Energy, a newly listed entity.Arrow is advised by Citigroup and UBS, NM Rothschild is advising Shell and Morgan Stanley is advising PetroChina.
379;COP;Conocophillips;2010-03-16T20:37:34Z;Habeas corporation;Ruling boosts corporations’ legal standing in Third World disputes;Asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton famously explained: “Because that’s where the money is.” American attorneys working on a contingency basis have long embraced similar logic when suing corporations on their clients’ behalf. But even in the hyperlitigious US, companies are able to defend themselves against frivolous claims. That is not always the case in the developing world, which is why multinationals are cheering a recent US legal ruling.Chevron, the oil company, made what legal experts consider a successful pre-emptive strike against the Ecuadorean government, blocking a stay of international arbitration in a $27bn local pollution damage lawsuit originally brought in 1993. In order to encourage foreign investment, thousands of bilateral investment agreements allow for cases to be tried locally but international arbitration becomes more likely if multinationals can demonstrate a denial of justice.Chevron presented overwhelming proof in its case, from political interference to inappropriate expert testimony and even alleged bribery. It is too soon to draw conclusions about how the ruling might affect other companies, but US oil producers ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, which claim their assets were unjustly nationalised in Venezuela, might benefit. It also may make it harder for local parties in joint ventures, often state-owned companies, to be treated better than their deeper-pocketed partners.In the case of Ecuador, the fact that the case against Chevron was championed by Rafael Correa, the leftist president, proved to be a double-edged sword. His influence over the judiciary and subsequent irregularities reinforced Chevron’s claim that it would not receive “fair and equitable treatment”. Some locals will gripe that multinationals are using treaties to place themselves above the law, but the alternative is higher perceived political risk and less investment. Developing countries’ embrace of jackpot justice is one American fad that is going out of style.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
380;COP;Conocophillips;2010-03-12T08:23:01Z;Energy: A foot on the gas;;"Andrew Austin is bringing an American revolution to Britain. On a patch of farmland east of Liverpool, his company Igas has drilled one of Europe’s first wells for “unconventional” gas, extracted from source rocks traditionally rejected by the industry as uneconomic.The former investment banker hopes in the next couple of years to exploit the source that has transformed the outlook for energy in the US: shale rocks.Igas has taken leases on 300,000 acres of shale, a sedimentary rock, across north Wales and north-west England, joining the rush of companies large and small in countries such as Poland and Germany seeking to replicate a boom in the US that has captured the industry’s imagination.“Even a year ago, if I had said I was taking licences in big slabs of shale rock, everybody would have thought I was barking mad,” Mr Austin says. “Now I get invited to five conferences a week.”The rush of European interest in shale underscores wider awareness of a change in the outlook for gas supplies. A surge in US production has meant that within three years the world has gone from running out of natural gas to being drowned in it.The implications are profound. Policymakers have faced a trilemma: how to make energy supplies secure, affordable and clean. Now an abundance of gas appears to provide the answer to all three problems at once. In the words of Tony Hayward, chief executive of BP, it is a “game changer” – certainly for America, and quite possibly for the world.If western politicians get it right, they could transform their uneasy relationships with suppliers in potentially troubling countries such as Russia and Nigeria, while meeting carbon reduction targets without relying on nuclear and wind power, which can deliver electricity only at vastly inflated expense. The consequences will be greatest if Europe can emulate the upsurge in US production. If it does not, the effects will still be profound.However, there are two problems that could prevent gas from being the “long-term energy solution” proclaimed this week by Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, a US oil and gas group.One is political resistance; the other is the danger of pollution that one analyst warns could pose a “Toyota-sized” reputational risk.Scepticism about the gas revolution is understandable because change has come so fast. Until five years ago, US policymakers and energy executives were fretting about securing enough gas to make up for the decline in the country’s own, sizable production. This year, the US has overtaken Russia to become the world’s biggest gas producer for the first time in nearly a decade. Technical breakthroughs that allow companies to tap gas trapped in its vast shale reserves, until recently considered impervious, have allowed it to shut its doors to imports from distant countries. The industry now thinks it can produce from those reserves for 100 years.Furthermore, with technical developments that make it easier to export liquefied natural gas, changes in the US market can have effects thousands of miles away. As America loses its appetite for imports, LNG tankers from countries such as Qatar are re-routed to Asia and Europe.For the latter, the prospect of increased imports of LNG and the potential for its own unconventional gas production offer reprieve from dependence on Gazprom, the Russian gas export monopoly. A recent report by the Wood Mackenzie consultancy concluded that Russia’s share of the European gas market was likely to fall from 29 per cent to 24 per cent this decade because of the competition from gas originating in countries such as Qatar, Nigeria and Algeria.The increased supply of gas, and the more cautious views of the outlook for demand growth after the recession, have also taken the urgency out of projects such as the Nabucco pipeline, the European Union-backed project to bring up to 31bn cubic metres of gas a year from the Caspian region to central Europe. Because Russia has the world’s largest reserves of gas, Europe will still find it difficult to extricate itself from the relationship with its biggest supplier. But exploiting its own unconventional gas reserves could make a big difference to the EU, its eastern members in particular.The especially appealing feature of the new supplies of gas is that they could reinforce energy security at a much lower cost than other home-grown energy sources such as nuclear power or offshore wind.In America, the benchmark price of gas is below $5 per million British thermal units; in Britain, it is about 30p per therm. Those prices are equivalent to about $30 per barrel of oil: less than half today’s crude price of about $80. Prices are so low that it is cheaper to use gas to generate electricity than coal. As the world economy recovers, prices are expected to pick up again. But rising US production is likely to put a ceiling on how far they can rise.Gas is also the preferred fuel for power companies planning to build plants, because gas-fired designs are cheapest and quickest to construct. Combined cycle gas turbines, the most modern and efficient plants, are a proved technology that can be built for less than $1m per megawatt of capacity, compared to perhaps $4m per megawatt for a new nuclear plant and $5m per megawatt for a wind turbine located out at sea. “Gas is a very competitive option,” says Fabien Roques of the IHS CERA consultancy. “Gas-fired plants are very flexible; they can back up renewables; they are very straightforward, and they are very low risk for investors.”When the political commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions is taken into account, the appeal of gas is even stronger.Gas creates about half the carbon dioxide of coal when burned to generate electricity. Indeed, one of the cheapest ways to cut emissions is to shut coal plants and replace them with gas.Lambert Energy, the advisory firm, estimates that shutting down the EU’s coal-fired power stations and replacing them with CCGT plants would cut emissions by about 20 per cent of 1990 levels, meeting the target set by European governments for 2020.In the US, the same shift would cut emissions by 22 per cent from 2005 levels, exceeding the 17 per cent reduction proposed by President Barack Obama at the Copenhagen climate summit last December.If it switched entirely out of coal-fired power and into gas, the EU would need about 40 per cent more gas, but higher LNG imports and some domestic shale gas production could make it possible to meet that increased demand.The vision of a gas-based energy system, cheap, clean and secure, is a seductive one. It will not be easy, however, to turn it into reality.The primary problem is politics, according to Philip Lambert of Lambert Energy. “There is only one thing that can stand between natural gas being the affordable, quick and material answer to the environmental challenge posed by the globalisation of energy use – and that is political unwillingness to accept gas as the fuel of choice.”In part because of concerns about excessive reliance on Russia, EU governments have committed themselves to renewables such as wind power, promising to derive 20 per cent of Europe’s energy from those sources by 2020. As a result, the industry is being pushed away from the lowest-cost options for emissions reduction to higher-cost technologies such as offshore wind.In the US, opposition to an increased use of natural gas comes not only from the politically powerful coal lobby resisting any erosion of its position but also from policymakers and Congress, largely focused on supporting renewables and nuclear power.Policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have been slow to accept that the outlook for gas supplies has been transformed.At the CERA Week industry conference in Houston on Tuesday, Steven Chu, the US energy secretary, spoke positively about shale deposits but highlighted the role of gas as merely “a key enabler of renewable energy”.Günther Oettinger, the new European commissioner for energy, also stresses the value of renewable energy. Welcoming forecasts on Thursday that the EU was on course to meet its renewable goal for 2020, he said: “Our task will be to help all member states not only to reach the 20 per cent target but to go beyond.”That political pressure damages confidence in future demand for gas and risks choking off the investment needed to guarantee supplies. It may also weigh against the construction of new gas-fired power stations because investors will worry about whether the plants will run only when other forms of power, such as wind, are unavailable. “Investors need to work out how gas plants will remain profitable post-2020,” says Mr Roques.The other problem is the potential environmental impact of shale gas production. Water, sand and chemicals are pumped into the ground under pressure, to crack the shale and create gaps so the gas can flow out.In the US, this process of fracturing, or “fracking”, has already caused concern among environmental campaigners and some politicians worried about possible contamination of ground water.Michael Zenker of Barclays Capital, warns: “If fracturing was halted, there would be a serious dent in the supply outlook for North America.”He does not expect environmental concerns to slow the growth of the US industry, although he acknowledges they could be a “reputational” risk.In more densely populated and often environmentally sensitive European countries, however, those worries could be much more of a problem.Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer, chief executive of Austria’s OMV, one of the companies exploring the potential of shale gas in Europe, says: “I don’t want to create these kind of hopes and fantasies that lack final results, so I’m extremely cautious whether [shale gas] will be an option at all.”Alexander Medvedev – the head of Gazprom’s international business, who is watching the effect of shale gas nervously – is counting on environmental concerns to derail ambitions to bring shale gas technology to Europe. If things go his way, then there is a risk that Russia’s grip on European energy could tighten, not ease.While shale gas may fail to take off in Europe, however, the most important revolution could come in China, which relies on coal for 81 per cent of its rapidly growing electricity needs and on gas for only 1 per cent.Beijing is keen to change that balance to reduce carbon and sulphur emissions, which are suffocating its big cities, and also wants to secure more of its fuel supplies at home. Last year the government signed an agreement under which the US government will help China assess its shale gas potential.In the long run, China and the US agreeing that natural gas is the fuel of the future may well prove to be more important than their failure to come up with binding emissions targets at Copenhagen last year."
381;COP;Conocophillips;2010-03-08T20:01:53Z;World leader chooses well-placed partner;;Royal Dutch Shell’s move on Arrow Energy is an important step forward in the company’s development of Australia’s coal bed methane. Equally important is its choice of partner: PetroChina, China’s largest oil and gas group.Shell is a world leader in liquefied natural gas, super-cooled so that it can be transported by tanker, but it has lagged behind its rivals, including BG Group, in plans to use unconventional gas to produce LNG.Unconventional gas lies in reservoirs that can include coal and shale, where more advanced technology is needed to make it commercially viable.Australia has some of the world’s largest reserves of coal bed methane, and a relatively small domestic market. It is also conveniently located to export to the growing LNG markets of Asia, of which China is the most exciting.This opportunity has led to a rush of international investment into the gas-rich state of Queensland in eastern Australia. BG of the UK, ConocoPhillips of the US and Petronas of Malaysia have made acquisitions or set up joint ventures in the region in recent years.It seemed that Shell was being left behind. It has a joint venture with Arrow, and plans a big LNG liquefaction plant at Curtis Island, on the east coast of Queensland. However, it needs regulatory and corporate approvals before it can take a final investment decision on the project.Now Shell has been provoked into action. Arrow plans a smaller LNG plant across the bay from Curtis Island at Fisherman’s Landing, which would take its coal bed methane production for export.Frank Harris, LNG analyst at Wood Mackenzie, believes Shell would rather use the gas to feed its own plant, which would use its own proven technology.“Shell had to take control to make sure Arrow’s resources stayed associated with Shell’s own LNG project,” he said.Arrow has also opened itself up for a bid, because it looks likely to face difficulties developing its gas for export on its own.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch argued in a note last month that the Fisherman’s Landing project still needed “intensive negotiations” to complete LNG sales contracts. They added: “Whilst management has stuck with its 2012 start-up date for first LNG, we remain sceptical given the ever-compressing timeline.”The most important factor for any LNG project is securing buyers. Without that, committing the billions of dollars needed would be too risky.The danger of failing to tie in customers with an equity stake was illustrated at the start of the year, when PetroChina ended its agreement with Woodside Petroleum to buy about A$45bn (US$41bn) worth of LNG over 20 years from its planned Browse LNG project in Western Australia, which is scheduled for final investment decision in 2012.Woodside said last month that it was still talking to PetroChina, but the breakdown of the initial sales agreement signed in 2007 has cast a shadow over the project.Mr Harris said: “Shell’s master-stroke is coming in with PetroChina: the only king-maker left among the gas buyers.”In other coal bed methane LNG developments, BG has brought in CNOOC of China, and Santos of Australia has Petronas.For PetroChina, tying up with Shell gives it a chance to learn from the company with the world’s most extensive LNG experience, as well as acquiring knowledge of producing unconventional gas.Arrow’s shares ended on Monday in line with the value of the Shell/PetroChina offer, suggesting that the approach stands a good chance of success.With so many companies competing in a crowded space, it will not be surprising if there is further consolidation, and the companies that have alliances with strong buyers are likely to come out victors.

383;COP;Conocophillips;2010-03-08T18:18:12Z;Shell and PetroChina offer to buy Arrow;;Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina have moved to take a lead role in Australia’s burgeoning coal-bed methane gas sector after making a joint offer for Arrow Energy that values the Brisbane-based energy producer at A$3.7bn (US$3.4bn).Shares in Arrow jumped 47 per cent on Monday to close at A$5.11 after the group said the oil companies had made an indicative proposal for its Australian operations worth A$4.45 a share in cash, or A$3.3bn.A takeover would be structured so that Arrow’s shareholders would also receive shares in a new entity that would own the Australian group’s international operations, understood to be valued at 55 cents a share or A$400m, lifting the total value of the bid to A$5 a share.The Australian company is at the vanguard of a handful of projects in the state of Queensland that are collectively looking to invest more than A$50bn in a race to convert reserves of coal-bed methane into liquefied natural gas.Energy groups plan to extract methane by drilling into coal seams before it is piped overland to the port of Gladstone where it will be converted into LNG and shipped to Asia.Arrow is Australia’s largest holder of coal-seam gas acreage with interests covering 65,000 square kilometres in Queensland. It has proved, probable and possible reserves of 11,042 petajoules.Arrow hopes to make first shipments to Asia in 2012, possibly ahead of rival projects being developed by the UK’s BG Group, a joint venture between ConocoPhillips and Australia’s Origin Energy, and another between Australia’s Santos and Petronas of Malaysia.Shell has had its sights on Arrow for almost two years. It is thought to have made an unsuccessful bid worth about A$3bn last August.The energy group’s partnership with PetroChina is on a 50:50 basis, and is thought to include an agreement for the Chinese oil group to take half of the LNG produced by the Australian project.PetroChina in Hong Kong confirmed the Chinese group’s bid but declined to elaborate. Shell said it was in talks to buy Arrow, and that those talks excluded the Australian group’s international assets.A bid would need to clear Australia’s foreign investment regulator, which knocked back a number of Chinese bids last year because they failed to pass “national interest” tests.Analysts and investors said the bid looked opportunistic, pointing out that Arrow’s shares had fallen heavily this year on fears a large capital raising would be needed to fund its development.However, New Hope Coal, which owns 15.5 per cent of Arrow, has already flagged that it is reviewing its holding in the Australian group.In 2008, Shellagreed to invest up to A$776m to buy 30 per cent of Arrow’s coal-bed methane acreage and 10 per cent of its international assets.Arrow, which is advised by Citigroup and UBS, said at this stage its board recommended that shareholders take “no action”. NM Rothschild is acting for Shell, while Morgan Stanley is advising PetroChina.
384;COP;Conocophillips;2010-03-07T18:24:17Z;Australia set for lead gas export role;;"The boom in the domestic US shale gas industry comes as Australia is about to secure its path to becoming the world’s biggest exporter of unconventional gas.International oil companies are on the verge of sanctioning a handful of multi-billion dollar projects in the Australian state of Queensland. The projects involve extracting methane from coal beds and turning it into liquid natural gas so that it can be exported by tanker to hungry Asian markets, such as China.The Australian coal bed methane industry has attracted a large group of companies, including BG Group, of the UK; a joint venture between ConocoPhillips of the US and Australia’s Origin Energy; a combination of Australia’s Santos with Petronas of Malaysia. Royal Dutch Shell has also teamed up with local player Arrow Energy.Frank Harris, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, says that Australia is one of the few places that unconventional gas would be used for long-haul export, rather than domestically.“The beauty of Queensland is that it has large reserves of coal bed methane and a domestic market that is too small to compete with export markets.”Western Canada and Indonesia could also become exporters. In Indonesia coal bed methane represents a chance to make up the production shortfalls from ageing conventional gas fields. In fact, BP believes it could ship gas from its fields in the country as liquid natural gas before Australia. But local politics could complicate and delay that ambition, Mr Harris said.Much of the rest of the world’s unconventional gas resources will supply domestic markets. But even the more captive production is having a deep international impact. In the US, domestic production of unconventional gas has removed the need for imports, leaving a glut of gas on the international market. Tony Regan, at Tri-Zen International, a consultancy focused on the oil and gas industry, says Australian producers are suffering. “It is becoming increasingly tough to line up customers because there is a surplus of LNG and customers of these projects will be able to drive hard bargains.”In the longer term the market could get even more crowded if China, which at the moment is big gas importer, follows a similar path to the US. Analysts believe this is a possibility because the country has large coal bed methane and shale reserves and is keen to find a domestic alternative for dirty coal.But a weak market is not Australia’s only challenge. Given the massive outlays, the competing projects need to consolidate and the first signs of that emerged last month when the Conoco/Origin team signed a sales deal with rival BG.The companies must transport the gas hundreds of kilometres from Queensland’s interior overland to the port of Gladstone.Building infrastructure, such as pipelines, to support the many natural resource projects in Australia will test the country’s capacity limits and could curtail some developments."
385;COP;Conocophillips;2010-02-18T01:43:46Z;Energy companies fight own emissions corner;;After making common cause for years, the energy companies campaigning for legislation to curb US greenhouse gas emissions are finding that what divides them may be as important as what unites them.On Tuesday, BP and ConocoPhillips, the oil and gas groups, withdrew from the US Climate Action Partnership, which campaigns for climate legislation.They say they need to make their case for themselves as the debate moves from whether an emissions cap is needed, to how it would be implemented.As the details come into focus, oil and gas companies are being split off from the power generators such as Duke Energy, Exelon and NRG Energy, which remain members of the USCAP. The oil and gas companies say they still want an energy and environment bill to be passed, but do not want just any bill. In particular, they are concentrating on lobbying for legislation promoting natural gas as a way to reduce carbon emissions.Oil companies argue that many of the bills that have come before Congress place an unfair burden on motor fuels and offer too many concessions to coal.The Waxman-Markey bill that passed in the House of Representatives last year, for example, allocates 2 per cent of allowances to fuel producers but makes them responsible for 44 per cent of emissions.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, said last year the proposed legislation could threaten the sustainability of the US refining industry, costing US refiners $100bn (€73bn, £64bn) a year within three years. That would hit an industry under pressure from a drop in demand.On top of that, the industry is upset President Barack Obama’s new budget outlines about $80bn in tax increases on the US oil and gas industry.Jim Mulva, chief executive of Conoco, explained the bills in Congress seek unnecessarily punitive measures on the industry while ignoring the “critical role” natural gas could play in reducing carbon emissions. Natural gas is about 50 per cent less carbon intensive than coal.Larry Nichols, chief executive of Devon Energy and chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s national trade organisation, said: “We do not understand how the Obama administration and Congress can advocate subsidies for nuclear energy, wind and solar while calling for new taxes on natural gas.” Mr Nichols said he was not surprised BP and Conoco left USCAP.Royal Dutch Shell, the last remaining big oil company in the USCAP, shares Conoco Phillips’ concerns but the company will stay in USCAP to “remain engaged”.
386;COP;Conocophillips;2010-02-16T23:37:45Z;BP deals blow to Obama fight on climate;;The Obama administration’s faltering efforts to pass climate change legislation suffered another blow on Tuesday when BP and ConocoPhillips abruptly pulled out of the leading business group lobbying for curbs on US greenhouse gas emissions.By withdrawing from the United States Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), the oil groups, together with Caterpillar, the heavy machinery company, signalled that they would take a more focused approach to the issue by pushing for specific policies that would benefit them, rather than the principle of reducing emissions.“It’s really important that we get climate change legislation…but it’s about what’s in the bill, not just about getting a bill,” Red Cavaney senior vice-president of government affairs at Conoco, said. “We need to spend time addressing the issues that impact our shareholders and consumers.”BP and Conoco on Tuesday said the proposed energy legislation that has stalled in the Congress would impose an unfair burden on the oil industry.“We will continue to work for passage of federal legislation that… is environmentally effective, reduces emissions across the US economy in a measured and affordable way and which treats all energy consumers and producers in a fair and equitable manner,” BP, Europe’s biggest oil company, said. “We don’t believe legislation currently pending in the Congress achieves these objectives.”The two oil majors have been working together to propose a “linked fee” – something between a tax and a full-blown cap-and-trade system for reducing carbon emissions – that they say would provide more predictability for consumers.The House of Representatives has passed a cap-and-trade bill but efforts to get similar legislation through the Senate have ground to a halt as healthcare reform and jobs have taken priority. The Obama administration has instead increasingly turned to regulation to impose limits on carbon emissions.Royal Dutch Shell is now the only large oil company still a member of USCAP, which was founded in 2007 to set out a plan for a limit on greenhouse gases and tradeable emissions permits. The group played down the departures, saying that its membership was constantly changing. Three companies – AES, Alstom and Honeywell – joined in October.Daniel Weiss, a climate change analyst at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think-tank, said the companies’ were now more interested in lobbying for policies that affected them directly.“They are now at the stage where they are interested in cutting deals that benefit their specific companies, rather than supporting the overall architecture,” Mr Weiss said.
387;COP;Conocophillips;2010-02-16T22:16:55Z;US investor focus shifts to earnings;;A succession of mainly solid corporate earnings and the European Union’s seemingly tougher stance towards Greece helped give comfort to traders returning from a three-day weekend on Tuesday, sending Wall Street stocks higher across the board.“Investors seem to be taking the lack of an immediate bail-out for Greece and the decision to give the country time to show whether it has the ability to tackle its budget problems as a sign that risks in Europe may not be as high as had previously been feared,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.The positive mood was further bolstered by a significantly higher-than-expected Empire State general business conditions index figure for February. The index, which acts as a gauge of manufacturing activity in New York state, rose to 24.91 this month from 15.92 in January, boosted by higher inventories. A figure of 17-18 had been expected by analysts.The S&P 500 closed up 1.8 per cent at 1,094.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 per cent to 10,268.81 and the Nasdaq moved 1.4 per cent higher at 2,214.19.Kraft Foods, the US food group that agreed this month to buy UK confectioner Cadbury for £11.7bn, lost 0.4 per cent to $28.97, in spite of reporting a 3.2 per cent rise in revenues in the fourth quarter. The company said it anticipated the integration of Cadbury to hurt its 2010 results.A strong rally in commodities prices, spurred by a weaker dollar against the euro, helped oil and basic metals company shares rise, giving the biggest boost to the S&P 500 index.Chevron the energy company, rose 2.8 per cent to $72.99 helped by a broker upgrade to “outperform” from “market perform” by Sanford C. Bernstein.ExxonMobil was also up 2.3 per cent to $66.28, while ConocoPhillips gained 2.6 per cent to $49.92.Steel producers AK Steel and United States Steel were two of the biggest movers in the S&P 500 index, rising 6.4 per cent to $23.07 and 6.6 per cent to $51.14 respectively. Nucor also moved ahead 3.8 per cent to $42.69 and Commercial Metals Company increased 2.8 per cent to $15.25.The stocks were helped by a report from accountancy firm Ernst & Young forecasting that mergers and acquisitions among miners could more than double this year, breaking a two-year decline, as China and India seek to secure supplies of raw materials.Oshkosh Corp rose 2.8 per cent to $39.42 on news that it had kept hold of a US army contract to build armoured trucks in a deal worth up to $3bn. The commercial and military trucks maker beat rivals BAE Systems and Navistar International.
388;COP;Conocophillips;2010-02-11T21:25:12Z;Total and Statoil struggle to grow;;Total and Statoil, two of Europe’s biggest energy groups, on Thursday revealed they were struggling to increase their production because of weak demand for natural gas and production cuts by Opec, the oil producers’ cartel.Statoil managed to increase output 2 per cent in 2009, bringing production to 1.962m barrels a day, but forecast largely flat production in the range of 1.925m b/d to 1.975m b/d for this year. It cut its expectations for 2012 to between 2.1m b/d and 2.2m b/d from previous guidance of 2.2m b/d.Helge Lund, Statoil’s chief executive, told the Financial Times the company might delay the sale of some gas volumes to maximise profit.“We would like to move gas to periods that give higher value,” he said, adding that he was confident Statoil had a range of projects that would ensure production growth after 2012.But Oswald Clint, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said he suspected weak natural gas prices had forced the company to make costly concessions to buyers and Statoil was struggling to compensate for declines at its older fields.Total, the French energy group, saw its production fall 3 per cent in 2009 to 2.281 m b/d. The company predicted it would return to production growth this year as oil and gas fields started to raise their output last year.Jason Kenney, analyst at ING, who covers both Total and Statoil, was more positive about the French company. “If you are just going to count barrels, you should be looking forward to quite a good time at Total,” he said.He said Total also outshone its peers in return on average capital employed (Roace), which indicates the company’s efficiency.Total’s Roace was 13.2 per cent, similar to BP’s 13.6 per cent, above Chevron’s 11.4 per cent, Statoil’s 10.4 per cent and significantly better than Royal Dutch Shell’s 7.4 per cent. The runaway leader of the pack, however, was ExxonMobil with 20.8 per cent, according to ING.Statoil reported a drop in fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of NKr34.4bn ($5.8bn) compared with NKr43.4bn in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, adjusted earnings was NKr130.7bn compared to NKr203.3bn.Total’s fourth-quarter adjusted net income – the number most watched by analysts which strips out gains from changes in the value of fuel inventories, one-off items and the value of Total’s stake in Sanofi-Aventis – was €2.08bn ($2.86bn), down 28 per cent from the year before.On a per share basis, fourth-quarter adjusted net income fell 28 per cent to €0.93.For the year, Total’s adjusted net income was €7.78bn, or €3.48 per share, compared with €13.92bn in 2008, or €6.20 per share.
389;COP;Conocophillips;2010-02-03T22:12:41Z;Statoil to spin off filling stations division;;Statoil is planning to spin off its international chain of filling stations, reflecting a broader shift by oil and gas producers away from roadside retail operations.The Norwegian energy group’s proposal to hive off its entire 2,300-strong chain in eight countries marked the boldest move yet to leave the retail market, analysts said.Statoil is following an industry trend that has seen many of the world’s biggest integrated oil companies shed retail sites, which represents the lowest margin part of most oil producers’ business.Since 2007, the UK’s BP has sold all its US sites and shed 10,000 jobs in the process. Chevron last month announced plans to restructure its retail and refining division .In the past decade ConocoPhillips has shed 55.4 per cent of its retail sites, ExxonMobil 38.5 per cent and Royal Dutch Shell 29.8 per cent, according to PFC Energy, the consultancy.Statoil said its board had decided to consider a new ownership structure for the unit, with a stock exchange listing the most likely outcome, no sooner than the fourth quarter of this year.“In the future, we believe that this unit’s growth and further development will be best achieved as an independent company with direct access to the capital markets,” said Helge Lund, Statoil chief executive.Analysts said the retail unit was forecast to generate net profits of about Nkr1bn ($171m) this year – a small fraction of the projected Nkr21bn group total – giving the business a potential valuation of NKr9bn to NKr10bn.A separate retail business would be among the biggest companies on the Norwegian stock exchange with a presence across Scandinavia, the Baltic countries, Poland and Russia.Analysts said it was hard for Statoil to justify investment in a business with much lower returns on capital than its core production operations. The unit’s concentration in northern and eastern Europe has also found itself at odds with Statoil’s increasing focus on exploration in the Americas, Africa and the Middle East.“It’s very different to the core oil and gas business to have 1m retail customers in a low-margin business selling not only energy products but also food and drink,” said Trond Omdal, analyst at Arctic Securities in Oslo.The division earmarked for spin-off also includes the business that supplies lubricants, aviation and marine fuels. Statoil, two-thirds owned by the Norwegian government, would keep control of its refinery business, which supplies the retail operation.The group said it would initially remain a “significant owner” of the retail business in the event of a spin-off.
390;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chevron’s net income drops 37%;;Chevron reported on Friday a 37 per cent drop in net income in the fourth quarter, as higher production failed to offset its refining losses.Net profit at the US’s second-biggest oil company’s dropped to $3.1bn, or $1.53 per share, from $4.9bn in the same quarter a year earlier.Its US refining and marketing operations lost $345m in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with earnings of $1.03bn in the year earlier period, on weaker margins on sales of petrol and other refined products.Chevron’s international refining and marketing operations also incurred losses of $268m in the fourth quarter, compared with earnings of $1.05bn before.John Watson, Chevron’s new chief executive, has pledged to restructure the division and cut the size of its workforce.Chevron’s earnings follow a string of results that highlight the impact on the US refining sector of the economic downturn and the move away from fossil fuels.The US refining sector is being hit by lower demand because of the economic downturn and a move away from fossil fuels.Valero, the US’s biggest refiner, reported earlier this week that its full-year net loss widened to $1.98bn, from a net loss of $1.13bn in 2008.The refining and marketing division at ConocoPhillips, the US’s third-biggest oil company, reported a fourth-quarter loss of $215m, swinging from a profit of $289m in the 2008 quarter, and a full-year profit of $37m, plunging from $2.3bn in profit in full-year 2008.Analysts had anticipated the refining losses but have been watching for improvements in Chevron’s exploration and production portfolio, which showed oil-equivalent production of 2.78m barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 238,000 from 2.54m b/d in the 2008 quarter.“Refining was a key weakness and worse, relative to expectations, than peers so far,” said Credit Suisse in a report.It noted, however, that “Chevron showed very strong production growth – up nearly 9.4 per cent year on year, which is largely consistent with its interim statement. Chevron is currently showing by far the strongest volume growth story in the integrateds.”Production for the full year 2009 averaged 2.70m b/d, an increase of 7 per cent compared with 2.53m b/d in 2008. The increases were driven by new projects in the US and Nigeria, as well as the expansion of capacity at Tengiz in Kazakhstan.Nonetheless, US exploration and production earnings of $1.04bn in the fourth quarter were down $105m from the year-earlier quarter. The higher production was offset by the absence of a gain on an asset-exchange transaction in the fourth quarter of 2008.International exploration and production earnings of $2.96bn increased $956m from the fourth quarter of 2008 on higher commodity prices and sales volumes for crude oil.Overall, for 2009, Chevron’s earnings fell 56 per cent to $10.5bn. Its revenue of $167bn was down from $265bn in 2008.“Earnings decreased in 2009 as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices and a decline in refined product sales margins, driven by a weak global economy,” said Mr Watson.“Our financial strength enabled continued investment in our excellent portfolio of capital and exploration projects and an increase in the annual dividend on our common shares for the twenty-second consecutive year,” he said.
391;COP;Conocophillips;2010-01-27T17:06:58Z;Conoco swings to profit in 2009;;ConocoPhillips, the US’s third-biggest oil company, reported full-year 2009 earnings of $4.9bn, compared with a loss of $17bn in 2008, when the economic downturn exposed weaknesses in its portfolio.Conoco announced a restructuring last year as the drop in demand and plunging commodity prices forced it to sell $10bn of its assets, cut its capital spending and refocus on exploration and production. The move comes after years of growth through mergers and acquisitions.For the fourth quarter of 2009, Conoco reported earnings of $1.2bn, or 81 cents per share, compared with a loss of $31.8bn, or $21.37 per share, from the same period in 2008.Its full-year production grew 3 per cent due to new production from major oil project developments in the UK, China, Canada, Norway, Vietnam and Russia.Total production, including Conoco’s share of Lukoil, was 2.29m barrels of oil equivalent per day. The company had three potentially significant discoveries, off the coast of Australia and in the Gulf of Mexico.The company cut costs by 12 per cent, exceeding its original target of $1.4bn, or 10 per cent, in reductions. Market factors, such as foreign currency and lower energy costs contributed about 60 per cent of the reductions.Savings were also realised through renegotiation of service and supply contracts, work force reductions and an ongoing focus on costs.Conoco plans to spend $11.2bn in 2010, with 86 per cent going to its exploration and production segment. The refining and marketing division will receive about 12 per cent.Conoco said it was responding to the difficult environment in the refining industry by lowering expenditures, managing costs and optimising its turnaround timing.In the fourth quarter, its worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilisation rate was 76 per cent. It deferred a planned upgrade project at its Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery.
392;COP;Conocophillips;2010-01-25T03:25:30Z;Hopes high for Chevron turnround;;Analysts will be looking for confirmation of a turnround at Chevron when the big US oil companies report their fourth-quarter 2009 financial results this week.After years of lacklustre production, which fell from 2.6m barrels per day of oil-equivalent production in the fourth quarter of 2007, to 2.5m in the same quarter in 2008, analysts are expecting the fourth quarter of 2009 to be a turning point for the second-biggest oil company in the US.James Neale, analyst at Credit Suisse Global Energy, says: “We expect the company to deliver over 9 per cent year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter, which is almost unprecedented for a supermajor.”However, the production growth may not be reflected in the group’s results, as weak refining and marketing sales are expected to bring down the entire sector. Indeed, warnings from Chevron this month have led Credit Suisse to revise down fourth-quarter 2009 forecasts by 12 per cent, from $1.97 earnings per share to $1.73.Among the other big US oil groups reporting this week, ConocoPhillips, the US’s third-biggest, will report on Wednesday, Occidental Petroleum on Thursday, Chevron on Friday and Exxon on February 1.Chevron, nonetheless, has had a good year. It reached peak production at its Agbami project in Nigeria, estimated to hold 1bn recoverable barrels of oil equivalent. In the Gulf of Mexico, its Blind Faith field reached production capacity in March 2009, and its Tahiti project achieved first oil in May 2009.In Brazil, Chevron’s Frade project achieved first oil in June 2009. In Angola, its Tombua-Landana project achieved first oil in September 2009.On top of that, Chevron obtained key approvals in 2009 to move forward with its massive Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia, which will provide longer-term growth.It expects first oil in 2010 from Perdido in the Gulf.“They are now on track,’’ says Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. Indeed, PFC notes Chevron has gone from having the lowest margins of the three US supermajors in 1999 to the largest margins in 2008.“Chevron’s per barrel margin in 2008 was over eight times what it was in 1999,’’ said Antonia Bullard, PFC senior director.
393;COP;Conocophillips;2010-01-13T22:48:44Z;Woodside LNG plan torpedoed;;East Timor has rejected a plan by Woodside Petroleum, the Australian energy group, to build the world’s first floating LNG plant, which would process gas from the Sunrise field.East Timor wants the liquefaction plant, which turns the gas to liquid so that it can be transported by tanker, to be built on its soil and has threatened to invite Malaysia’s Petronas to develop the field instead of Woodside and its partners, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Osaka Gas.“The current proposed plans of Woodside and the consortium partners to pipe gas from the Greater Sunrise field to either Darwin or a floating LNG would not be approved by the government of Timor-Leste,” East Timor said.The development of the Sunrise gas field, which is believed to hold more than 5,000bn cu ft of gas and 226m barrels of condensate, needs the approval of both the Australian and East Timorese governments.Independent analysts agree with Woodside that building the liquefaction plant in East Timor would be the worst of the three options.The Sunrise field is about 450km from Australia and only 150km from East Timor. But the path to East Timor is marred by a 3.3km deep trench in the seabed that poses a significant challenge to building a pipeline there.Financing the plant and persuading risk-averse Asian buyers to sign long-term contracts would be more challenging were the plant located in East Timor, a relatively volatile country, than if it were located at sea or in Australia, said Frank Harris, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based industry consultants.Until the East Timor issue is resolved, the project is stuck in limbo and going nowhere, said Mr Harris, adding that such a delay would prove more difficult for Woodside than its partners ConocoPhillips and Shell.Woodside had hoped to give the project the green light in 2011 after having already suffered delays.“If the Timorese aren’t happy, Woodside’s partners can in the meantime progress with other developments. Woodside can’t afford to walk away.”This is because Woodside’s expansion of the Pluto project in Western Australia is in doubt because the company has not yet found enough gas to warrant a second phase, while its Browse project, also in Western Australia, is facing the logistical difficulties of deciding where to develop its LNG plant.But delaying the project also carries a cost for East Timor because it has a share of the revenue.Woodside said last year that the production capacity of the project would be 5m tonnes a year if the gas were shipped to Australia and 4m tonnes a year if shipped to a floating plant.
394;COP;Conocophillips;2009-12-15T22:51:14Z;Exxon’s deal for XTO may open floodgates;;Exxon’s move to acquire XTO Energy for $41bn sets the stage for a round of mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector, where the world’s top five super-majors alone are holding cash reserves of over $75bn.Such activity has been constrained during the past 18 months because of uncertainties over carbon legislation, as well as the economic downturn and credit squeeze. Many industry observers expect business will continue to be slow for a while.PFC Energy, the consultancy, projects it will take until 2013 for global exploration and production capital spending to return to the 2008 peak of nearly $460bn, and the possibility of a double-dip recession could postpone this further.Nonetheless, analysts, consultants and energy companies are forecasting that deals across the energy industry will pick up in 2010, as the pressures of the past year continue to build. Several big companies have already said that they would shed assets, and some smaller companies are growing increasingly distressed.“The main driver for such M&A activity lies in the cash strength of probable acquirers – super-majors, Asian national oil companies and large independents,” says Jim Dillavou, a partner leading energy M&A transaction services at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm.“The world’s top five super-majors have cash reserves of more than $75bn, so the capacity is there for much greater M&A activity,” he says. “We have a lot of impatient buyers waiting for assets to come on the market.”In October, ConocoPhillips, the third largest US oil company, outlined plans to sell $10bn in assets over the next two years, including its 9 per cent stake in the Syncrude oil sands project in Canada.In November, Devon Energy, one of the biggest independents, said it wanted to sell its Gulf of Mexico and international assets for up to $7.5bn to pay down debt and focus on the high-return US and Canadian onshore assets.Executives say the market is swinging towards the buyer, with cash-rich oil companies in no hurry to spend their money and a lot of assets available, with more expected in 2010.Stephen Chazen, president and chief financial officer at Occidental Petroleum, the US’s fourth biggest oil and gas production company, says acquisitions by his company have “picked up sharply” in the fourth quarter of 2009.The sellers are individuals or small natural gas producers whose hedges for higher US natural gas prices are running out, with no sign of a return to the record high of $13.694 per million British thermal units seen in 2008. Many overextended themselves as prices rose to that record and have been barely hanging on as prices fell this year to a 7.5-year low.But deals of the size of XTO have been scarce, with overall transactions down about 50 per cent from June 2008 to June 2009, according to Jon McCarter, leader of transaction advisory services for Ernst & Young’s Americas Oil & Gas Centre.Negotiations began to pick up in July and August, leading Mr McCarter to expect a gradual increase in completed deals in 2010. One difficulty is disagreement on valuations, which has been compounded by uncertainty surrounding carbon legislation.Joe Stanislaw, head of the JA Stanislaw group, an independent advisory consultancy, said: “People don’t understand the full impact of carbon and the timing of legislation, whether it will come into effect over five or 10 years.”While Holli Nichols, chief financial officer of power producer Dynegy, said consolidation makes sense, given the benefits gained through scale and reducing duplicative efforts. But it remains hard to do a deal.“With these uncertainties out there, it’s hard for boards and CEOs to pull the trigger,” she said.
395;COP;Conocophillips;2009-12-14T18:59:57Z;ExxonMobil and XTO;;Large numbers impress. ExxonMobil’s $31bn agreed takeover of XTO Energy – an American peer that extracts difficult-to-reach gas – wowed markets on Monday. But if Exxon’s $331bn market capitalisation was the same as Goldman Sachs’ $87bn, the deal size proportionally wouldn’t make double figures. Still, it is noteworthy for three reasons.First, the all-scrip acquisition confirms a change of strategy. That matters – not because Exxon is the biggest major, but because it played the last cycle better than anyone. As energy prices bubbled higher, Exxon waited patiently, committing just 40 per cent of earnings on capital investment over the past three years, compared with between 85 and 100 per cent for BP, Shell and Chevron. Perhaps frustrated over that period, Exxon shareholders instead received enough cash to buy all of Conoco twice over. Now, however, Exxon seems to want to get involved. It was the only major to announce big spending increases as prices collapsed earlier this year and XTO is its largest deal in a decade.The second reason is timing. Gas prices have tumbled from $13 per million British thermal units, to $5 now, not least because the likes of XTO have found ways to extract gas from “unconventional” fields in shale and coalbed methane formations. Meanwhile, the recession has killed demand. Exxon boasts that it does not play prices. Still, the company reckons gas demand is going to outpace oil and coal over the next decade, helped along by tighter emission standards.Finally, this deal is noteworthy because XTO is selling. Original 1993 shareholders have made 50 times their money and plenty of analysts are bearish on gas prices. Exxon has a great record, but here has given few numbers and a decade-long pay-back period. Investors will have to take this one on trust.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
396;COP;Conocophillips;2009-12-13T20:19:23Z;US oil companies lose out in Iraq auction;;US oil groups were all but shut out from Iraq as it completed the biggest oil field auction in history.European groups, including Royal Dutch Shell, Lukoil and Gazprom, and Asian groups, such as China’s CNPC and Malaysia’s Petronas, were the main winners at Iraq’s second oil auction, which completed the sale of its large fields.The two biggest fields in the 10-lot auction – West Qurna 2 and the 12.6bn barrel Majnoon with reserves totalling some 25bn barrels– attracted many bids, although some smaller, conflict-hit fields went unsold.Thamir Ghadhban, a prime ministerial adviser and former oil minister, said: “We haven’t really seen US companies, and that is because of intense competition …The issue is financial and technical and not at all political.“This confirms Iraq can manage its oil policy and activities without politicisation.”Iraq has auctioned off more proved oil reserves than are held by the US, Mexico and UK combined.Lukoil, Russia’s biggest private oil company, together with Norway’s Statoil, on Saturday won the right to develop the West Qurna 2 field, which it had been coveting for more than a decade.Other winners on Saturday included Russia’s Gazprom and Sonangol, the Angolan state oil company, which was willing to commit to developing fields in one of Iraq’s most dangerous regions.On Friday, the first day of the latest auction, Royal Dutch Shell won the right to develop Majnoon, becoming the second UK company to secure one of Iraq’s biggest fields. Shell will partner Petronas, which was one of the most active companies in the auction.Also on Friday, CNPC, the Chinese state oil company, plus Total of France and Petronas, won the right to develop Halfaya, another sizable field.In June, BP became the first western oil group to be allowed back into Iraq in more than 30 years, reversing the nationalisation of Iraq’s oil industry in 1972.Iraq’s cabinet has since ratified the agreement and BP, together with China’s CNPC, are soon to begin repairing and developing Rumaila, Iraq’s biggest oil field. All the other deals still await ratification.In November, ExxonMobil, which won the rights to the West Qurna 1 field development, became the only US company to lead a winning bid, while California’s Occidental is the only US group to have won a deal as a junior partner.Chevron, the US’s second biggest oil company, has been absent, even though it had studied Iraq’s oil fields closely and was expected to bid. Insiders say the group was hampered by its conservative, risk-averse board.ConocoPhillips, the US’s third biggest oil company, which was expected to bid with Lukoil on West Qurna 2, was also absent. Analysts point out that Conoco­Phillips is struggling more than its peers financially.Companies have promised within a decade to boost Iraq’s oil production by at least 8.5m barrels a day to 11m b/d, more than Saudi Arabia produces.
397;COP;Conocophillips;2009-12-10T20:22:23Z;Bombs fail to deter oil auction bidders;;The world’s biggest oil companies will bid on Friday for the rights to Iraq’s largest undeveloped fields, shrugging off the threat of terrorism and fears over political instability.The live auction comes three days after bomb attacks in Baghdad claimed more than 110 lives and amid growing uncertainty over Iraq’s political future ahead of elections set for March 7.Despite those concerns, representatives of all the biggest international oil companies are expected to attend the two-day event at Iraq’s oil ministry in ­Baghdad. This will be the second auction. The first was held earlier this year and included Iraq’s already developed fields, which need modernisation following years of war and ­sanctions.“This week’s bomb blasts in Baghdad have put everyone on edge,” said one executive, adding that all parties were still expected to show up.Oil companies have markedly changed their attitude since early this year when they insisted on a hydro­carbon law and better security before they would enter the country. When disagreements with the Kurdistan regional government killed the hydrocarbon law, companies downgraded their requirements to political stability.That is becoming less certain, but all the companies are eager for the chance to tap Iraq’s fields, which have been closed to foreigners since 1972, when Saddam Hussein, then the vice-president, nationalised Iraq’s oil industry.For European companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and Total, along with Chevron and ConocoPhillips, their US competitors, the opening of Iraq’s oilfields offers a rare chance to work in the Middle East’s biggest reserves. Other countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, remain closed.Adam Sieminski, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, notes that geologists believe Iraq’s oil reserves could rival those of Saudi Arabia and that its production could be twice its current rate of 2.5m barrels a day in five years. “Fields in Iraq like West Qurna and Majnoon are world class and they are undeveloped. That kind of return seems worth some risk if you think you can manage it,” he said.Iraq’s oilfields are technically easy and relatively cheap to develop. The companies are so eager to enter Iraq that they are bending to the strict fiscal terms Baghdad has set.Friday’s auction could add another 3m barrels a day to Iraq’s output and the oil ministry has said it is aiming for 10m b/d, a level that would catapult Iraq into the same league as Russia and Saudi Arabia.It is a tall order and several executives have complained that the amounts are just not achievable.Christophe de Margerie, Total’s chief executive, called the volumes “crazy”. He said: “We know there’s a potential to maybe reach 7m to 8m barrels some day, and that alone would be a tremendous success.”
398;COP;Conocophillips;2009-12-02T04:16:15Z;Exxon CEO’s bonus cut by 40%;;Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, will receive a 7 per cent increase in salary to $2.2m in 2010, but his year-end bonus for 2009 is to drop by almost half.Exxon’s board of directors cut his 2009 bonus to $2.4m, down 40 per cent from 2008 after profits were hit by the economic downturn and lower oil prices. The company’s profits were lifted in 2008 by record-high commodity prices.This past year has been tougher on the industry in general, with lower commodity prices and the global economic downturn. In the third quarter, Exxon’s profit plunged 68 per cent on the grim outlook.But analysts have continued to support Mr Tillerson’s strategic leadership at Exxon, which has enabled it to continue spending in spite of falling profits and an uncertain year ahead. It has invested $19bn through the first three quarters to develop new energy supplies, while competitors have sharply cut back.In the past 18 months, BP has cut 6,500 jobs – more than the 5,000 it had originally announced it would cut – and said this week it had lifted its cost-cutting target for this year to $4bn from $3bn.Royal Dutch Shell said in October that 5,000 staff would be forced to leave the Anglo-Dutch group as part of a restructuring begun this year.ConocoPhillips has announced plans to sell $10bn in assets during the next wo years as part of a restructuring that has included job cuts and cost-saving measures.Exxon maintains a steady capital-spending programme through the ups and downs in commodity prices.But it is not known for overly generous bonuses. Indeed, Exxon is conservative in this regard, compared with other, less well performing energy companies. The most significant bonus of 2008 was that of Aubrey McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, one of the US’s biggest natural gas producers, who received a bonus of more than $75m after Chesapeake’s falling stock price forced him to sell more than 90 per cent of his shares to meet a margin call from his creditors.Yet Exxon had the highest return on capital employed of 2008 and the second highest total shareholder return.
399;COP;Conocophillips;2009-11-30T23:01:09Z;Industrial groups warn over US climate law;;Industrial companies operating in the US are warning that they will face a heavy regulatory burden should US Congress fail to pass climate change legislation.The companies fear that without legislation, the US Environmental Protection Agency would impose its own rules on greenhouse-gas emissions or states would introduce different carbon pollution regimes.Peter Molinaro, head of government affairs at Dow Chemical, the largest US chemicals group, told the Financial Times that the proliferation of such initiatives would present “an enormous administrative burden” for companies that operate across different regimes.“Manufacturers are having enough trouble in this country competing with foreign companies,” Mr Molinaro said. “We’d be adding administrative and cost burden where we shouldn’t.”Alison Taylor, vice-president of sustainability for the Americas at Siemens, the German engineering group, said businesses needed to know the price of carbon for planning reasons. “How do you have one price of carbon if you’ve got four or five different regimes?” she said.President Barack Obama had hoped that Congress would pass cap-and-trade legislation before next week’s United Nations Climate Change conference in Copenhagen.However, the focus on healthcare and the economy means he will arrive in Denmark empty-handed.Nevertheless, Mr Obama is expected to pledge that the US will cut carbon emissions.A climate bill was squeezed through the House of Representatives in June, but a bipartisan proposal that could be presented in the Senate as soon as this week faces an uphill battle.“The chances of getting a bill passed continue to be very uncertain,” said David Brown, head of federal affairs at Exelon, the biggest operator of nuclear power plants in the US.That raises the prospect that US states or regions could initiate their own mandatory regimes or that the Environmental Protection Agency could impose greenhouse-gas emissions limits.The US already has one mandatory regional cap-and-trade programme in the form of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which includes 10 north-eastern states.Without federal legislation, similar schemes are likely to spring up elsewhere.California last week announced a plan for its own cap-and-trade system.The climate change issue has split the business world.Trade associations such as the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, and big energy groups such as ConocoPhillips and Chevron oppose the climate bill that passed the House, saying it will kill off US manufacturing jobs.That stance has alienated companies that support the measure.Nike and Apple are among the businesses that have withdrawn from the US Chamber of Commerce over its stance on the issue.
400;COP;Conocophillips;2009-11-29T18:20:49Z;Oil and gas chiefs win bonuses despite missing targets;;Several oil and natural gas companies in the US and Europe boosted their chief executives’ remuneration last year, in spite of often missing performance targets or other measures of investor value, data collected by the Financial Times show.The most significant bonus of 2008 was that of Aubrey McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, one of the US’s biggest natural gas producers.Mr McClendon, who founded Chesapeake in 1989, received a bonus of more than $75m after Chesapeake’s falling stock price forced him to sell more than 90 per cent of his shares to meet a margin call from his creditors.In Europe, the Royal Dutch Shell board granted top management a bonus even though the company missed performance targets linked to the award.Mr McClendon came lowest in the FT’s rankings of “best value” chief in the energy industry last year, while Jeroen van der Veer of Shell came 20th of 35, making him the lowest-ranked European.The ranking equally weighted one-year total shareholder return, return on equity employed, and pay, all for 2008. Almost all oil and gas companies generated negative returns to shareholders last year and many did not meet their internal targets.Nevertheless, most compensation packages rose over the period, according to data provided by Equilar, the executive pay analysts.Hye-Won Choi, head of corporate governance at TIAA-CREF, the big US pension fund, says investors want pay to be linked to performance. “Especially during economic downturns . . . there is a heavy burden on company boards to explain why their chief executive is an exception,” she said.“The often-used argument for paying large compensation packages to retain executives doesn’t hold water in this job market,” she added.The highest-paid executives in the FT survey – Mr McClendon and Nabors’ Eugene Isenberg – were also ranked at the bottom end of their peer group in terms of shareholder return as well as return on capital employed, a metric used to determine how efficiently a company is run.Top rank went to Harold Korell, chief executive of Southwestern, the US natural gas producer, and the only company in the survey to manage a positive shareholder return in 2008.
401;COP;Conocophillips;2009-11-29T17:40:34Z;Executive pay at US energy groups higher;;Among the big international oil and gas groups, executives at US companies earned more than their European counterparts. However, most of them – with the notable exception of ConocoPhillips – also had better results in terms of return on capital employed and total return to shareholders.One example of this was Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Dallas-based ExxonMobil, the biggest energy group by market capitalisation. Mr Tillerson’s total compensation was $23.9m, more than that of his European counterparts at BG, Royal Dutch Shell and BP. But Exxon also had the highest return on capital employed (Roce) of 2008 and the second-highest total shareholder return (TSR).Mr Tillerson therefore ranked sixth on the FT’s survey of best-value chief executives in the energy industry, in spite of his large compensation.In general, companies still partially owned by the state paid less than those without any state ownership. StatoilHydro, the Norwegian oil company, about two-thirds of which is owned by the state, paid Helge Lund, its chief executive, $1.8m in 2008. Statoil’s compensation package is one of the smallest in the industry and the only one in the group that was fundamentally altered because of the economic downturn.The economic uncertainty prompted the company to cut in half – to 25 per cent of pay – the bonus Mr Lund was able to receive for 2008 and the last quarter of 2007. Despite this, Mr Lund only ranked eighth because of weak TSR and Roce scores.“One of the key differences between the US and many other developed markets is that there’s no national best practice standard in the US, making it very much a free market orientated approach,” says Carol Bowie, head of the Governance Institute at Risk Metrics, the investor advisory firm.Another reason is that US shareholders are even more powerless than Europeans, points out Anne Simpson, senior portfolio manager for global equities at Calpers, the US’s biggest pension fund.But that may change next year, if the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, changes its rules to allow shareholders more power in deciding board membership. Calpers is aggressively lobbying for the change. “We are fighting tooth and nail,” Ms Simpson says.The total compensation of only nine chief executives dropped from in 2008 compared to 2007, when oil prices and profits were still rising. As an industry subset, refiners, whose profit margins have been hit hard by the downturn, were the only ones to cut compensation across the board. All three refiners in the FT’s group showed lower compensation in 2008 than 2007.
402;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oil crunch: Crisis or a rosy future?;;"A string of impressive discoveries from America to West Africa have prompted optimism that a widely-touted supply crunch may not be as imminent as industry watchers have suggested.Some executives say that the drop in demand and the overhang in capacity will delay an oil crunch for some time to come.Ian Taylor, head of energy trader Vitol, notes that tanker rates are still below marginal cost, US refineries are running at little more than 80 per cent capacity and distillates are being stored in tankers around the world because no one wants to buy them: “We think there has been over-investment in the supply chain,” he says. “Even with strong [economic] growth, oil demand will not absorb the capacity for several years.”Others take a different view, believing China’s oil demand will bounce back and uncertainty in volatile countries such as Venezuela and Nigeria could quickly drive up prices.“It does not take a lot to take 2m barrels a day off the market,” counters Albert Helmig, president of the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange.Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of Total, this month challenged industry executives to stand up and disprove his theory that the world would never be able to produce more than 100m b/d – about 20 per cent more than present production rates – because much of the remaining oil lies in countries either unable or unwilling to tap it.There are two main reasons many in the industry believe oil prices could spike. First, new discoveries have struggled to outpace the speed with which old fields are declining. The world depends on a few giant, old, slowing fields and nothing has been found to compare with them since the 1970s, argues Matthew Simmons, a consultant and former investment banker.One of the starkest declines is that of the Cantarell field. A 25 per cent annual drop in production means Mexico, one of Latin America’s largest oil exporters, may become a net importer by the end of the decade.Second, as oil prices have fallen, companies have trimmed budgets. Investment cuts have led many in the industry to worry that a supply crunch risks pushing oil prices back above $100 a barrel.ConocoPhillips, the US group, plans to cut capital spending by $1.5bn and shed $10bn in costs over two years; Eni of Italy, has slashed its dividend to continue funding its operations; oil projects in high-cost areas such as Canada’s oil sands have been delayed and exploration licensing rounds, such as in Algeria, have yielded less interest than in the past.Falling prices in the oil services sector, which provides equipment such as rigs and pipes, should have eased cost pressures, but as oil prices have settled at around $70-$80 a barrel, so have the falling costs. This makes it more difficult for companies to avoid delaying marginal and more expensive projects.But all is not lost. The oil industry has recently had more reason for optimism: oil prices are up on signs of economies strengthening and Iraq appears serious about allowing oil companies to develop its huge fields – development deals under discussion could add 7m b/d to Iraq’s production.Moreover, exciting discoveries around the world show that the seven years of oil price rises that ended in 2008 prompted smaller companies to explore virgin territories and encouraged larger companies to make big bets on new technology.Anadarko of the US and Tullow of the UK struck oil off the coast of Sierra Leone, signalling that the coastal waters from that country to Ghana, site of the large Jubilee field, may be rich in oil.BP crossed a new frontier in the Gulf of Mexico, a well-known oil region, by finding oil trapped in deeper rocks than ever previously found.But the area getting most attention is Brazil. A recent discovery by Petrobras, the state oil company, has prompted upward revisions of the country’s reserves.These discoveries need billions of dollars in investment. It will be up to oil-rich governments to make sure the investment climate allows this to happen.But executives also warn that oil-consuming governments must also make sure their policies to reduce carbon dioxide do not make oil and gas exploration so unattractive that investment falls before greener alternatives become available."
403;COP;Conocophillips;2009-11-04T16:33:49Z;Australia: Competition for infrastructure resources;;"The world’s liquefied natural gas industry sat up and paid attention in September when Chevron approved the A$43bn Gorgon natural gas project off the coast of Western Australia.With more than an estimated 40,000bn cu ft of natural gas in its fields, Gorgon is a significant resource for fast-growing Asian economies. But Gorgon’s go-ahead will worry the developers of the more than two dozen LNG projects in Australia and neighbouring Papua New Guinea.Analysts say less than half have a chance of reaching so-called “final investment decision”, and securing customers will be crucial for their survival.Richard Quin, a Perth-based analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultants, says the scale of Gorgon will place heavy demands on Australia, from labour and logistical support to housing: “At every point, Gorgon will put considerable pressure on the system given how big it is.”On top of Gorgon, Australia has two other significant LNG projects in production – Woodside Petroleum’s North-West Shelf venture and ConocoPhillips’ Darwin LNG plant, and a third in construction, Woodside’s Pluto project.“As Pluto is still in the construction phase and with the North-West Shelf gas project continuing to invest in new offshore infrastructure development, capacity in Australia is already stretched,” Mr Quin says. “Gorgon will, however, take the challenge to a whole new level.”As well as logistics, the proposed LNG projects face hurdles in the current economic climate, the greatest of which is gaining market share given the number of competing projects. That question is particularly relevant for the four groups trying to convert coal bed methane reserves in the eastern Australian state of Queensland into LNG.The CBM industry is still young but it has attracted big names: the UK’s BG Group; a joint venture between ConocoPhillips and Australia’s Origin Energy; Australia’s Santos and Petronas of Malaysia and Royal Dutch Shell with Arrow Energy.Three of these are looking to reach final investment decision within about eight months, although some analysts believe ConocoPhillips/Origin Energy is lagging its rivals.Adrian Wood, an analyst at Macquarie Group, says the rising number of LNG projects in Australia will intensify competition to secure off-take agreements and contractor capacity to build infrastructure.He predicts “big bottlenecks” in the LNG sector, and warns that contractors seeking to build part of their kit offshore will encounter limits in Asia’s steel fabrication factories.“There are likely to be losers whose projects are significantly delayed or worse still scrapped,” he says.However, he adds that few projects to date seem to be having problems finding customers, and long-term contracts have been signed at attractive prices.“We believe that this bullish longer-term pricing environment reflects buyer concerns over China’s determination to aggressively grow its LNG imports,” he says.China has a stated target to increase LNG imports to 60m tonnes per annum by 2020.“On the supply side, the worry is that Australia will struggle to deliver the huge number of projects that the market expects in a timely fashion,” says Mr Wood.He adds that of the 48 LNG processing trains being considered, 17 are undergoing front-end engineering and design activities (Feed). However, he believes Australia has the resources to build only four to six simultaneously.“Developments need to be synchronised which means that many will be significantly delayed,” he says.Delays of one, two or three years could lead to LNG shortages.Problems also arise because most of the big individual LNG projects are owned by multiple parties.The Woodside-operated Browse gas fields, for example, have encountered difficulties over what part of the Australian coast to locate the LNG processing facilities, while Sunrise, which straddles the maritime borders between Australia and East Timor, has also been complicated by where to locate its processing facilities.“These are quality fields and they would be significant developments if they overcome the hurdles,” says one analyst.In barely three years, Australia has become one of the world’s most attractive LNG markets. Gorgon and the boom in Queensland’s CBM industry have added to the country’s allure but they will cause headaches for some of the developers hoping to get their projects over the line."
404;COP;Conocophillips;2009-11-02T07:31:05Z;Woodside offloads Otway stake;;Woodside Petroleum, Australia’s second largest oil and gas producer, has agreed to sell its 51.55 per cent stake in the Otway gas project off Australia’s south-east coast to Origin Energy for A$713m ($643m).Monday’s sale comes as Woodside focuses on its large gas projects off the Western Australian coast, including its North-West Shelf venture and the construction of its Pluto project.To help fund developments, Woodside is selling non-core assets such as Otway.Origin, which is increasing its Otway stake to 82.3 per cent, will become operator of the project subject to joint venture and regulatory agreements.Origin is one of Australia’s biggest electricity and gas retailers. In partnership with ConocoPhillips of the US, Origin is also developing coal bed methane reserves in Queensland that it plans to convert into liquefied natural gas.Grant King, Origin managing director, said Otway was “a premier asset with established production”.“Increasing our interest in the project provides additional earnings from natural gas sold under existing long term contracts to TRUenergy [the Australian unit of CLP, Hong Kong’s largest power company] as well as from LPG [liquid petroleum gas] and condensate sold from the liquids-rich gas stream,” Mr King said.The transaction is forecast to be earnings accretive in first financial year after completion.Origin will fund the purchase from existing resources. The group has A$4.4bn of cash reserves and undrawn bank facilities.The Otway gas project started production just over two year ago.Gas is extracted using the remotely operated Thylacine platform and brought to shore via pipelines to a processing plant north of Port Campbell.Condensate and liquefied petroleum gas are also produced at the plant.Over the life of the plant, the Thylacine and Geographe fields are expected to produce 950bn cubic feet of raw gas, (equivalent to 885 petajoules of natural gas), 12.2m barrels of condensate, and 1.7m tonnes of LPG.
405;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-30T16:38:55Z;Chevron’s production grows as profits fall;;Chevron, the second-biggest US oil company, on Friday reported nearly 11 per cent growth in net oil-equivalent production – a rise far above that of its peers.After years of criticism by analysts for poor execution even after exploration successes, analysts say Chevron has become an industry leader in production growth.“Chevron is currently by far the strongest volume growth story in the integrateds,” said Mark Flannery, oil analyst at Credit Suisse. ”This is the best set of results from Chevron for a long time.”The production success came despite a 51 per cent fall in net income from the year-earlier period to $3.83bn, on plunging commodity prices that have been a drag on the entire sector’s results. Chevron’s revenue was $46.6bn, down from $78.9bn.“This operational success helped mitigate a decline in earnings that was driven by sharply lower prices for crude oil and natural gas,’’ said Dave O’Reilly, Chevron’s chief executive.The growth was driven primarily by the startup of new Gulf of Mexico production and was also boosted by a particularly mild hurricane season in the area.The companies production volumes exceeded even those of BP, whose output grew 7 per cent from the third quarter of 2008 as fields such as Thunderhorse in the Gulf of Mexico came online after after severe delays.Chevron is set to continue its production growth developing the Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia.Mr O’Reilly said the Gorgon project represents a “major milestone in the company’s strategy to commercialize its significant natural gas resource base in Australia.’’The production gains helped Chevron’s results beat most of its peers. Only BP matched it, with just a 50 per cent drop in profits in the third quarter.The world’s biggest publicly listed oil company, ExxonMobil, reported a 65 per cent drop in profits, Shell revealed a 73 per cent drop, while ConocoPhillips posted a 71 per cent drop.Chevron’s share price dropped 2.18 per cent to $76.42 at midday as the overall market fell.
406;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Royal Dutch Shell;;"After the high, the jagged hinterland of the lows. Both Shell and Exxon pumped out fewer profits in the third quarter than bullish earnings from BP and ConocoPhilips had led investors to expect. Shell’s chief executive Peter Voser was also downbeat about economic recovery, saying he didn’t see much of it, and what there was looked weak. Investors were disappointed; Shell’s shares dropped 5 per cent.It was not as bad as that, though. Mr Voser, in charge since July, is busy cutting out costs – $1bn so far this year. That is less than BP’s $4bn but all of these savings are permanent irrespective of the economic cycle, compared with two-thirds at BP. Furthermore, Mr Voser has cut Shell’s workforce by 5 per cent, a saving that will not become apparent until next year.More fundamentally, Shell is producing prodigious amounts of cash. That is despite the low price of gas, of which Shell is a big producer, and the fact that a large chunk of its balance sheet is tied up in projects that are not producing yet. By the end of 2010, when Shell will start to harvest these investments in Qatar, Russia and elsewhere, production and cash flows will rise commensurately. In the meantime, Shell is having to spend all its cash flow on capital expenditure ($7.4bn), leaving it to borrow $2.7bn to fund the dividend. Still, with net debt only 14 per cent of equity, compared with a 20 per cent year-end target, Shell’s balance sheet remains protected by a mollusc-like carapace.For investors, Shell’s project pipeline makes the stock a promise of jam tomorrow. Yet, despite his downbeat message, Mr Voser felt confident enough about that tomorrow arriving to maintain a dividend increase pledged nine months ago. In the current climate, few other companies dare to do the same.Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday that a total of 5,000 staff would be leaving the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas group as part of a restructuring begun earlier this year.Shell also said third-quarter profit declined 73 per cent to $2.99bn on a current cost of supplies basis, a closely watched post-tax measure that removes the effect of price changes on inventories.“We see some indications that energy demand and pricing are improving, but the outlook remains very uncertain and we are not expecting a quick recovery,” Mr Voser said in a statement.Mr Voser added that annualised operating cost savings for the first nine months of the year had grown to $1bn, excluding the impact of exchange rate movements and non-cash pension costs. The dividend was set at $0.42, an increase of 5 per cent.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"
407;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-29T13:50:15Z;Exxon piles $19bn into fresh supplies;;ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly listed oil company, said on Thursday it had invested $19bn through the first three quarters to develop new energy supplies, as it unveiled a 65 per cent year-on-year slump in quarterly earnings caused by falling commodity prices.The US company reported $4.7bn in earnings, down 65 per cent from the year-earlier quarter, on the fall in commodity prices from last year’s record highs and higher operating costs. It brought in $82.3bn in revenue, down from $137.7bn in the third quarter of 2008.“Despite ongoing global economic weakness and reduced demand for products, we continued our robust investment programme and delivered strong results,’’ said Rex Tillerson, chief executive. “Our commitment to a disciplined and long-term, focused investment strategy sets ExxonMobil apart from its competitors.’’The group has traditionally maintained a steady capital-spending programme through the ups and downs in commodity prices.“ExxonMobil’s industry-leading financial strength has allowed us to continue to invest across the economic cycle, focusing on world-class opportunities,” Mr Tillerson said.During the third quarter, Exxon also continued with its share-buyback programme, buying back 61m of its shares for $4.2bn. The company plans to spend $2bn in the fourth quarter repurchasing shares.In the past 18 months, BP has shed 6,500 jobs – more than the 5,000 it had originally announced it would cut – and said this week it had lifted its cost-cutting target for this year to $4bn from $3bn.Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday a total of 5,000 staff would be leaving the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas group as part of a restructuring begun this year.ConocoPhillips outlined plans to sell $10bn in assets during the next two years as part of a restructuring that has included job cuts and cost-saving measures.Exxon recorded a nearly 3 per cent increase in oil-equivalent production for the third quarter. Excluding the impact of Opec quotas, divestments and other factors, it said, the figure would have been about 5 per cent.It was helped by the start-up of major liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar and noted other big projects, such as the Gorgon LNG project in Australia, would contribute to “long plateau production for decades”.
408;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture).

409;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Conoco details plans to sell assets;;ConocoPhillips, the third largest US oil company, outlined plans to sell $10bn worth of assets over the next two years on Wednesday, including its 9 per cent stake in the Syncrude oil sands project in Canada.Jim Mulva, chief executive, said Conoco also would sell the bottom-performing 10 per cent of its exploration and production assets in Canada and the continental US, some natural gas assets in the North Sea, and pipelines and terminals in the US.“We have received a lot of phone calls,” he said. “We think that what we have in mind is achievable.”The asset sale programme was announced earlier this month, along with a $1.5bn cutback in 2010 capital spending.The company this year pledged to scrap its growth-through-acquisition strategy to focus on organic growth.The flaws in that strategy emerged when falling commodity prices forced it to take a $34bn writedown on the reduction in its asset values at the start of the year, cut 1,300 jobs, and scale back capital expenditures to $12.5bn this year from $15.3bn in 2008.Mr Mulva said Conoco would not cut spending in exploration and production, which would receive 90 per cent of the $11bn in capital spending planned annually for the next few years.The fall in oil and natural gas prices from last year’s highs is still taking its toll.Conoco on Wednesday rep-orted earnings of $1.5bn, or $1 per share, in the third quarter, down 71 per cent from the year-earlier quarter.Conoco’s shares fell $1.41, or 2.7 per cent, to $49.49.ConocoPhillips’ stake in Syncrude is expected to attract interest both from companies that have a stake in the oil sands and from newcomers.One likely bidder is Calgary-based Canadian Oilsands Trust, Syncrude’s biggest shareholder with 37 per cent. Its partners include, among others, ExxonMobil, Nippon Oil, Suncor and Nexen.Chinese and South Korean oil groups have stepped up their interest in the oil sands as a way of securing future oil supplies.Korea National Oil Corporation bought Harvest Energy Trust for $1.8bn earlier this month, while PetroChina paid $1.9bn for two oil sands projects.The Alberta oil sands are estimated to contain the world’s biggest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia.Mr Mulva said its full-year cost-reduction target of $1.4bn had been achieved, and said the company’s “refocused exploration programme” was delivering strong results, pointing to efforts in the Gulf of Mexico, onshore US shale gas and in Australia’s Browse Basin.
410;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-28T20:40:40Z;Energy and financials drag Wall St lower;;US equities fell on Wednesday, tugged lower by a broad range of stocks in the materials, energy and financial sectors.At the New York close the Standard & Poor’s 500 marked its fourth straight decline, losing almost 2 per cent to 1,042.63. The index has given up 5 per cent from a 2009 high reached on October 19.The S&P 500, which bottomed in early March, remains per 15.4 cent higher for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday fell 1.2 per cent to 9,762.69. The Nasdaq Composite closed 2.7 per cent lower at 2059.61.Investors have lately been leery of buying into signs of a stronger economy, said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“Early on it was a reluctance to believe in the recovery,” he said. “As people become more convinced about the recovery, they really remain concerned about how far the markets have moved.”Third-quarter corporate earnings announcements on Wednesday sent mixed messages on the economic recovery.Among the stocks most punished was Goodyear, the tyremaker, whose revenues declined 15 per cent in the quarter. It dropped 19.6 per cent to $13.46 as the group indicated that its North American business faced struggles.International Paper declined 3.5 per cent to $21.83 after telling investors that seasonally weak demand would render “significantly lower” results in the final quarter of the year from the past quarter.A report that sales of new houses in the US fell a surprise 3.6 per cent in September also damped market sentiment. Shares of Lennar, a builder, fell 7.5 per cent to $12.63.Energy stocks felt pressure. US coal miner Massey Energy sank 8.5 per cent to $28.66 as weak demand from power plants triggered a profit drop. Rival Peabody Energy was 6 per cent lower at $39.64.ConocoPhillips, the first big US oil producer to report results this week, was down 2.8 per cent at $49.49 after announcing a 71 per cent drop in profit to $1.5bn, or $1 a share.A steep decline in crude futures on Wednesday also dented its shares.Financial stocks sputtered. Insurer Genworth Financial fell 7.6 per cent to $8.69 while insurer MBIA fell 8.2 per cent to $4.02.Meanwhile, card payment processor Visa rose 3.6 per cent to $76.57 after beating profit forecasts and indicating that consumer spending could be firming up.The Commerce Department reported orders for long-lived goods from US manufacturers rose 1 per cent last month, marking a reversal from a decline in August.“Through the month-to-month volatility, the improvement in manufacturing activity is evident across a large number of reports, and this is another one that fits into that picture,” analysts at RDQ Economics wrote in a note.Yet industrial stocks did not reflect optimism. US Steel fell 5 per cent to $35.53 after its quarterly loss announced this week was followed by disappointing results at ArcelorMittal, the largest steelmaker. Aluminium group Alcoa fell 6.9 per cent to $11.93.Norfolk Southern, the fourth-largest US rail transporter, rose 0.4 per cent to $46.25 after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings late on Tuesday. Rail company Union Pacific rose 0.7 per cent to $55.45.Among the handful of initial public offerings this week, Vitamin Shoppe, a US health supplement retailer, which was priced at $17 a share, ended its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a bang at $17.95 a share.Addus HomeCare, which provides home health care, traded 15.1 per cent below its initial offer price of $10 a share.Telecoms gained. Qwest Communications rose 2.6 per cent to $3.54 after beating profit forecasts and pledging new cost cuts.Verizon Communications closed 2.6 per cent higher at $29.95 a share.Newspaper companies were trailing after reporting dismal circulation trends this week.Gannett, the largest US publisher, fell 10.1 per cent to $10.40 a share. New York Times dropped 11.8 per cent to $8.56.
411;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-28T16:51:30Z;Energy: Power-hungry region puts gas top of the menu;;Energy is at the heart of everything Abu Dhabi has done and hopes to achieve.The emirate has about 95 per cent of the United Arab Emirates’ proven oil reserves – about 8.5 per cent of the world’s reserves – and petrodollars have enabled Abu Dhabi to become the nation’s financial and political powerhouse.Experts forecast Abu Dhabi will be able to keep pumping crude for another 100 years and the emirate has been steadily working to expand production.The current capacity is about 2.9m barrels per day (it produces about 2.2m barrels per day, in line with Opec cuts) and the plan is to reach 3.7m barrels per day by 2017.However, while the picture for oil remains rosy, there is increasing urgency to produce more gas to meet rapidly growing energy demands in Abu Dhabi and the wider UAE – even during the economic downturn energy use was rising at between 8 and 9 per cent in Abu Dhabi.The UAE is already a net importer of gas, bringing in 2bn cubic feet per day from Qatar through the Dolphin Pipeline, which serves about 60 per cent of the nation’s gas usage for power generation.Like other states in the oil-rich Gulf, it is not that the UAE does not have gas, rather it is a question of how it utilises the increasingly precious resource and brings more of it on line.At the beginning of 2007, the UAE had proven gas reserves of 214,000bn cu ft – the fifth-largest in the world – according to the US Energy Information Administration.The vast majority of the UAE’s reserves, like oil, are in Abu Dhabi, but the problem for the emirate is that significant amounts exist as “associated gas”, which means it is dissolved in the liquids of oil reservoirs, so accessing it is dependent on crude production. Also, much of the associated gas is re-injected to maintain reservoir pressure of the oil fields (making extraction easier), or to produce condensates – a type of natural gas liquid (NGL).Meanwhile, a large amount of the emirate’s non-associated gas is sour, with a high content of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), making it highly corrosive, expensive and technically challenging to develop.“There are huge demands for gas re-injection in Abu Dhabi, unlike Saudi Arabia, to sustain increased production at their oil fields because of the nature of their geology,” says Colin Lothian, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “In addition to that, they have several very large gas recycling schemes so they re-inject the gas to produce natural gas liquids. It’s a value proposition – the NGLs are very important revenue streams.”In a bid to reap export revenues from oil and condensate production as well as meeting domestic demand, Abu Dhabi has put in place a number of programmes to bring additional gas online. This includes new exploration, the construction of a pipeline that will enable up to 700m cu ft to be produced offshore and piped to the mainland, and the development of Shah – an onshore sour field – which if successful, could open up extraction at other sour sites.ConocoPhillips signed an agreement last year with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) to develop the Shah field. It is hoped that production will start around 2013, with a target for gas sales of between 500m and 700m cu ft per day. The project is estimated to cost at least $10bn.“Shah will be the first time technology has been tried to produce large quantities of gas at such high levels of H2S in the UAE – it will in some ways be a pilot,” says an official in Abu Dhabi.But even if the sour gas development does prove successful, officials acknowledge that the emirate will struggle to meet the growth in domestic demand. And without finding solutions, the UAE will have to burn increasing amounts of oil-related liquids for power generation, leaving less to export. Oil fuels are already being used during peak periods.The result is that Abu Dhabi, which has the additional burden of providing gas for the other emirates, is looking beyond hydrocarbons for solutions.These include the ambitious Masdar Initiative, on which the emirate is spending billions of dollars in the hope of developing renewable energy technology, in particular solar power.However, the main initiative is the UAE’s plan – led and funded by Abu Dhabi – to develop a nuclear programme by 2017. It is hoped that a civilian nuclear trade agreement with the US will pass through the US Congress shortly, after which the UAE is expected to award a contract for the construction of the nation’s first nuclear power plants, which could be producing between 4,000 and 5,500 megawatts of electricity by 2020.“Other countries in the region have used gas to the point where they didn’t have enough so had to start diverting oil production into the utilities sector – what the UAE is desperately trying to do is not follow that path,” says an official familiar with the nuclear programme.“If we did nothing, we could find ourselves in a situation where all of our production growth would be offset by domestic consumption, which would reduce our ability to export.”
412;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-25T23:08:39Z;Focus falls on possible Exxon prey;;ExxonMobil, the US oil major, will report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday, when investors will be looking out for any further indications it is on the acquisition trail.The world’s biggest publicly listed oil company had a record $60bn in cash flow from operating activities last year – a warchest that analysts expected it would spend acquiring assets from groups struggling to cope with dropping demand and plunging commodity prices.Yet Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive, said early this year that the oil group was waiting for the market to settle before making its move.This month, Exxon struck, agreeing to acquire a large stake in Ghana’s Jubilee oil field from its private equity owners, paying about $4bn to get into one of the world’s most potentially lucrative oil discoveries in recent years.“This is the first Exxon deal in the public glare that I can remember in some time,’’ said Mark Flannery, oil and gas analyst at Credit Suisse.Exxon offered to buy the 23.5 per cent stake in Jubilee currently held by Kosmos, the independent US oil producer backed by private equity groups Blackstone and Warburg Pincus.The other main stakeholders in Jubilee are Anadarko Petroleum of the US and the UK’s Tullow Oil.But analysts have found the deal to be an uncharacteristically small one for Exxon.“The Ghana field in and of itself is not material enough for Exxon,’’ Mr Flannery noted. “It’s hard to see Exxon being satisfied with that one asset. To build a meaningful presence in the area, it couldn’t be the end of the story.’’But the story might not even start, he notes, given the Ghanaian government’s objections to the sale. The Ghana National Petroleum Corporation wants to buy the stake itself, with the backing of another foreign partner.Many oil groups, from China’s CNOOC to the UK’s BP, are thought to be interested in Jubilee, as it forms part of a newly discovered oil coast that stretches off West Africa from Sierra Leone to Ghana.In a world that has been exploiting its oil assets for some 100 years, such finds are increasingly scarce, and are therefore attractive to Exxon, as well as its rivals.“The Exxon strategy is based on the efficient execution of large, long-life assets,’’ said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. “This play [for Jubilee] is absolutely consistent with that strategy.’’Analysts note that Exxon could go as far as buying the other investors in the Jubilee project, Anadarko and Tullow, in order to gain access to the new oil coast.“They could have always bought up an Anadarko,’’ Mr West said. “The challenge of the big oil companies is to create repeatable investment opportunities of scale and returns.’’Such opportunities are few and far between, and that might be the reason Exxon has appeared to hold back so far this year.Meanwhile, Exxon and other international oil companies have this year been taking on new roles, in managing large operations for the national oil companies that control most of the world’s reserves, such as liquefied natural gas projects.Analysts say the drop in commodity prices and global demand prompted national oil companies to seek their expertise, as they found their fields declining faster than anticipated.“The national oil companies have suffered without the experience the international oil companies bring,’’ said Gary Adams, vice-chairman of oil and gas at Deloitte, the consultancy.Oil majors are also building large natural gas positions for the long term, he said. Demand for natural gas, extraction of which is far less carbon intensive than oil, is going to rise in the next 20 years, he said. “That’s the long-term play.’’It might well be the next focus of Exxon’s acquisition strategy.Other big oil groups to report this week are Conoco-Phillips on Wednesday and Chevron on Friday.
413;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-13T18:22:22Z;Eni wins Iraq oil field deal;;Iraq has given a consortium led by Eni, the Italian oil group, the right to develop its giant Zubair field, in a deal that signals the country’s desire to attract more of the world’s biggest oil companies 40 years after nationalising its oil industry.Tuesday’s breakthrough, which needs cabinet approval, came after Iraq sweetened its terms following the failure of a June auction. It could lead to further foreign investment in a country with the world’s third-largest oil reserves.As part of the agreement, the Iraqi government told the Eni consortium to drop Sinopec, the Chinese state-owned oil company, as a partner.Baghdad has vowed to block Sinopec from its oil resources because of its entry into Kurdistan, the oil-rich semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq. In June Sinopec agreed to a C$8.3bn (US$7.2bn) takeover of Addax, which had a stake in the Kurdish Taq Taq field.Eni and its minority-share partners – Kogas of Korea and Occidental of the US – are only the second group of international oil companies to enter Iraq since it nationalised its industry four decades ago. BP and CNPC were the only companies willing to accept Iraq’s tough fiscal terms in the country’s June auction.Paolo Scaroni, Eni chief executive, told the Financial Times: “Zubair is one of the most important oil fields in the world. It is one of very few that is capable of producing more than 1m barrels a day. Because we are going to Iraq, it means we will not be doing other things.”Mr Scaroni said the project would boost the field’s production from 200,000 barrels per day to 1.125m b/d within seven years.Under the agreement, Eni and its partners will receive $2 for each barrel over 1.125m bpd they are able to pump from the field, which holds reserves of 4bn barrels and is Iraq’s fourth-largest. In the first bidding round, Eni – like many of its peers – refused to accept the $2 payment. Eni had asked for more, but agreed on $2 after Baghdad sweetened other terms that raised the overall value of the contract.Iraq is in talks with other companies that walked away in June. Lukoil of Russia on Tuesday confirmed that it and US partner ConocoPhillips would restart discussions for Iraq’s West Qurna field on Wednesday. Royal Dutch Shell said it was still in talks with Baghdad.
414;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-12T23:34:52Z;Coal-bed methane: Industry whose time has come?;;Converting coal-bed methane into liquefied natural gas is a fledgling industry but one that has attracted heavyweight oil and gas groups to the Australian state of Queensland.Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips of the US, the UK’s BG and Petronas of Malaysia have all made big bets on Queensland CBM – natural gas produced from coal deposits that is known in Australia as coal seam gas – either alone or in partnership with domestic groups such as Santos, Origin Energy and Arrow Energy.If Australia is to fulfil its promise of becoming the world’s dominant LNG supplier within a decade, a claim made by industry executives and analysts in recent months, then CBM will be fundamental to that goal.Most of the CBM is located in the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland’s interior, and once extracted from coal seams it has to be transported hundreds of kilometres overland to the port of Gladstone. From there, the plan is to convert the methane into LNG, which is supercooled to about minus 160 degrees centigrade, so it shrinks in volume and can be transported by tanker to Asia.Joseph Marushack, Australia chief of ConocoPhillips, last month told an Australian LNG conference in Darwin that CBM could account for one-third of Australia’s gas projects by 2020.Queensland’s CBM industry has been a vibrant sector for mergers and acquisitions, marked by friendly and hostile takeover approaches and strategic alliances.ConocoPhillips last year agreed to invest up to A$9.6bn ($8.7bn) to jointly develop CBM with Origin Energy, a group that had fought off a hostile A$13.8bn takeover from BG.BG later acquired Queensland Gas Company in an A$5.6bn deal and then Pure Energy for about A$800m. The two other main groupings are a consortium between Santos and Petronas, and a venture between Shell and Arrow Energy.However, BG this year advanced the industry’s prospects when it signed a deal with CNOOC of China to sell LNG from its planned Gladstone plant. CNOOC said it would buy 3.6m tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years, as well as agreeing to take small stakes in BG’s LNG plant and some of its gas fields. The supply agreement represented about 5.3bn cubic metres of gas a year, roughly 8 per cent of Chinese demand.The preliminary deal, China’s first commitment to gas imports for Queensland CBM, underscored hopes that a new supply route between Gladstone and Asia would soon be open. Singapore, South Korea and Japan are also potential customers for Australia’s CBM and are being actively courted.Tony Regan at Tri-Zen International, a consultancy focused on the oil and gas industry, says that, for years Australia’s CBM was considered a “mom and pop” business, populated by many small independent producers. “But once the majors realised that many of the constraints are manageable, they started to invest heavily and CBM to LNG has become a reality,” he says.Although converting coal bed methane to LNG uses well-established technology, it is yet to be fully proven as a large scale commercial proposition. CBM is different from natural gas in that you need far more wells to extract the gas and it comes in far more slowly.“The verdict thus far is that these are not serious issues. With new technologies, you can get more gas faster,” says Mr Regan. “You still need to remove water [from the underground coal seams] but that is not taking as long as was first thought.”The bigger problem for the multiple groups, however, is that there are too many projects and consolidation is needed.Analysts say two main groupings are likely, although one says that, under a radical plan, the various groups could collectively own the land and infrastructure but independently operate LNG processing systems.David Knox, CEO of Santos, has already held out the olive branch, saying he would welcome “collaborative discussions” with rivals. Earlier this year, he singled out BG, which analysts say has built the most valuable coal seam gas portfolio, and the ConocoPhillips-Origin Energy consortium as the “key ones”.Although the massive North West Shelf Gas Project remains the most valuable LNG asset in Australia and Chevron’s recent “final investment decision” on the Gorgon LNG project, which is also off western Australia, have stolen the headlines, few doubt that CBM will have its day.The problem will be building the infrastructure, the local industry’s capacity to build enough LNG processing trains (systems), and finding contractors and engineers.There is also emerging competition from other parts of the world, with China, Indonesia and India all looking to expand their CBM industries. Finally, developing Queensland’s CBM resources will takes tens of billions of dollars and it is not yet certain that the projects will be signed off.
415;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-09T20:34:41Z;Wall Street ends week on a high note;;Wall Street on Friday recorded its first full week of consecutive gains since November 2006 after strength in technology stocks added to this week’s rally.International Business Machines rose 3 per cent to $125.93 after Barclays upgraded computer hardware companies, saying storage and server demand was picking up.Google also rose 0.4 per cent to $516.25 after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock, citing a potential rebound in advertising. The market initially opened lower as investors mulled over comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said late on Thursday that the central bank could tighten monetary policy as the economic recovery takes hold.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,071.49 and the Nasdaq gained 0.7 per cent to 2,139.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per to a high for the year of 9,864.94. Over the course of the week, the S&P rose 4 per cent - its biggest weekly gain since July. The Dow rose 3.4 per cent and the Nasdaq was 4 per cent higher.Positive economic data, the weak dollar and rising commodity prices pushed stocks higher this week. After Wednesday’s close, Alcoa set a positive tone for the third-quarter earnings season by posting a profit and, on Thursday, leading US retailers reported their first monthly sales gain since September 2008.Bruce Shalett, founder of the Wynston Hill Capital boutique investment bank, said: “There’s reason to feel cautiously optimistic. The retail data that came out resonated very positively with investors who are hoping upon hope for reasons to believe that the recovery is sustainable.”Citigroup was in focus on Friday after confirming it would sell its controversial Phibro commodities business to Occidental Petroleum. Occidental said its net investment in the business would total about $250m and the deal is expected to help deflect political anger over a potential $100m pay-out for its star trader Andrew Hall. While financial stocks were broadly up, Citi shares lost 0.4 per cent to $4.63.Government-backed mortgage lenders also weighed on the sector. Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said late on Thursday that the mortgage groups might need further aid from the US Treasury. Fannie Mae was down 4 per cent to $1.43 and Freddie Mac lost 3.9 per cent to $1.71.Shares in both companies fell on Wednesday, in spite of a broad rally in the financial sector, after reports suggested they were working on a programme to help independent mortgage banks get access to short-term credit for home loans.Retreating commodity prices hit mining and industrial stocks in early trading on Friday.Newmont Mining suffered further after speculation that the company could be preparing a hostile bid for Australia’s Newcrest Mining. Newmont shares were down 1.1 per cent at $46.50.Chevron said late on Thursday that higher oil prices would lead to significantly better profits in the third quarter than the previous one. The shares were up 1.8 per cent at $72.76.Such optimism did not spread to its rivals and ExxonMobil trailed the market, gaining 0.3 per cent to $69.927. ConocoPhillips lost 1.2 per cent to $50.78 after announcing it would temporarily shut down parts of its refinery in Texas for maintenance.A flurry of deal activity helped lift sentiment. Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues, announced it had bought I-Flow for $324m. Kimberly-Clark gained 0.3 per cent to $59.23, while shares in I-Flow, which sells surgical products such as catheters, rose 7 per cent to $12.58.Sunrise Senior Living, the retirement home group that warned this year of possible bankruptcy, agreed to sell 21 of its assisted living communities to an affiliate of rival Brookdale Senior Living for $204m.Sunrise shares rose 44.6 per cent to $4.77.
416;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-08T19:03:44Z;US oil majors;;It seems Warren Buffett bought the wrong oil company. His multi-billion dollar loss in ConocoPhillips was not just a matter of misreading the commodity bubble but coveting its low earnings multiple and forgetting that “price is what you pay but value is what you get”.After spending aggressively for years, Conoco has now made a U-turn by promising to shed assets, cut debt and boost its dividend. In other words, it is trying to emulate the capital discipline of ExxonMobil, the company Mr Buffett probably should have bought. Exxon paid 2.4 times as much cash through dividends and buy-backs as it spent on capital investment over the past three years, a ratio four times as high as Conoco. In fairness, peers such as Total, BP, Shell and Chevron divvied up cash in much the same way as Conoco, but none put the money to quite such poor use.To put Conoco’s value destruction into perspective, consider that Exxon’s shareholders could have taken the cash they received since 2005 and bought all of Conoco twice over, with change to spare. Going the other way, Conoco’s shareholders received enough to buy about 10 per cent of Exxon.Is this fair considering Exxon is the world’s largest corporation? More or less. Conoco’s cumulative exploration spending over eight years was actually higher than Exxon as it tried to drill its way into the same league. Now, having taken a huge write-off on a 2006 acquisition, it has by far the highest leverage of any of the supermajors.No prize for guessing which has the prettiest balance sheet and is the only supermajor to boost exploration spending substantially this year as others retrench. Just like any Buffett disciple would do, Exxon was fearful when others were greedy and is now being greedy when others are fearful.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
417;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-07T23:03:31Z;Conoco plans to sell $10bn of assets;;ConocoPhillips, the third-biggest oil company in the US, on Wednesday announced plans to sell $10bn worth of assets over the next two years and cut its 2010 capital spending by $1.5bn as it seeks to rebuild investor confidence.Conoco said the asset sales may include oil and natural gas properties, as well as refineries. It plans to use the proceeds to cut its debt, accelerating a return to its stated target debt-to-capital ratio of 20-25 per cent.It also announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, up 6 per cent.Investors have pulled back from the company since the start of the year, when Conoco said falling commodity prices had forced it to take a $34bn writedown on the reduction in asset values.At the time, the company announced 1,300 job cuts and that it would scale back capital expenditures to $12.5bn this year from $15.3bn in 2008.Jim Mulva, chairman and chief executive, said the company would replace reserves and increase production from a “reduced, but more strategic, base”.“These actions are consistent with our objectives of creating shareholder value and improving financial flexibility while pursuing our long-term strategic initiatives,” Mr Mulva said.“This plan capitalises on our large resource base and our strong portfolio of projects, while providing flexibility for potential changes in business conditions.”Conoco is eager to convince investors its days of rapid growth through sometimes expensive acquisitions are over, and it is now focusing on organic growth.Conoco had spent the least of any of the big oil companies on exploration or development as a percentage of total capital expenditure over the past six years, according to Bernstein Research. But it has spent the most on acquisitions – $80bn over eight years.The company said yesterday it planned to replace reserves through organic growth, with upstream production growing from a reduced base as a result of the asset sales.
418;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-02T14:53:35Z;Larry Nichols, Devon Energy: Independent boss is happy with his lot;;"Larry Nichols is not your ordinary chief executive. The head of Devon Energy, the biggest US independent, arrives back from lunch alone and walks into a conference room without any handlers. There is no public relations person. He has no briefing notes. And no pretences.When I ask what he is reading, he does not pluck from thin air some classic to look intellectual. He admits he is not reading anything and has no favourite book. “I used to be a reader; life got too busy,” he says. And he is following nobody when it comes to getting through this crisis.Whereas most oil and gas companies have cut back on spending and staff, Mr Nichols has continued to fund long-term strategic projects, such as its exploration programmes in the Gulf of Mexico and the Canadian oil sands, despite the economic downturn, credit squeeze and plunging commodity prices.And he is not defensive about his counter-cyclical spending. At 66, he has been through enough slumps to position Devon to prosper during the good times and survive the bad.“We are deficit-spending a bit this year to keep activity going.” With a BBB+ credit rating, he believes Devon’s balance sheet is strong enough to borrow without putting the company at risk.For Mr Nichols, the downturn is about maintaining staff, drilling to keep crews engaged, protecting leases that will be lost if their parcels have not been drilled before they expire, and gaining knowledge.“When the upturn comes, you fully understand your portfolio, and you can fully attack,” Mr Nichols says. “We recognise that, just as things don’t go up for ever, they don’t go down for ever.” Therefore, Devon is keeping all its talent, looking through the recession to what it will need in 2010 or 2011. “There is no doubt in my mind that there will again be huge demand for geoscientists and all the other talent that runs our business,” he says.Deficit spending notwithstanding, Mr Nichols has reduced overall spending – cutting the drilling budget by half in keeping with the 50 per cent fall in oil and gas revenues. But he is still drilling, while others, such as Chesapeake, are shutting down natural gas production, and many more, like ConocoPhillips, are laying off staff.“We have frozen everyone’s salary, and I mean everyone’s.” The big perks that others were using to entice staff from competitors were never handed out by Devon, so they do not have to be revoked.More importantly, Devon has spent the past two years unloading uncompetitive assets: during the “gold rush”, Devon sold $3bn pre-tax in Africa assets to pay down debt. “If you have a property to dispose of, do it when prices are high and everyone loves all properties.”Despite this well-timed move, he does not want to sound smug about preparing for a crisis that has been deeper than anyone predicted: “We did not know this recession was coming, but we knew sooner or later one would come,” he says.Mr Nichols obtained a geology degree from Princeton University, but then set his sights on a legal career and obtained a law degree from the University of Michigan. He worked as a law clerk for chief justice Earl Warren and Justice Tom Clark in the US supreme court.Later he served as special assistant to William Rehnquist, assistant US attorney general in the US Department of Justice.But when his father, John Nichols, called him in 1970 to ask for help, the younger Nichols agreed to help establish the energy company that became Devon. His father, a certified accountant, had run several oil enterprises, but he wanted his son on board for what would turn out to be his biggest and most successful venture. Mr Nichols smiles as he remembers those early days.“We were a tiny company, with four and a half employees – we shared a receptionist,” he recalls. A director from the start, Mr Nichols became president in 1976, chief executive in 1980 and chairman in 2000. The staff grew with him, now numbering more than 5,500.His Washington DC experience is an asset when trying to influence policy. “What you read in high school about how our government works is not exactly how our government works, I regret to say.”Mr Nichols also knew that he could not rely on congressional hearings to educate lawmakers, because congressmen do not want to learn with television cameras watching. Rather he needed to meet individually with congressional leaders and their staff. This has proved especially helpful to Mr Nichols as chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the 400-member national trade association.He spends a lot of time in Washington DC, trying to educate lawmakers and the new administration. “A good number of people in the new administration are eager to learn,” he says. Then adds: “There are some lost causes.”It is a good year for Mr Nichols to lead the Institute because he is not sniffing out distressed assets, unlike others who entered the downturn from a similar position of strength. “We’re very comfortable with the size we are.” Devon has never bought a company to get bigger. And, with 27,000 undrilled well locations, he is pleased with the company’s assets and financial position to exploit them.Devon’s net debt to capital ratio was 34 per cent at the end of the first quarter of 2009. Cash in hand was $397m and unused credit facilities totalled more than $2.3bn.Mr Nichols does his thinking about the long-term direction of the company while flying, driving to and from work and after 5pm, when the phone stops ringing: “Those few moments you have alone,” he says.To relax, Mr Nichols hikes. He takes one trip each year with his wife and friends. He would like to have two or three vacations a year but is still too busy. Without dropping any hints, Mr Nichols notes that he has been working for some time on a succession plan.His father passed away last year, at age 93, as chairman emeritus. And none of his three children are in the oil business to take control over the company he and his father founded.Nonetheless, he has managed to maintain the feel of a family company, chatting with staff as he walks the halls and goes to lunch.He does not have regular sit-downs aimed at grooming promising executives: “It is totally informal and constant.” He can only hope Devon will stay that way."
419;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-02T14:53:35Z;Plunging demand, price volatility;;It has been a tough year for natural gas. Prices fell for most of the year as the global recession hit demand. Even as oil prices rose during the summer thanks to the production cuts by the Opec oil cartel, gas prices remained stubbornly low, widening the gap between oil and gas to levels not seen in two decades.The fall in industrial demand was accompanied by a cool and rainy summer in the US that kept air conditioners off, reducing demand for electricity. The US generated about 20 per cent of its electricity from natural and other gas sources in 2007, according to US government figures – similar to nuclear power, but less than half the amount from coal-fired generation.The drop in overall energy demand created a glut of gas, with excess gas filling storage tanks in the US and eventually those in Europe as well – Europe’s reserves had been depleted by the dispute over gas prices between Moscow and Kiev last winter.The US department of energy, predicts stored gas will reach 3,800bn cubic feet by the end of October, its highest level ever. New storage space has been added since last year, but knowing exactly how much room is available in old underground oil fields, salt caverns and aquifers used as storage facilities is tricky.“It’s not like a crude oil storage tank where you have a fixed and knowable volume,” says Tancred Lidderdale, EIA senior economist. “For natural gas you know it’s full when you can’t push any more in.”On the Texas and Oklahoma plains, rigs no longer able to make a profit have been dismantled – land-based rig use in the US declined 56 per cent compared to the previous year.But even cuts in production were not enough to stop the price slide. Without an Opec-type cartel to make voluntarily cuts to supplies, prices remained low. This summer, gas traded at a quarter of the value of oil.In September, however, gas prices rebounded. The approach of winter may have heartened gas traders, but the principal reason for the rise in prices was the positive signals about the state of the world economy.Nevertheless, traders warn that price volatility is likely to continue.Adam Sieminski, analyst at Deutsche Bank, acknowledged the price rally, but cautioned: “Fundamentals remain weak and precariously depend on the impact of sinking cash [spot] prices as storage rises.”A global glut will mean an increase in liquefied natural gas heading to the US, one of the few markets flexible enough to be able to accommodate the volumes. But this foreign gas will have to compete with domestic gas, which is becoming increasingly available from unconventional fields.Nathan Piper, analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, says new technology improves efficiency at wells pumping gas from unconventional, tricky reservoirs – so called tight gas – improving profit margins.“Tight gas will be taken in preference to LNG [liquified natural gas], as it is a domestic source,” he says.In the longer term, low prices, the development of alternative sources, investment in wind and solar technology and less obvious constraints such as planning permission delays mean investing in bringing LNG to the US market will be a tougher proposition than analysts had believed.LNG is the method companies use to super-cool natural gas, turning it into a liquid that can be transported by tanker to markets far away. Much of the world’s gas is still transported by pipeline, but the LNG market is growing, as fields close to big demand centres age and production needs to come from further away.Frank Harris, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, admits that he has had to trim forecasts for US LNG imports for the past two years. “The days of developing an LNG project in Africa on the assumption that volumes could always go to the US, and get a [price] that made the economics work, look to have gone,” he says.Instead of the US, the hot destination for LNG in the long term appears to be the Pacific basin. With its location and solid investment environment, Australia looks set to become the lead provider to that market.In September, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil, announced – after decades of development – that they would invest A$43bn ($38bn) in LNG facilities at Australia’s giant Gorgon field. Almost in the same breath, Chevron added that it would decide within 18 months whether to nearly double the size of the project.By 2015, Gorgon is expected to provide 4 per cent of the world’s LNG. Nikos Tsafos, analyst at PFC Energy, believes the country is likely to surpass Qatar as the world’s biggest supplier in the early 2020s.Mr Harris says China is going to be critical to the next wave of LNG projects in Australia and elsewhere in Asia. He says: “The issue is that as China realises it has leverage with the projects, it will squeeze very hard on the [economic] terms it extracts for purchasing the LNG.”But without purchase agreements in place, most companies are unable to invest the billions of dollars needed to develop LNG facilities.In spite of China’s growing leverage, the expected growth in long-term demand from Asia has kept investors interested in gas projects and mitigated at least some of the fear inspired by the current rather gloomy price environment.As well as continuing to develop more traditional sources, investors have also been making deals to developing projects that extract gas from trickier reservoirs, for example those within shale or coal deposits. These have traditionally been dominated by smaller companies because the scale and profits were not large enough for the big players. That has now changed as technology has improved.In the past year, BP, the UK oil and gas group, and Statoil of Norway have entered US shale by buying assets from Chesapeake, the US gas producer, in deals exceeding $5bn. The height of the frenzy for unconventional gas came when ConocoPhillips of the US outbid BG, of the UK, to develop gas trapped in coal beds together with Australia’s Origin in an eye-watering A$9.6bn ($8.4bn) deal.Nevertheless, its supporters maintain that unconventional sources are the sector to invest in. That is especially true, says one executive, if the projects are close to their market with infrastructure and delivery systems already in place.Investors appear to agree. Several natural gas companies have seen their shares fall far less sharply than one might expect given the tumble in gas prices. BG, the UK-based company, is one example, says Peter Hitchens, analyst at Panmure Gordon. He says it stood “head and shoulders” above its peers as one of the best performers of 2008.As the US and China – and many countries in between – look to improve their carbon footprints, gas also has the edge over oil because of its cleaner-burning properties. According to the US department of energy, natural gas emits less carbon dioxide on a per Btu (British thermal units) basis than other fossil fuels.Some analysts even go so far as to say the US should consider tapping its vast reserves of natural gas to power everything it can, including cars. Natural gas powered vehicles in the US generally belong to municipal fleets and are far less numerous than in countries such as Thailand, where many drivers use gas because it is cheaper than petrol.But with gas trading at a quarter of the price of oil and the Washington looking to reduce its dependence on foreign oil while improving its environmental credentials, the idea of gas-powered cars is not as far fetched as it seemed a few years ago.That would please Jim Hackett, chief executive of Anadarko, the US oil and gas company. He espouses switching from oil to gas, despite his company’s greater interests in oil.“We speak against oil and transportation fuels, to the extent that it can be replaced by natural gas, both because natural gas prices will be lower, and because they emit less, and importantly, because they give us more energy security, since more than 97 per cent of the gas is produced domestically,” he said in a recent television interview.
420;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-02T14:53:35Z;Alaska: Doubts raised over demand for pipeline;;On August 20, the Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority was forced to cancel a conference designed to showcase its large natural gas deposits and promote a $30bn pipeline to carry the energy to the rest of the US.At a time when the world is increasingly concerned about energy security, the organisers had expected companies would be eager to investigate opportunities created by its 35,000bn cubic feet of natural gas.But the economic downturn and plunging natural gas prices have hit the industry so hard that the Authority is going to have to fly out to individual companies this year.“It would have been nice to show off Alaska from the home field, but manufacturers have tightened belts and aren’t travelling as much for conferences and industry events,’’ explains Harold Heinze, conference organiser and ANGDA chief executive.In going out into the field, the Authority still hopes it can drum up interest ahead of the open bidding planned in 2010 to secure customer commitments to use the 3,500 mile pipelines being planned.Two competing pipeline projects are being proposed – one by TransCanada and ExxonMobil and the other by Denali, a company owned by BP and ConocoPhillips.But the Alaskan authorities have said the two projects might have to merge to make a pipeline a reality.The bidding process, known as “open season’’, will make clear whether there is enough interest in two.“The open season can dictate the size of the project,’’ says Bill Popp, president and chief executive of the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation. “This could be an important step that may result in the projects merging.’’For, despite a long-held belief that the rest of the US will need Alaska’s gas, those interested have to be looking eight to 10 years ahead in order to access the gas, as it will take that long to get a pipeline up and running.Many companies that would normally be interested have been hit so hard by the economic downturn and natural gas prices falling to a 7.5-year low that they are unable to look that far ahead.The US government, which could provide some leadership, is also unlikely to look that far ahead.“That’s always been the problem – political leaders tend to take a short-term view,’’ says Charles Swanson, Houston office managing partner for Ernst & Young.“If the country is truly looking at energy supplies in the long term, then it should be looking at investing in the Alaska pipeline.’’Mr Popp remains hopeful. “There is still an opportunity for Alaska gas to hit the market,’’ he says.But he does recognise that the chances of that happening have also been undermined by new estimates that the lower 48 US states, which would receive the gas, now have 100 years worth of natural gas recoverable from shale rock because of new technology and expertise.This is up from estimates just three years ago of 30 years of supply.Mr Popp notes there are some negatives attached to producing natural gas from shale, such as issues over water rights and contamination.Besides, he says, Alaska gas is better quality, containing ethane and propane, while shale gas is only methane: “Those have a value that shale gas doesn’t have.’’While there has been some concern over the use of water to fracture the shale rock to recover natural gas, the industry does not consider this an impediment to increasing production.And this leaves Mr Popp only “cautiously optimistic’’ that the pipeline will go through in the next few years.He latches on to the interest of the oil majors as proof that there is value in the project, noting that these companies make conservative decisions aimed at the long term. He singled out ExxonMobil’s commitment, in particular, as proof the project is worth pursuing:“ExxonMobil is not a company that makes rash decisions. It and TransCanada have the experience, expertise, and financial capability to undertake this project,’’ says Rich Kruger, president of ExxonMobil Production Company.“We have on-the-ground knowledge of Alaska and Canada, experience working in the Arctic, a strong history of technology and innovation, and the proven ability to build and operate projects of enormous scale in the most challenging environments.’’There is no doubt the pipeline can be built. But there has to be someone willing to buy the gas to make it worthwhile. Next year’s bidding should bring some clarity to the project.
421;COP;Conocophillips;2009-10-02T14:53:35Z;Coal seam methane: Technology turns canary killer into profit centre;;"Methane gas trapped in coal seams has been a hazard for the mining industry throughout its history. It was why canaries were taken down mines, and is still responsible for terrible disasters today; particularly in China, where every year thousands of miners are killed in accidents.Yet in the past decade, the industry has woken up to the potential of coal bed methane as a usable energy source, and there has been a flood of investment into the sector.Exploiting coal bed methane reserves presents some formidable technical challenges, but its potential is vast. It is likely that even the recent interest has done no more than scratch the surface of what will be possible worldwide. Coal bed methane could become an important source of energy supply for many countries, and China above all.Like much “unconventional” gas – that is, gas not held in standard reservoir rocks – coal bed methane suffers from the problem of low production rates, meaning that not much gas comes out of each well.As a result, thousands of wells may have to be drilled to develop a large field.Coal bed methane also often comes associated with large volumes of water. That water has to be managed, and often needs to be treated. Typically, a well will at first produce a lot of water and not much gas, and then as it is kept running the water volume will decline and the gas volume increase.These problems are compounded if, as several companies are planning, the methane is to be processed into liquefied natural gas, super-cooled to -160°C so it can be shipped in tankers.Necessity is the mother of invention, however, and western companies have been forced to find solutions, because so many conventional gas resources are inaccessible.The coal bed methane reserves that have attracted the most attention in the past couple of years are in Australia, a country that boasts an unusual pairing of attractions. It has a regulatory climate that generally welcomes investment, and is relatively close – compared to many other resource-rich countries – to the lucrative and fast-growing markets of Asia.Australia was one of the active markets in the world for oil and gas mergers and acquisitions last year, as international groups piled in to secure coal bed methane assets.BG Group of the UK, ConocoPhillips of the US and Petronas of Malaysia all signed significant deals in the coal bed methane region of Queensland, in north-east Australia, and all plan to convert the gas to LNG for export.The challenge in using coal bed methane to supply an LNG plant is managing the flow from the large numbers of wells to provide the steady input that the plant needs.Industry experts believe those problems, which are more logistical than technical, are surmountable. Hopes that the first LNG deliveries from Queensland could begin in 2014 do not seem unrealistic.Meanwhile, countries such as India and China are also seeking to develop their reserves.As an added incentive, because methane is a greenhouse gas, making productive use of it rather than simply venting it into the air qualifies for emissions reduction credits in the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism, enhancing the economics of some coal bed methane projects.India has been offering coal beds with potential for gas development in the blocks it offers for investment by domestic and international companies.Prashant Modi, president and chief operating officer of Great Eastern Energy, a London-listed company developing coal bed methane in India, thinks the level of interest in licences demonstrates that coal bed methane “has the potential to be a major source of gas supply in India”.Interest has been shown by companies such as BP of the UK and Arrow Energy of Australia, a joint venture partner of Royal Dutch/ Shell.Mr Modi adds: “Being heavily dependent on imported fuels will also help the development of coal bed methane in India.”The government has suggested the country has about 4,600bn cubic metres of coal bed methane: as much as the total proved gas reserves of Norway, the Netherlands and the UK put together, and enough to supply India’s consumption at its present rate for 120 years.Even that is dwarfed, however, by China’s coal bed methane reserves, however. These have been estimated at 36,000bn cubic metres.If they can be developed, the reserves would make China one of the most gas-rich countries in the world, ahead of both Iran and Qatar, and not far short of Russia’s 43,300bn cubic metres of reserves.China has set a target of producing 2bn cubic metres of coal bed methane in 2010, which would still be less than 3 per cent of the country’s gas consumption.The industry is hampered by the distance between the reserves and the main centres of gas consumption, and the lack of an adequate pipeline infrastructure.Nevertheless, China’s focus on coal bed methane has already shown some benefits. There were 778 gas-related accident deaths in China’s mines last year; still a shockingly high number, but down from 2,171 deaths in 2005."
422;COP;Conocophillips;2009-09-21T16:31:00Z;Green Dragon looks to ConocoPhillips tie-up for sales lift;;Green Dragon, the Aim-quoted specialist in Chinese coal bed methane gas, is looking forward to accelerating sales next year following its joint venture with ConocoPhillips.The comments came as it reported pre-tax losses reduced from $13m to $10.9m (£6.7m) on sales ahead from $2.4m to $18.7m for the six months to June.Randeep Grewal, the chairman and chief executive who has a stake of 82 per cent, said the company was “significantly undervalued” compared with its peer group, not least since the the joint venture with ConocoPhillips, which was announced a month ago.Green Dragon, which has been operating in China since the mid-1990s, floated on Aim in August 2006, raising $25m at $5.56 a share. It has since raised further funds through placings, bonds and most recently a rights issue in March. At Monday’s unchanged closing price of $6.55 a share, the market capitalisation was $711m.The company in June indicated plans to increase the free float and transfer to the full list in London or the Hong Kong stock exchange had been deferred. Mr Grewal said Aim had improved its visibility and it now had an “impeccable” record.Over the past three years the market had matured, particularly in Australia, where producers were targeting the Asian market, he said. However, higher values on the Australian stock exchange were not being reflected in the share price.On an industry standard valuation, ConocoPhillips paid $33.20 per barrel of oil equivalent when it took over Origin Energy in Australia a year ago. Green Dragon’s probable, possible and proved reserves are valued at $1.98 per boe.Under the farm-out agreement with Green Dragon, ConocoPhillips will make an initial payment of $20m to Greka Energy, Green Dragon’s wholly owned subsidiary that holds coal bed methane licences in four Chinese provinces.ConocoPhillips will also fund up to $30m of capital expenditure and can elect to continue with a second phase of development, paying $120m to acquire 50 per cent of Greka’s interest in three of its six Chinese coal bed methane production sharing contracts.
423;COP;Conocophillips;2009-09-16T20:48:58Z;Energy sector lifts US stocks;;A major oil discovery off the coast of Africa and positive economic data helped US stocks rally to fresh highs for the year on Wednesday.The energy sector propelled the market upward from the opening bell after a consortium of oil companies led by Anadarko Petroleum said it had made an oil find near Sierra Leone. The discovery potentially opens up a new, 1,100 km-wide, multi-billion-barrel oil frontier in west Africa.Shares in the Texas-based company rose 9.6 per cent to $64.85. ConocoPhillips also gained 1 per cent to $46.79 and Chevron rose 1.1 per cent to $72.45 after optimism seeped across the rest of the sector.Higher petrol costs pushed up the consumer price index and US industrial production in August for the second consecutive month, adding to investor hopes that a recovery was under way.While the consumer price index was higher than expected, the core CPI was in line with forecasts and helped to calm investor concerns over inflation. Following an afternoon rally, all of the leading indices closed up more than 1 per cent, notching up three straight days of gains. The S&P 500 climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,068.76, closing at its highest level since October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent at 9,791.71, while the Nasdaq rose 1.5 per cent to 2,133.15.Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said the market had also broken through significant levels. “Now there’s really no resistance,” he said. “Overseas markets were all up across the board and it just continued over here. Economic news this morning was also better, from the CPI to the industrial production numbers.”Financial stocks added to the gains from the energy sector. Citigroup rebounded after falling nearly 9 per cent on Tuesday. After reports that the government might offload its 34 per cent stake in the bank, it emerged late on Tuesday that Citi had also raised $5bn in government-guaranteed bonds. The move to tap the emergency facility just before it expires could complicate attempts to persuade the government to reduce its stake. The shares rose 1.9 per cent to $4.20. Genworth Financial also pushed the sector higher, gaining 9.1 per cent to $13.14 a day after it priced a common share offering.Other stocks in the sector also climbed on optimism about economic recovery. Wednesday’s positive data added to comments by Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, on Tuesday that the US recession was “very likely over”. Bank of America was up 2.7 per cent at $17.25 and JPMorgan rose 3.4 per cent to $44.65.The materials sector also contributed to the market advance as commodity prices gained momentum and gold approached an 18-month high. Alcoa rose 3.4 per cent to $14.47, after closing 8.1 per cent higher at $13.99 on Tuesday.Deal news lifted sentiment. Adobe Systems said on Tuesday it was buying Omniture, the ad-measurement company, for $1.8bn in an effort to diversify as its core software business declines. The all-cash deal will allow Adobe to embed Omniture’s measurement services into the web content that designers create with its software. Adobe fell 6.4 per cent to $33.35 while Omniture soared 26.3 per cent to $21.88.Bank of America analysts upgraded Amazon.com to “buy” from “neutral”, who said the world’s biggest online retailer would be able to maintain its position ahead of rivals. The shares rose 8.6 per cent to $90.70.Verizon Communications dragged the telecoms services index into negative territory after UBS downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $30.41.Healthcare stocks also came under scrutiny after Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee, unveiled the long-awaited bill on healthcare reform. Wellpoint rose 3.2 per cent to $54.86 and UnitedHealth gained 5.7 per cent to $29.29.In other news, Pilgrim’s Pride, the biggest maker of chicken products in the US, agreed to sell a 64 per cent stake to Brazilian meat producer JBS for $800m. Shares in the company, which is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, rose 10.2 per cent to $5.53.
424;COP;Conocophillips;2009-09-14T20:56:34Z;Utility stocks help Wall Street recover;;Utility stocks helped Wall Street recover from early losses on Monday after investors feared a trade dispute between the US and China would spark a pull-back.Shares in AES, the power company, rose 4.5 per cent to $14.79 after reports that China’s sovereign wealth fund was eyeing a stake in the group. The S&P utility index gained 1.6 per cent, helping to reassure investors even after a row erupted between the two countries.Late on Friday US President Barack Obama had said he would impose a duty of 35 per cent on Chinese tyre imports. Beijing accused Washington of “rampant protectionism”, saying it would investigate imports of US poultry and vehicles.Goodyear Tire & Rubber, the biggest US tyremaker, climbed 3 per cent to $17.78. The Ohio company has been badly hit by the recession and cut 5,000 jobs in February after axing 4,000 staff in the second half of last year. Cooper Tire & Rubber, which manufactures tyres mainly in the US but also in China, rose 7.1 per cent to $15.60.Pilgrim’s Pride, the biggest maker of chicken products in the US, fell 2.3 per cent to $5, while Tyson Foods, the world’s biggest meat processor, fell 2.4 per cent to $12.45.Mr Obama’s speech on regulatory reform on Monday had little immediate effect on the market and stocks continued to fluctuate until rallying late in the day.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,049.34, while the technology-focused Nasdaq gained 0.5 per cent to 2,091.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 9,626.80, powered by a 4.6 per cent gain in General Electric after the shares broke through the $15 milestone to $15.35.“People are taking a little bit of protection but they’re not willing to give up on the market yet,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Canaccord Adams. He said the market had declined in early trading because investors were taking money off the table after last week’s rally and guarding themselves in response to the trade dispute with China.“Markets have been overbought and they’re due for a pull-back at some point, it’s just a question of when that is,” he said.Financial stocks led the market lower in early trading. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-prize winning US economist, had added to concerns about the economy when he said in an interview on Sunday that underlying problems still lingered in the the US banking system after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.After early losses, Bank of America crept up 0.1 per cent to $16.99, while Citigroup lost 2 per cent to $4.52. MB Financial, which operates mainly in the Chicago area, rose 5.5 per cent to $17.97 after it announced a $150m share offering.Materials stocks also helped the market. Sealed Air, the bubble-wrap maker, added 5.9 per cent to $20.16 after its biggest intraday gain since May on an upgrade from BofA.The brokerage raised its rating on Avery Dennison, the world’s largest label maker, helping boost the shares 6 per cent to $34.55.Sprint Nextel, after soaring 20 per cent, was up 10.1 per cent to $4.15 after reports that Deutsche Telekom was considering a bid for the mobile operator.At the weekend, Cadbury reiterated its stance on the takeover bid from Kraft Foods, saying Kraft’s low-growth business model was an “unappealing prospect”.BofA analysts later issued a note saying the British confectioner was unlikely to receive a competing bid. Kraft closed flat at $26.11.Falling commodity prices had initially hit the market but following the afternoon rally ExxonMobil was unchanged at $70. ConocoPhillips gained 1.4 per cent to $46.59 even though oil remained below the $70 level.Following a good performance last week on the back of rising metal prices, Alcoa was unchanged at $12.94. A downgrade from HSBC had initially pushed the stock lower.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Alexza Pharmaceuticals fell 11.7 per cent to $2.56 after it reported disappointing results from the trial of its migraine drug.Salix Pharmaceuticals soared 51.1 per cent to $20.22 after it said Rifaximin, used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, had met the goals of its latest trials.
425;COP;Conocophillips;2009-09-02T20:36:32Z;Downbeat jobs report drag on Wall Street;;US stocks dipped in and out of the red before ending lower on Wednesday following the release of downbeat data on job losses, prompting speculation that the market’s correction had begun.The ADP employment report suggested that private employers cut more jobs in August than had been expected, which continued to weigh on the market after it opened lower for the third consecutive day.Wall Street had initially taken some comfort from the Challenger jobs report, which showed that the pace of US job losses had slowed.This was quickly counterbalanced by the ADP data, which said companies cut 298,000 posts in August. Analysts had expected 250,000 job losses.Disappointing news on factory orders also offset better-than-expected data on non-farm productivity.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 994.75. On Tuesday, the index fell below 1,000 for the first time since the middle of August. The Nasdaq fell 0.1 per cent to 1,967.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 per cent to 9,280.67.“Even though the ADP numbers were a little bit disappointing, it is still consistent with improving data so I think what we’re going to see . . . is the market trying to stabilise over the next day or so before we move into the long weekend,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.Energy companies were some of the market’s best performers following BP’s announcement that it had made a significant oil discovery at its Tiber Prospect in the US waters of the Gulf of Mexico.ConocoPhillips, one of BP’s partners in the Tiber, closed up 0.4 per cent at $44.34. The materials sector also fed the market’s gains after the price of gold climbed to a three-month high during the day.As the mood of uncertainty persisted, investors headed towards the consumer staples sector later in the day. Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort, was one of the main beneficiaries, rising 5.9 per cent to $46.39. Coca-Cola climbed 2.3 per cent to $49.8.After leading Tuesday’s decline, the S&P financials group flirted with gains for brief periods before closing down 1 per cent.Wells Fargo rose 0.5 per cent to $26.09, after Bloom-berg reported the bank planned to pay back bail-out money to the US government without issuing new shares.The San Francisco-based lender had been at the centre of a sell-off in the financial sector on Tuesday as fears grew about the health of the banking system.But concern still lingered. Citigroup closed up 0.4 per cent at $4.56 and Bank of America was up 1.1 per cent at $16.27.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suffered after the Mortgage Bankers Association proposed that Congress transform the government-controlled mortgage lenders into several smaller privately-held companies backed by government guarantees.Fannie Mae was down 13.8 per cent at $1.37, while Freddie Mac retreated 13.7 per cent to $1.64.The industrial sector also showed losses as investors digested the stream of mixed economic data.General Electric was down 1.1 per cent at $13.20, while US Steel Corporation was down 0.6 per cent at $41.71.Textron, which owns a network of aircraft, defence, industrial and finance businesses, escaped the sector’s decline and closed 12.2 per cent up at $17.39 after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs.However, homebuilders maintained losses even as the broader market wavered.Hovnanian fell 7.4 per cent at $4.65, while Standard Pacific was down 1.2 per cent at $3.26. The stocks had enjoyed a rally a week previously when US home sales data for July came in above forecast.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Walgreen fell 0.7 per cent to $33.81 after the drugstore chain announced that comparable front-end sales had fallen 1.3 per cent in August as shoppers cut back on discretionary items.After a rally on Tuesday on news of trials of seasonal flu vaccines, Novavax fell 10.7 per cent to $5.94 on a downgrade.The utilities sector remained in the red for most of the day.
426;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US energy industry stages rally against climate bill;;"The US energy industry sought on Tuesday to put a human face on its lobbying effort against climate change legislation under consideration by Congress, staging the first of a series of “energy citizen” rallies across the country.More than 3,000 people packed the lunchtime demonstration at a Houston stadium, mostly from energy companies including Chevron, Anadarko Petroleum and ConocoPhillips, which encouraged staff to participate.Their goal is to show Congress that US citizens – not just faceless companies – object to the proposed Waxman-Markey legislation, which favours renewables over conventional energy.”They’re dictating a solution that will damage the economy,” said Kent Baggett, a ConocoPhillips employee.The orderly crowd wore bright yellow T-shirts marked ”Energy Citizen” on the front – the name of the nonprofit organisation formed to organise the rallies. On the back were phrases such as, ”It’s the JOB climate stupid” and “Think job losses and $4 gas.”A high school band and cheer squad entertained the crowd before leaders of various chambers of congress and members of the Houston Astros baseball team took to the stage.Jim Hackett, chief executive of Anadarko, was the highest profile energy executive at the gathering, yet he was not asked to speak in order to underline the event as a people’s effort.Yet the rally was sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s national trade organisation, as well as truckers, farmers, and others impacted by high energy prices.""Energy Citizen is not against climate legislation,"" said Cathy Landry, API spokeswoman. ""Energy Citizen is against bad climate legislation.""Drayton McLane, the Astros’ chief executive, said if the bill passed in its current form, 180,000 energy jobs would be lost in the US. He urged Americans to contact Congressional representatives to urge better legislation: ""So much is at stake.""A film featured Trace Adkins, the country music star who spent 10 years in the industry, saying: ""We want our representatives to pass laws that make life better, not harder.""The mere mention of Waxman-Markey drew boos from the crowd, which chanted, ""Save our jobs.""""You wrote 1,100 pages of junk,"" said Harry Alford, president of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, to wild applause. ""Tear up that 1,100 pages and start over.""""The economy now already is so fragile,"" said Tiffany Young, a teacher in attendance who heard about the rally from a relative in the energy industry. ""To throw something like this into the mix would be disastrous.""On the sidelines, Mr Hackett, wearing a T-shirt that read ""High prices, empty wallets, no jobs"", said studies had shown that 2.2 jobs will be lost for every job created and pointed to ethanol to underline how government-subsidised energy policies do not work.The market, he said, recognises the value of natural gas, which has the lowest carbon levels of conventional fuels, as a bridge until alternatives become economic and scaleable. Yet the legislation does nothing to promote it, he said. ""This is really an answer here that works for everybody."" He hopes the Senate will listen."
427;COP;Conocophillips;2009-08-18T07:47:41Z;GDF Suez seeks foothold in LNG project;;GDF Suez has joined a growing list of global energy groups seeking a foothold in Australia’s natural gas industry after striking a deal to develop one of the world’s first floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.The French power utility has agreed to pay up to US$370m to take a 60 per cent stake in three fields in the Bonaparte Basin in the Timor Sea owned by Santos, the Australian oil and gas group.More than 10 LNG projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea are being developed by the world’s largest energy groups, including Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, Conoco-Phillips and BG Group. Australia and Papua New Guinea are ideally placed to service rising energy demand for Asian customers.Not all projects are likely to be completed because of prohibitive costs, while others being developed in adjacent locations are likely to be consolidated.However, the Gorgon project off the coast of Western Australia, one of the world’s largest gas developments, is advanced and its expansion is set to be cleared by the Australian government shortly.That will pave the way for Chevron, 50 per cent owner and operator of Gorgon, to deliver its ”final investment decision” before the end of the year.A floating LNG project has not been tested commercially, although Royal Dutch Shell is also developing a similar scheme off the Australian coast. The projects plan to use a ship-borne plant to freeze the gas to liquid before it is exported.A final investment decision on the GDF/Santos project is still years away. The French group will make an upfront payment of US$200m and an additional US$170m once the final investment decision hurdle is cleared. It will also shoulder development costs until that decision is reached.As well as taking cash off the table, the deal frees up Santos to focus on its more immediate LNG projects. It hopes to make first shipments from its Papua New Guinea project, which is being led by ExxonMobil, in 2013, and from its Gladstone project in Queensland, which aims to convert coal seam methane gas reserves into LNG, in 2014. Santos has partnered with Malaysia’s Petronas in its Gladstone venture.Other parties that are thought to have shown interest in Santos’s Bonaparte fields include Total, Eni, Conoco-Phillips and Australia’s Woodside Petroleum.GDF’s technical expertise in floating LNG technology is one of the reasons it was selected by Santos. The deal also marks GDF’s first investment in the Australian LNG sector.Gérard Mestrallet, GDF chairman and chief executive, said the partnership with Santos in the Bonaparte Basin development was a “key priority for GDF Suez globally”.“By extending our reach to the Asian market, it allows us to offer a truly global LNG marketing platform to our customers,” he said.GDF/Santos propose a 2m tonne per annum project.Citigroup advised Santos on the transaction.
428;COP;Conocophillips;2009-08-14T16:51:17Z;Oil industry split on climate law protests;;A rift has broken out within the US oil industry over a controversial plan to deploy thousands of workers in so-called “energy citizen” rallies protesting against imminent climate legislation.The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the US oil industry, has written to member companies asking them to “move aggressively” to stage up to 22 gatherings.It has strong support from key members such as Exxon, which has warned that the legislation could put businesses employing millions of workers “at a disadvantage” with global competitors.But the plan threatens to expose splits in the API as some members belong to another group, the US Climate Action Partnership, which supports many of Barack Obama’s environmental policies.Shell, which has been a key member of the UCAP, has argued that tackling climate change is “the pro-growth strategy.” Other companies which belong to UCAP include General Electric, Siemens, BP America and ConocoPhillips.Yet all these companies simultaneously provide funding to the API.“The truth is that the API is all over the place on this issue, there is nowhere near a unanimous view,” said one oil industry source. Some members saw imminent environmental laws as “the work of the devil” while others took a more progressive view, he said.The secret memo was passed to environmental group Greenpeace despite the entreaties of author Jack Gerard, president of the API, to “treat this information as sensitive …we don’t want critics to know our game plan.”According to one source, the letter came from an API member who was “unhappy with the concept”.Greenpeace criticised the stunt as a cynical “astroturf” campaign, arguing it would predominantly feature energy workers rather than “grassroots” citizens.But the API said workers would not be hired to attend or bussed in: “I don’t know whether they’re required to go there,” said spokesman Bill Bush. ”I doubt that seriously.”The action, which has support from 60 other industry groups – ranging from the American Trucking Associations to the National Association of Manufacturers – may invoke comparisons with recent protests against the Obama administration over healthcare.The rallies are designed to protest against “unsound energy policy” such as tax increases on the industry and the Waxman-Markey bill, which will create a carbon trading scheme and force energy groups to produce some renewables. The API has told members it will provide the logistics for the rallies.The memo says that a turnout of several hundred employees at each rally will be crucial: “In the 11 states with an industry core, our member company local leadership is essential to achieving the participation level that Senators cannot ignore.”Mr Bush said he believed the memo was genuine. Asked whether the employees of API member companies attending the rally would identify themselves as part of an industry effort, he said: ”I don’t think anyone’s going to be carrying signs saying they’re from this organisation and that organisation.”Greenpeace has written to the API to ask why it is fighting climate change regulation when several of its members have expressed public concerns about the issue.Asked whether he was aware of dissent within the group, Mr Bush said: “I don’t that I can answer very well – we have 400 members or thereabouts, and we have an awful lot of issues that we talk about and work on. And every single thing we’ve done does not include every single member.”Meanwhile Greenpeace also criticised the API’s repeated claim that Waxman-Markey will drive gasoline prices to $4.The research on which this claim is based – by the Heritage Foundation – says this will not happen until 2035, a quarter of a century from now.The API is planning rallies in cities including Houston, Detroit, Anchorage, Philadelphia and Nashville as well as many smaller conurbations. Greenpeace claimed that many of these featured congressmen in vulnerable seats.Additional reporting: Sheila McNulty
429;COP;Conocophillips;2009-07-30T19:34:03Z;Sagging oil refineries;;"With oil prices being streamed live on bubblevision, it is easy to obsess on the hyperkinetic futures market and forget that the large, integrated companies dominating the industry also make plenty of money from refining and marketing the stuff. “ Crude” is much more than just benchmark WTI or Brent, and the gyrations of different varieties, along with a glut of refined products, have rained on the supermajors’ parade.ExxonMobil’s unpleasant earnings surprise on Thursday, for example, came from a two-thirds drop in refining earnings. The story was much the same at BP, Shell and especially ConocoPhillips, all of which suffered from a convergence in prices of low-quality heavy crude with lighter grades.Chevron signalled its results will be similarly hit, while pure refiners Valero and Tesoro both swung to losses in the last quarter. With Latin American and Middle Eastern producers paring heavy crude output, expensive refineries suited to handle it are sputtering. And, with demand falling amid plenty of new capacity in Asia, poor utilisation is sapping earnings.The problem may be secular, rather than cyclical, for refiners in the developed world. The coming years will be particularly tough for US refineries as a result of ebbing demand, competition from biofuels and new emissions rules. Consulting firm Deloitte compares the coming years to the collapse in US refinery profits in the early 1980s, which led to many closures. There were 319 US refineries in 1980 and 149 by 2006.Meanwhile, utilisation, which peaked at 90 per cent in 1977, fell below 70 per cent by 1981. More recently, utilisation peaked at 93 per cent in 2004 and Deloitte forecasts it will drop to 77 per cent by 2020.Refining, recently promoted to being a high-flying profit-centre, is back to being a drag.

430;COP;Conocophillips;2009-07-30T12:56:57Z;ExxonMobil quarterly profits fall 66%;;ExxonMobil, the largest US oil company, said on Thursday that its second quarter profits fell by 66 per cent as the global downturn sapped demand for fuel and dragged down energy prices.Net income at Exxon was $3.95bn, or 82 cents a share, compared with $11.7bn, or $2.24, in the same period a year ago. The results disappointed Wall Street analysts’ expectations of $1.02.”Global economic conditions continue to impact the energy industry both in the volatility of commodity prices and reduced demand for products,” Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chairman, said in a statement.The second quarter results were hit by a one-time $140m interest charge related to the Valdez oil spill. Exxon’s revenues were down by 46 per cent to $74.46bn.The Texas-based company has been working to cope with the more volatile oil markets by slowing production. It said that it in the second quarter production was down by 2.5 per cent compared with the second quarter of 2008.Exxon cut capital expenditure and spending on exploration by 6 per cent, to $6.6bn during the second three months of the year.Thursday’s results come after ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, reported a 76 per cent drop in profits earlier in the week but saw a strong rise in production for the second quarter. That fall in profits was steeper than the 66 per cent underlying decline reported by BP, the first of the leading international oil companies to report this season, but in line with analysts’ expectations.Oil markets have shown extra volatility in the last year. On Thursday prices rebounded after tumbling by more than $3 a barrel in the previous session, leading a recovery across commodity markets. In energy markets, Nymex September West Texas Intermediate rose 65 cents to $64.00 a barrel, after sinking to a low of $63.04 in the previous session following a huge increase in US crude stocks which fuelled concerns about weak demand in America.Exxon said on Wednesday that it would maintain its dividend of 42 cents a share in the third quarter this year. Shares of Exxon fell by 1.88 per cent to $70.09 in pre-market trading on Thursday.
431;COP;Conocophillips;2009-07-29T19:34:23Z;Conoco pins hope on exploration portfolio;;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, has reported a 76 per cent drop in profits but a strong rise in production for the second quarter.Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chairman and chief executive, also claimed success in his drive to cut costs.The fall in profits was steeper than the 66 per cent underlying decline reported by BP, the first of the leading international oil companies to report this season, but in line with analysts’ expectations.Conoco has been seen as the weakest as well as the smallest of the “big three” US oil companies. Over the past year its shares have fallen by 48 per cent, compared to a 12 per cent decline for ExxonMobil, the largest, and a 19 per cent fall for Chevron.At the start of the year, falling commodity prices forced Conoco to take a $34bn writedown on the reduction in its asset values, announce 1,300 job cuts, and scale back capital expenditures to $12.5bn this year from $15.3bn in 2008.In the second quarter, post-tax earnings were $1.3bn, down from $5.44bn in the equivalent period of 2008, as plunging oil and gas prices and weak refining margins slashed revenues. Conoco has made natural gas its focus for several years, with a variety of deals including the Burlington Resources acquisition in 2006, and gas accounted for almost half of its production of 1.872m barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter.While the price of oil has picked up strongly this year, doubling from its low point in February, the price of gas has continued to decline.Conoco also suffered from the squeeze on refinery margins. Its refining and marketing business made a loss of $52m in the second quarter, compared to a $664m profit in the equivalent period of 2008.Like most other large oil companies, Conoco is not able to cover its capital spending and dividend payments from its cash flow from operations, and its debts are rising. Net debt was $30.4bn at the end of June, 34 per cent of capital employed, up from $27.5bn at the end of 2008.In a recent research report, analysts at Credit Suisse highlighted Conoco’s poor long-term profitability.“We continue to be concerned by the company’s persistently low return on capital,” the analysts said. Conoco’s return on capital was 5 per cent in the first quarter, compared to a 10-year industry average of 17 per cent.However, analysts also pointed to some of Conoco’s strengths. The company has created some excitement with its recent announcement of a successful “wildcat” exploration well in the Browse basin off the coast of Australia.In another recent report Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank said Conoco’s plan to drill the next prospect on the project gave credibility to its claim to be rebuilding its portfolio “with the drill bit”. He described Larry Archibald, Conoco’s new head of exploration, as “highly regarded”.One bright spot in Wednesday’s results was that production was 7 per cent higher in the second quarter than in the equivalent period of 2008, with new production coming on in countries from the UK to Vietnam.Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy, said that for the long term Conoco had some positions that could be highly successful.The company’s 20 per cent stake in Lukoil, one of Russia’s biggest oil companies in Russia, while subject to whatever political winds are blowing through that country, could yet prove valuable.Conoco’s heavy emphasis on developed countries could also be a strength, given the growing vulnerability of western oil companies to resource nationalism in less-developed economies.He added that the natural gas business would improve once the economy picked up, as the US looked to replace carbon-intensive coal with a less polluting fuel.
432;COP;Conocophillips;2009-07-17T00:45:51Z;Ecuador seizes Perenco oil fields;;Ecuador has seized control of oil fields operated by France’s Perenco as part of a long-running tax dispute that threatens production of 21,000 barrels a day.The country, under leftist president Rafael Correa, had already begun to expropriate oil from the Perenco concessions four months ago, saying it owed $327m in back taxes.Thursday’s seizure came after Perenco said it would halt production at the concessions. PetroEcuador, the state oil company, said in a statement it was continuing operations.The tax dispute dates back to October 2007, when Ecuador increased the windfall tax on oil from 50 per cent to 99 per cent. Although it later reset the tax at 70 per cent, Perenco disputes its tax bill and has taken the issue to a World Bank arbitrator, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. In May the centre said Ecuador should stop expropriating oil from the Perenco concessions and hold the disputed funds in escrow.Burlington Resources, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, is a minority partner in the concessions.
433;COP;Conocophillips;2009-07-13T21:49:17Z;Financial stocks lead Wall Street rally;;Financial stocks led US equity markets to their strongest rally in six weeks on Monday, taking the benchmark S&P 500 index back above the psychologically important 900 level.Banks were stronger throughout a volatile session after Meredith Whitney, the analyst who turned bearish on the banking sector before many of her peers, recommended buying shares in Goldman Sachs.Ms Whitney said Goldman was likely to report bumper earnings on Tuesday on the back of strong revenues from underwriting new debt and equity issuances. The bank’s shares climbed 5.3 per cent to $149.44.She said the sector as a whole could rise 15 per cent in the short term after the recent glut of new issuance. Morgan Stanley picked up 7.6 per cent to $27.91, while JPMorgan gained 7.3 per cent to $34.71.Bank of America, which Ms Whitney said had the cheapest shares compared with assets among its peers, excluding Citigroup, gained 9.3 per cent to $12.99.CIT Group was a blot on the financial sector, however, as the shares in the commercial lender, which is struggling to find financing, tumbled on fears it may go bankrupt.The shares shed 11.8 per cent to $1.35 after the Wall Street Journal reported the company had hired a lawyer to explore a possible bankruptcy filing, and Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said he was monitoring developments at the company.But the overall bullishness in the financial sector helped lift shares in General Electric, which has a substantial financial arm. Its stock jumped 6.3 per cent to $11.46.“The markets have fallen for four weeks and investors were probably looking for a reason to send them higher. People saying that financials have had a better quarter is as good a reason as any to do so,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management.The S&P closed 2.5 per cent higher at 901.05. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.3 per cent to 8,331.68 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index advanced 2.1 per cent to 1,793.21.The markets opened the session higher before quickly dropping and then rebounding after the S&P hit a resistance level just above 875, where it was shortly before the results of the government’s stress tests on bank balance sheets this year.But volumes remained modest, with many investors choosing to wait to buy or sell stocks until after earnings are reported.“Volumes will be thin, but pick up throughout the week,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab.“Those who got in early could see the biggest benefits, but are also taking the biggest risk. The rest of the market is waiting to see what companies say about the future when they report their earnings.”Energy companies recovered early losses as the price of oil rebounded following a bruising morning as it continued to dip further below $60. Chevron was 1.7 per cent up at $62.44 while ConocoPhilips ended 2.3 per cent higher at $40.62.Microsoft was pulled in opposite directions by separate pieces of news.Investors were disappointed by a survey carried out by ScriptLogic, which suggested six in 10 companies would not buy the latest version of the Windows operating systemBut there was optimism on news that the company would bring out free online versions of its software this week as it steps up its latest battle with Google.Investors were also reassured by in the Wall Street Journal that the company is pitching Razorfish, its digital advertising agency, to five global advertising companies. The shares finished 3.8 per cent up at $23.23.Meanwhile, Best Buy, the electronics retailer, was upgraded by the broker Oppenheimer, which said the markets had oversold the shares and not taken into account how much the company would benefit from the recent demise of its rival Circuit City.Best Buy’s shares rose 4.1 per cent to $34.12.Shares in Fastenal, the construction equipment retailer, retreated 0.6 per cent to $31.53 after the company reported disappointing earnings, with sales in its industrial production business remaining low.
434;COP;Conocophillips;2009-07-10T20:22:59Z;Earnings fears weigh on Wall Street;;US stocks looked closed the week at levels not seen since the beginning of May as a month of losses took its toll.Energy companies have dominated trade throughout the week as the price of oil crashed through the $60 mark, down 10 per cent since last week and more than 16 per cent from its recent highs.This proved a drag on energy stocks, which once again led the selling on Friday after Chevron said its second-quarter earnings might fall short of estimates. The company said a weak dollar counteracted the effect of the oil price rise during the quarter, and its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $61.40. Other energy producers were also hit. Exxon-Mobil dropped 1.3 per cent to $65.12 and ConocoPhillips lost 1.5 per cent to $39.72.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished the session down 0.4 per cent at 879.13, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 8,146.52. But the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.2 per cent on strength in technology stocks to 1,756.03.That left all three down between 1.6 and 2.3 per cent for the week, the fourth straight decline.Investors continued to worry about the state of the US consumer, with low domestic demand contributing to falling retail sales numbers on Wednesday and a narrower-than-expected trade gap on Friday. A lower consumer confidence number suggested that the trend was likely to continue at least for the near term.The lack of demand for US goods also spurred talk of a possible second stimulus plan during the week, as politicians and political advisers gave conflicting messages over whether one was likely to be passed.Investors were split between those who saw such talk as a bearish sign on the economy and those who believed its eventual implementation would provide a boost for equities.But even as earnings season kicked off with a better-than-expected number from Alcoa, caution reigned and the markets continued to slide. “It’s almost a case of earnings versus the economy,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.Banks enjoyed a positive session on Thursday, but lost ground on Friday morning as reports said several Wall Street firms are complaining the government is demanding too high a price for the warrants they hold as part of the financial bail-out earlier this year.The Wall Street Journal said JPMorgan has waived its right to buy back the warrants and will let them be sold on the open market instead.JPMorgan’s shares lost 3.8 per cent to $32.34, while Citigroup fell 3.7 per cent to $2.59 and Bank of America declined 0.8 per cent to $11.88. Elsewhere in the financial sector, shares in Progressive, the car insurer, fell 0.8 per cent to $14.32 as it reported a smaller quarterly profit than expected, even though revenues rose on stronger policy sales and better performing investments.Meanwhile CIT Group, the commercial lender, plunged 17.7 per cent to $1.53 after Bloomberg reported the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is unwilling to guarantee its debt.In the technology sector, Yahoo gained 2.6 per cent to $14.93 after an analyst at broker Thomas Weisel upgraded the search engine company’s shares on growing confidence in its new management structure.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs downgraded shares in IBM, saying the stock’s recent outperformance of the rest of the sector would not continue in spite of an upturn in demand. IBM lost 1.2 per cent to $100.83.
435;COP;Conocophillips;2009-07-06T21:14:07Z;Wall St defensive stocks provide support;;Defensive stocks spurred a late rally on Wall Street to turn US equities positive on Monday following the previous session’s heavy falls.Multinational brand names fared well as investors remained in a cautious mode ahead of the start of earnings season this week.Philip Morris gained 2.8 per cent to $44.15 and Colgate-Palmolive picked up 3.2 per cent to $74.38.But energy and materials stocks were a significant drag as investors continued to worry about the pace of economic recovery.Those concerns triggered a fall on Thursday ahead of the long independence day weekend after a worse than expected jobs report, and were further heightened by words from Joe Biden, the US vice-president, over the weekend.Mr Biden said the Obama administration had “misread” how bad the economy was when forecasting 8 per cent unemployment, which took a further toll on commodities stocks as investors worried about demand.The price of oil tumbled to a five-week low, weighing on ConocoPhillips, which lost 0.3 per cent to $40.83, and Schlumberger, which fell 2.1 per cent to $51.45.Metal producers also suffered and, with Deutsche Bank warning that demand for copper could fall 3.9 per cent in 2009, shares in Freeport McMoRan, which mines the metal, gave up 7.6 per cent to $45.94.Alcoa the aluminium maker that is due to start the earnings season on Wednesday, dropped 6.1 per cent to $9.26.“We could see a defensive rotation here as investors wait cautiously for the start of earnings season,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished 0.3 per cent higher at 898.72 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 8,324.87. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.5 per cent to 1,787.40.Many big name banks were also lower with Citigroup down 3.1 per cent at $2.79 and Bank of America3.9 per cent lower at $12.15.The financial sector was near its lowest level since the results of the government’s stress tests on bank balance sheets sparked a rally in May.American Express was one of the few financial stocks to find significant gains after Stifel Nicolaus, the brokerage group, said it may benefit from new legislation restricting teaser rates, which analysts said AmEx did not rely on.AmEx’s shares picked up 5.6 per cent to $23.52.The economic negativity was punctuated by promising signs from Ford and FedEx two companies that provide early signs on consumer and corporate health.Ford’s shares lost early gains after sales at the company’s joint ventures in China rose 14 per cent to record highs. They closed 2.4 per cent lower at $5.75.Meanwhile, Michael Ducker, head of FedEx’s international business, told a German magazine that he saw signs of a turnround in the second half of the year. Shares in FedEx were up 3.2 per cent to $56.04.Data from the Institute of Supply Management also provided a glimmer of economic hope, showing that business activity in the non-manufacturing sector was marginally better than expected in June.But analysts warned economic data would need to show more positive signs to trigger another rally.“For the market to continue to rally, the news will have to go from negative to neutral or positive, and investors have started to realise that,” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers.EMC provided some impetus to the technology sector after the company said it would increase its offer for data storage company Data Domain to $33.50 a share.This puts EMC in a head-to-head battle with NetApp, Data Domain’s rival, which received regulatory clearance for its own bid for the company.EMC picked up 0.9 per cent to $12.89 while NetApp was 0.6 per cent lower at $18.85. Data Domain rose 2.6 per cent to $34.06.In the telecommunications sector, Sprint Nextel rose as analysts at Auriga upgraded the stock, citing continued demand for the company’s Boost pre-paid mobile telephone contracts, which have sold well during the recession.Its shares gained 3.5 per cent to $4.47.
436;COP;Conocophillips;2009-07-02T20:44:48Z;Wall Street slides on jobs report;;"US stocks took a pounding on Thursday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index turning negative for the year as investors reacted to data showing many more people lost their jobs in June than expected.Analysts had far underestimated the number of new non-farm employees who would lose their jobs during the month, and even though the unemployment rate and the number of people claiming jobless benefits on a weekly basis were both better than expected, the market sold off heavily.Consumer stocks were directly hit by concerns over joblessness, and retailers felt some of the worst effects. Macy’s gave up 6.3 per cent to $11, while Best Buy dropped 5.3 per cent to $32.08 and Nordstrom, the clothing retailer, declined 7.1 per cent to $18.63.“The jobless figures were abysmal,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.“We’re now in a malevolent cycle and the risk is that the government will have to issue even more debt. This could lead to higher interest rates, which would undermine the whole V-shaped recovery.”But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, disagreed. “The market is over-reacting,” he said. “The combined loss of jobs for the last two months is only just more than that seen in January. These are the beginning stages of the stabilisation of the unemployment rate.”The S&P 500 closed 2.9 per cent down at 896.42 while the Dow Jones was 2.6 per cent per cent lower at 8,280.74. This was after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was extended for 15 minutes after a technical glitch.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7 per cent to 1,796.52.That left the markets between 1.8 and 2.5 per cent lower for the week, which was cut short because of the Independence Day
holiday.Thursday’s selling knocked the markets out of the narrow trading range they had been in all week, which saw the close of the best quarter for the S&P since December 1998.Equities rose and fell with the price of commodities throughout the week, with oil climbing above $72 a barrel only to fall back below $68.But in a week which saw the release of several important pieces of economic data, trading volumes remained thin, with much of Wall Street taking an early break ahead of the long weekend.There was further volatility in commodities on Thursday, and energy producers fell as the price of oil continued the previous sessions’ declines.Schlumberger gave up 3.2 per cent to $52.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $40.96.Elsewhere in the sector, NRG gave up its pre-market gains, which had been made on an increased bid from Exelon after a fall in Exelon’s share price meant there would be less of a premium attached for NRG shareholders.The bid is now $7.45bn, but NRG’s shares fell with the price of oil, dropping 4.8 per cent to $24.80. Exelon lost 4.3 per cent to $49.37.Materials companies also suffered and Freeport McMoRan the copper and gold miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $49.72. Newmont Mining dropped 4.6 per cent to $40.26.Airlines fluctuated as Morgan Stanley reviewed its ratings on some of the biggest US carriers. The bank started coverage on Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest, recommending a price target of $9 after recent selling pressure.The shares climbed 0.5 per cent to $5.88.Morgan Stanley also upgraded shares in Continental Airlines, saying it was a likely survivor from the fall-out in the industry.There was some pressure on the stock from news on Wednesday evening that its revenue per seat may have fallen more than 20 per cent in June compared with a year earlier. But the shares still managed to gain 6.2 per cent to $9.79.Southwest Airlines fell 4.4 per cent to $6.50, however, after the bank downgraded its shares, saying higher oil prices would take a toll on profit margins.Meanwhile Illumina, which makes equipment to analyse DNA, dropped after reporting lower revenues than expected as cash-strapped researchers delayed orders. The shares lost 12.3 per cent to $33.46."
437;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oil groups resist Iraq’s tough bid terms;;Iraq’s first big effort to attract foreign investment to its oil sector met stiff resistance from companies on Tuesday.Only BP of the UK and China’s CNPC were willing to agree to Baghdad’s tough terms, allowing them to win a bid to turn the country’s Rumaila field into the world’s second largest.In a process billed as crucial to Iraq’s economic future, seven other oil and gas fields, including the highly sought after West Qurna field, failed to attract bids favourable enough to meet Iraq’s conditions.“The maximum service fee the Iraqis were willing to pay blew a lot of bids out of the water,” said Alex Munton, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the industry consultants.The auction underlines the difficulties faced by Baghdad as it seeks to rebuild the state. Pressure is likely to increase on Hussein Shahristani, the oil minister, who is already under fire for failing to show progress in the dilapidated oil industry since the 2003 toppling of Saddam Hussein.In the countdown to the US-led invasion of Iraq, Bush administration officials predicted Iraq would be able to meet its own postwar reconstruction needs within months. Paul Wolfowitz, deputy defence secretary, told a congressional panel in 2003 that oil revenues could bring between $50bn and $100bn within two or three years – a prediction that proved unrealistic.Although companies were willing to venture into Iraq without new oil industry legislation, they balked on Tuesday at the fees the government was demanding.BP was forced to halve its fee – to $2 a barrel from $3.99 – to secure the contract. It also promised to boost the field’s production, which is about 1m barrels day, to 2.85m b/d within six years, second only to Saudi Arabia’s huge Ghawar field.It is an ambitious target and one that will not yield a high profit margin, said Mr Munton. But he said that it would give the company a bigger stake in the Middle East, where its presence is lighter than its competitors.For CNPC, BP’s partner, developing Rumaila will offer the chance to secure oil supplies for China and develop ties with a key petrostate.The rest of the auction was largely disappointing. Royal Dutch Shell initially bid for the Kirkuk field but rejected Iraq’s demand for better terms. Companies including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, from the US, Europeans Eni and Edison, and Cnooc, Sinopec and CNPC, of China, did the same at other fields. Maysan, the gas field, failed to garner any bids at all.Mr Shahristani, the architect of the bidding round, gave companies extra time to revise their bids but all, other than BP and CNPC, walked away.The main problem had been the terms but companies were also concerned about the lack of a hydrocarbons law and the unanswered question of who had the final say on decisions during the fields’ reconstruction – the foreign oil company or Iraqi’s national oil company with which it would work.Nadia Salem, Iraq team leader at Al Tamimi, a law firm, advised some of the bidding companies. She said: “From the contracts it is difficult to see who will have the final say. It looks like the Iraqis will run things on the ground at least in the first two years and the companies had to accept that.”The bidding round took place on the day US troops handed over control of Iraqi cities to the country’s own security forces, highlighting, for some, security concerns about working in the country. But companies were willing to take risks for the chance to work at the biggest oil frontier to be opened up since the fall of the Soviet Union.Iraq, which produces about 2.4m b/d, holds reserves of about 115bn barrels. Those reserves are relatively easy and inexpensive to tap.Only Saudi Arabia and Iran hold more oil but both are off limits to international companies, which are pushed into increasingly remote areas. Thus BP and CNPC’s gamble may yet pay off, especially if Iraq opens up more of its ­undeveloped fields to bidding as Nouri Al-Maliki, the prime minister, hinted on Tuesday.For Iraqis who want to see their oil production provide revenue for rebuilding the country, the auction’s outcome will come as a disappointment.
438;COP;Conocophillips;2009-06-23T20:37:27Z;Wall Street struggles for direction;;"US stocks struggled for momentum on Tuesday having crashed through several significant support levels during the previous session.An encouraging auction of government debt helped lift stocks during the afternoon. But the markets remained subdued after disappointing news from Boeing suppressed early gains, which came on higher commodities prices and economic optimism.The aircraft manufacturer announced a further delay to its 787 Dreamliner, which is already two years behind schedule, as the company looks to reinforce part of the bodywork. The news sent the shares tumbling 6.5 per cent to $43.87.There was a knock-on effect on other parts of the market, particularly on
Boeing’s suppliers.Honeywell lost 0.5 per cent to $31.43, Rockwell Collins slid 1.2 per cent to $41.91 and Goodrich fell 0.7 per cent to $49.07.Banking stocks also lost ground after initial rises as fresh economic data did not prove as positive as some had hoped.Sales of existing homes rose less than expected in May but most banks managed to hold on to some of their early gains as house prices remained relatively stable and manufacturing rose in the Richmond,
Virginia, area.Bank of America closed up 2.4 per cent at $12.23 and JPMorgan finished 2.1 per cent higher at $33.57.Commodities stocks also made a partial recovery as materials prices rose following a bruising previous session. The price of oil picked up, and was followed by energy companies. Schlumberger rose 1.9 per cent to $53.30 while ConocoPhillips climbed 2 per cent to $41.25.Metal producers were also higher following Monday’s losses. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, climbed 4.4 per cent to $47.18 while AK Steel gained 7.2 per cent to $17.68.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 895.10 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 8,322.91 and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.1 per cent to 1,764.92.“I don’t think this is the start of a major pull-back,” said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services.“Buyers and sellers have come together and begun to agree on a fair price following the powerful rally, which is why we have seen sideways trade.”But Tim Howkins, chief executive of IG Group, said: “Equities need to go down again. They bounced too quickly and the feeling is we still need to see a
complete capitulation.”The mood on Wall Street was lifted by encouraging words from Moody’s, the rating agency, which said the triple A rating on US debt “remains solid”, easing fears about how costly it could become for the government to borrow and fund its stimulus plans.The optimism surrounding the government’s spending power was later boosted by the afternoon’s auction of Treasury debt.Kroger, the supermarket operator, reported better than expected profits before the market opened but the results failed to provide a fillip for the stock as revenues came in lower than analysts had predicted. The shares slipped 0.1 per cent to $21.76.There was better news for fellow retailer Office Depot, as it received a $350m cash infusion from BC Partners in return for a 20 per cent stake. The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to $3.89.Several pieces of news from the mobile-phone sector buoyed communications and technology companies.Intel rose after Bloom-berg reported that the company had won a contract to supply microchips to Nokia for use in its mobile-phone handsets.The deal would be a breakthrough in Intel’s efforts to secure a foothold in the mobile telephone market, and the shares gained 0.8 per cent to $15.81.Meanwhile, Motorola picked up 4 per cent to $6.27 after Bank of America recommended buying the shares, saying that Motorola was having some success with new handset sales to carriers.Metro PCS, the mobile service operator, climbed on news that it would replace Tyco Electronics in the S&P 500 from June 29. This would mean the company’s shares may be bought by investors trying to track the benchmark index. The stock advanced 5.2 per cent to $14.33. Tyco fell 2.6 per cent to $18.59."
439;COP;Conocophillips;2009-06-22T20:35:55Z;US stocks slide on fears for recovery;;"US stocks fell sharply on Monday, sending the S&P 500 through several important psychological barriers as investors worried about the pace of economic recovery.The benchmark index fell below 900 for the first time this month, taking it below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages and into negative territory for the year.Commodities prices fell as the dollar strengthened. Fears over global demand knocked oil prices, which continued to fall from their highs.Shares in energy companies followed oil lower, with ConocoPhillipsfalling 5.9 per cent to $40.43 and Schlumberger giving up 5.5 per cent to $52.32.Copper prices also suffered after estimated Chinese copper consumption dropped 3.5 per cent for May compared to April, leading to concerns that the country might soon stop restocking the metal.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 11.3 per cent to $45.18. Prices of other metals also fell, bringing down shares in the companies that produce them. AK Steel gave up 13 per cent to $16.50 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, fell
8.9 per cent to $10.02.The general economic worries were exacerbated by a report from the World Bank that warned the global recession would be deeper than it had predicted in March, with the world economy suffering a 2.9 per cent decline in 2009.“The figure is surprisingly downbeat given the fact that it is even lower than what the International Monetary Fund is expecting,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.Karl Mills, president of Jurika, Mills & Keifer, agreed, saying: “The economy is still sicker than people realise.”The S&P closed down 3.1 per cent at 893.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4 per cent to 8,339.01 points and the Nasdaq Composite index declined 3.4 per cent to 1,766.19 points.Investors bet that volatility would return to the markets after several weeks of trading within a narrow range.The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge spiked 11.4 per cent to 31.19.US investors were also nervous about the pace of the domestic recovery after Walgreen, the fast growing chain of chemists and general retailers, reported lower profits than Wall Street expected, despite rising sales. The shares fell 5.7 per cent to $29.64.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said that recent signs on corporate earnings were not promising. “The profit outlook is becoming less certain given the recent trend in earnings reports and a more mixed economic outlook,” he wrote.Delta Air Lines dropped 6.9 per cent to $5.65 after Richard Anderson, the chief executive, said the company has absorbed a $250m hit to second-quarter revenue as a result of swine flu, and had been forced to cut capacity as a result.Shares in Apple fluctuated as optimism over sales of the new model of its iPhone competed with concerns over the health of Steve Jobs, its talismanic chief executive.The stock slipped in pre-market trade after reports at the weekend that Mr Jobs had undergone a liver transplant two months ago.But the shares rose after the company said it had sold more than 1m units of the new iPhone, compared to forecasts of closer to 500,000.The stock opened higher, but then dropped as the market extended its losses. It closed 1.5 per cent lower at $137.37.Bank of America lost 9.7 per cent to $11.94 after two more board members joined the list of departures from the company, bringing the total to seven since April.Its rival Citigroup dropped 5.4 per cent to $3, with analysts at Fox-Pitt saying that the bank’s planned conversion of preferred shares into common equity would put “significant pressure” on the stock.Credit card company Discover Financial Services avoided the worst of the selling in the financial sector following its announcement of a surprise quarterly profit last week.The figures caused analysts at RBC Capital Markets to raise their price target on the company on Monday, and the shares fell a modest 0.1 per cent to $9.31."
440;COP;Conocophillips;2009-06-18T23:29:20Z;Refinery row escalates as 900 sacked;;Almost 900 workers have been sacked at Total’s Lindsey oil refinery in Lincolnshire, the Unite union said on Thursday night.The union told the Press Association it was “extremely concerned’’ about Total’s actions at the refinery and it is understood to be working behind the scenes to facilitate talks with the company’s local management.More than 2,000 construction workers had staged wildcat strikes on Thursday as a dispute over jobs escalated into sympathy stoppages at about 10 petrochemical sites and power stations around the country.The dispute began a week ago at the refinery. Up to 1,200 contract workers went on unofficial strike in protest at a subcontractor proposing to axe 51 jobs while another employer on the site was hiring staff.The action spread on Thursday to sites including ConocoPhillips’s Humber refinery near Lindsey, BP’s Saltend refinery near Hull, the South Hook gas terminal in west Wales and power stations at Fiddlers Ferry in Cheshire, Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, Aberthaw in south Wales and Didcot in Oxfordshire.Stoppages were also reported at Drax and Eggborough power stations in Yorkshire, West Burton in Nottinghamshire and a BOC oxygen plant at Scunthorpe.The Lindsey dispute has been deadlocked since planned talks between unions and employers failed to take place on Tuesday. Total said the strike was illegal and talks could not begin until workers returned to their jobs.The company said it was “extremely disappointed and frustrated” that the contractor workforce on its £200m hydro-desulphurisation project had decided to continue an unofficial walkout.It added: “The continued protests are illegal and the contractor workforce has chosen to ignore the repeated requests by Jacobs (one of the contractors) and Total for them to return to work as required by the agreed industry process.“The HDS-3 construction project remains closed. However, the refinery continues to operate normally and is not affected by this action.”Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, said he had been in touch with the conciliation service Acas and was seeking talks with Nigel Tranter, Lindsey’s general manager, to try to end the deadlock.This is the third big flare-up at engineering construction sites this year and comes as workers are to be balloted on official national industrial action over jobs, pay and conditions later this summer.Lindsey was at the centre of a dispute over use of Italian and Portuguese labour in February. This prompted walkouts at refineries, gas terminals and power stations. Lindsey workers were also involved in recent strikes over the hiring of 40 Polish laggers at the South Hook terminal.
441;COP;Conocophillips;2009-06-18T08:09:54Z;Santos signs LNG deal with Petronas;;Santos, the Australian energy group, has strengthened its links with Petronas after signing a foundation supply agreement with the Malaysian oil and gas group for its proposed Gladstone liquefied natural gas project.Petronas has agreed to buy 2m tonnes of LNG from the project for 20 years from 2014, with the option of a further 1m tonnes.The customer agreement is a milestone for GLNG, a 60/40 joint venture between Santos and Petronas. It comes only weeks after the UK’s BG Group also signed its first supply agreement for Australian LNG with CNOOC of China.Santos/Petronas, BG and at least two other large consortiums are vying to develop reserves of coal bed methane – liquefied natural gas produced from coal deposits – in the Australian state of Queensland.Other consortiums include a venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Australia’s Arrow Energy, and a combination of Australia’s Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips of the US.All are attempting to develop the reserves to feed energy hungry markets in Asia. Securing customers is critical for the consortiums as they invest billions of dollars developing their projects.Analysts expect the consortiums to consolidate into two groupings and believe Santos/Petronas and BG are well positioned. Origin/Conoco is yet to secure a foundation customer, while the Shell/Arrow team have the smallest reserves of the big four.David Knox, Santos chief executive, said GLNG was in discussions with other parties. “It’s a firm 2m tonne deal we’ve done with Petronas last night, and we have the option to sell another 1m tonnes by Christmas time, and then we’ve probably got another half million tonnes available to other customers.”We’ve got a period now of six months of hard marketing to sell the remainder of the volumes,” he said.Santos did not disclose the value of the supply agreement but Mr Knox said it was “in line with recent industry practice for long term contracts”.The Australian group hopes to reach a ”final investment decision” on GLNG in the first six months of 2010, ahead of its rivals, with maiden gas shipments in 2014.Santos has 12 customised rigs operating and plans to build a 435km pipeline, capable of supporting three trains – LNG production lines – at its Curtis Island processing plant at Gladstone.CNOOC has agreed to buy 3.6m tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years from BG and is taking small stakes in the UK group’s LNG plant and some of its gas fields.The supply represents about 5.3bn cubic metres of gas a year, roughly 8 per cent of Chinese demand.
442;COP;Conocophillips;2009-06-17T03:10:17Z;Economic data strengthen mood on Wall St;;US stocks made a modest rebound on Tuesday morning following the previous session’s sell-off.Commodities stocks remained volatile as the price of oil and metals snapped their two-day losing streak to head towards the highs set during last week. Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the last few sessions, picked up ground once more. AK Steel rose 6.3 per cent to $19.47 while US Steel, which is re-hiring workers in Illinois and Ontario to cope with higher demand, advanced 3.9 per cent to $38.54.Oil also rose, peaking back above the $72 mark after climbing $1.48 to $72.10 per barerel of US crude. That lifted energy producers, including ConocoPhillips, which was 1.9 per cent up at $43.90 and Schlumberger, which rose 1.3 per cent to $59.32.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April. But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.Economists said inflation remained a distant threat. “The continued moderation in the growth of broad money suggests there is little reason to fear that the Fed’s quantitative easing will lead to sharply higher inflation and interest rates,” wrote Capital Economics.Equities were also boosted by figures showing that builders started work on 532,000 homes in May compared with expectations of just 508,000. This lifted homebuilders before the bell after they were some of the previous session’s heaviest fallers, following an unexpected dip in confidence in the sector. Lennar picked up 6.6 per cent to $8.12 and DR Horton gained 3.1 per cent to $9.68.The positive economic data saw futures extend their early gains, but they fell again shortly before the open after industrial production in May was shown to have fallen more than expected. The markets then opened just about in positive territory.After half an hour of trade the benchmark S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent up at 927.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 8,634.81 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,830.06.Best Buy, the biggest US electronics retailer, slipped after reporting earnings roughly in line with analysts’ expectations. The company was expected to benefit from the demise of Circuit City, one of its main competitors, and even though it maintained its full year guidance, the shares fell 4 per cent to $37.11.Meanwhile shares in Adobe rose ahead of its earnings, which were due out after the bell. The company said it would start charging for the online version of its Acrobat reader program after moving the product out of public testing stage. The shares advanced 0.4 per cent to $28.93.Citigroup slipped 0.6 per cent to $3.35 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, told the Detroit Economic Club’s National Summit that companies were going to have to look away from American consumption for growth drivers as the US faces slower growth and less credit. The fall came in spite of reports that five companies were in the bidding for its Japanese asset management arm, a deal which could earn the bank $1bn.The telecoms sector suffered a difficult morning after Barclays Capital said investors were likely to move out of the sector, with continuing high unemployment making growth difficult to achieve. Barcap downgraded AT&T, which fell 1.1 per cent to $24.38 but retained its overweight rating on rival Verizon, despite cutting its price target to $34. Verizon’s shares were a fraction lower at $29.72.Research in Motion, meanwhile, maker of the Blackberry mobile device, unveiled a new model which aims to compete globally with Apple’s iPhone. Its shares gained 3.1 per cent to $82.86.Amgen, the Nasdaq-listed biotechnology company, climbed 2.5 per cent to $50.69 after its shares were upgraded by the broker Sanford Bernstein, which said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the next year.European stocks were higher early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was up 0.2 per cent at 865.01. Asian equity markets slid for a second consecutive session, with the Hang Seng index losing 3.1 per cent to 17,946.48.Bond yields were up, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note rising 2 basis points to 1.24 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note gaining 3bp to 3.74 per cent.The dollar was weaker against major currencies early in New York, losing 0.6 per cent against sterling to $1.64.Gold was trading $0.67 higher at $934.48 per troy ounce.Oil prices were up early in New York. US crude prices were $1.48 higher at $72.10 a barrel.
443;COP;Conocophillips;2009-06-15T20:28:46Z;Commodity and consumer groups suffer steep falls on Wall Street;;US stocks dropped sharply on Monday as commodity prices weakened and investors worried about the pace of economic recovery.Commodity stocks surged during the first four sessions of last week, as the price of oil rose and the dollar dropped amid rising fears of inflation.However, they fell back on Friday and continued to give up those gains on Monday. ConocoPhillips lost 2.9 per cent to $43.10 while Schlumberger dropped 2.8 per cent to $58.59.Steelmakers, which were some of last week’s biggest beneficiaries, also dropped sharply. AK Steel gave up 8.1 per cent to $18.32 while US Steel declined 5.7 per cent to $37.10.Commodity producers were hampered by a strengthening dollar, which was boosted when the Russian finance minister said there was “no alternative” to the dollar as a reserve currency.Data showing that manufacturing in the New York area was falling much more than expected during June and that sentiment among homebuilders had dipped exacerbated the falls.These factors added to cautious words over the weekend from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, who warned that discussions about “exit strategies” from stimulus plans might be premature.Mr Strauss-Kahn said: “We haven’t exited the crisis yet.”Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: “Things are so weak we would expect them to continue to improve for quite a few months, but in some cases the improvement is petering out already, which is quite disappointing.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.4 per cent down at 923.72 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent to 8,612.13 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.3 per cent to 1,816.38 points.The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge spiked nearly 10 per cent back over the 30 level. Consumer stocks also suffered. Wal-Mart fell 2.8 per cent to $48.46, hurt by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which said sales growth at the retailer would begin to fall.Although Goldman said investors could move into more discretionary stocks as the recovery continues, others warned that the consumer sector would continue to suffer.“People are starting to realise that even when the economy recovers, certain sectors such as consumer spending are going to remain under pressure,” said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital. “This is a realisation stage for the markets.”There were negative signs on the amount of loan losses that financial companies still face. Capital One, the credit card lender, said the number of card defaults had risen in May compared with April. Its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $23.40.Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities, warned that Bank of America was experiencing “horrific” loan losses. BofA shares fell 2.8 per cent to $13.33. Also in the sector, shares in Lincoln National dropped after the company became the second large insurer, after Hartford Financial, to say it would take government bail-out money and raise further capital by issuing shares.The company said it would sell up to $900m of new stock, and its shares dropped 10.8 per cent to $15.83 on fears of dilution.Housebuilders were some of the day’s biggest fallers after the homebuilder confidence figures. Centex sank 3 per cent to $8.23 while KB Home, which also suffered a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, dropped 6 per cent to $13.24. There was further bad news for the airline industry after executives at European aircraft maker Airbus warned that output at its European factories could fall by as much as a quarter over the next two years.Shares in Airbus’s US rival Boeing fell 3.7 per cent to $49.52 but shares in other major airlines were worse affected, as research suggested business class flights on Delta Air Lines and American Airlines had halved in price.Delta lost 4.7 per cent to $6.10, while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, gave up 2.6 per cent to $4.43.
444;COP;Conocophillips;2009-06-12T20:43:55Z;Wall Street rebounds in late trade;;Wall Street stocks erased most of their early losses on Friday, but they failed to break out of the week’s narrow trading range on a day when floor trading in 242 companies, including Exxon Mobil and General Electric, was halted because of a computer problem.Stocks rebounded in late trade as early indications filtered through that Mir Hossein Mousavi, the challenger to President Mahjmoud Ahmedi-Nejad, might be on course to win a majority of the vote.The broad market had been subdued all week, as surging commodities lifted energy and materials stocks, but squeezed the consumer sector.Oil peaked at more than $73 a barrel on Thursday, but then fell back again on Friday. Its movement was matched by that of leading energy producers.Schlumberger rose 8.6 per cent in the first four sessions of the week, but fell 3.1 per cent on Friday to $60.27. ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $44.37.Metal producers also lost some of the week’s gains as the boom in prices for their products slowed. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 3.2 per cent to $58.51. AK Steel, the steel maker that has surged over 13 per cent this week, fell 5.7 per cent to $19.93.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.1 per cent at 946.21, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 8,799.26, pushing the blue chip benchmark into positive territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 0.2 per cent to 1,858.80 points.“We’ve had a really good run up on commodities and there is a certain amount of covering positions ahead of the weekend,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.“Some managers will also be looking to lock in profits before the end of the quarter.”That left the S&P 0.7 per cent ahead of where it closed last week, while the Dow rose 0.4 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 0.5 per cent.The market spent the week focused on interest rates and the threat of inflation as climbing commodity prices were further fuelled by a falling dollar and climbing bond yields.Last week’s better-than-expected fall in non-farm payrolls triggered worries that an improving economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.“Inflation is a serious threat, perhaps not in three to six months, but in 12 to 18 months, and we have been investing in inflation protection assets,” said Charles Zhang, managing partner of Zhang Financial.BlackRock finally confirmed its $13.5bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors on Thursday to create the world’s largest money manager.The impending deal had been widely reported during the week, sending BlackRock’s shares up 5 per cent.The final price was a shade over the $13bn that had been reported, however, which sent BlackRock’s shares down 3.3 per cent at $176.56.The company was also hit by a downgrade in its credit rating from S&P following the deal, which will give it an extra $3bn of debt.Elsewhere in the sector, Hartford Financial, the insurer and financial services company, said it would take $3.4bn in government bail-out money and sell $750m of stock amid what it called a “continued uncertain economic environment”. This sent the company’s shares down 8 per cent to $12.95.In the technology sector, National Semiconductor shares fell after it reported a loss.The microchip maker had better sales than expected, but had to pay $100m in restructuring costs, leading to a worse loss than had been predicted.Its shares dropped 6.1 per cent to $13.59.Other microchip companies suffered. Texas Instruments lost 0.2 per cent to $20.79 while market leader Intel gave up 0.2 per cent to $16.31.
445;COP;Conocophillips;2009-06-10T20:45:54Z;Wall St slips on disappointing US debt sale;;US stocks slipped on Wednesday afternoon after a disappointing auction of government debt triggered a slump that was then erased by some positive economic news from the Federal Reserve.Equities had been drifting during the day, but took a noticeable dip after the end of the auction, which failed to attract the kind of bids the market was hoping for, exacerbating fears that high bond yields would push up interest rates.They then recovered after the Fed said that there were signs the that the economic contraction in some areas of the US was moderating.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite both closed down 0.4 per cent at 939.15 and 1,853.08 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 8,739.02.“The economy is not falling quite so fast, but the big question is not how fast do we recover but how far do we recover. That is why stocks can’t break out of this range,” said Kim Caughey, investment analyst at Fort Pitt.Fears that rising interest rates would curb consumer spending took their toll on financial and consumer stocks.Morgan Stanley, which had been trading lower throughout the day after Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of rival Goldman Sachs, said the recession would be long and protracted, dropped further. Its shares closed down 5.6 per cent at $29.26. Goldman was 1.8 per cent lower at $146.68.Investors were particularly worried that mortgage rates would continue to rise on the back of higher bond yields. The recent climb in rates saw mortgage applications fall more than 7 per cent last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said on Wednesday.“Rising yields have been keeping a lid on stocks recently as falling bond prices attract investors away from equities,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo Advisers.Charles Zhang, managing partner of Zhang Financial, said inflation remained a serious long-term worry. “The US government will have to increase yields to make Treasury bonds attractive,” he said.Citigroup rose however as it got its long-awaited $58bn stock swap under way, the day after the board met Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in an effort to diffuse growing tensions between the two parties. The shares rose 2.1 per cent to $3.48.Big name consumer stocks also suffered, including McDonald’s, which dropped 1.2 per cent to $58.36 and Disney, which lost 0.9 per cent to $25.10.Even the home improvement retailers, which had performed well in the morning after Home Depot improved its full-year profit outlook on better profit margins, later slipped back. Home Depot finished 0.2 per cent up at $24.39 while rival Lowe’s dropped 0.4 per cent to $20.37.Brown-Forman was one of the few consumer stocks to hold onto its gains after it reported better results than expected.The company, which owns the Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort drinks brands, saw sales fall less than analysts had predicted and its shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $46.74.Earlier energy companies had risen on the price of oil, which briefly topped $71 for the first time since October.Despite losing some gains ExxonMobil hung on to gains of 1 per cent to $73.84, while ConocoPhillips rose 0.5 per cent to $45.76.Metal producers had initially fared well on rising raw materials prices, but later in the day, only steel manufacturers continued to hold their gains. AK Steel was 5.2 per cent up at $20.09 while US Steel gained 6.1 per cent to $40.13. Meanwhile Ameriprise became the latest in a long line of financial companies to announce that it would issue shares in order to raise further capital. The financial services company said it might use the money to make acquisitions, although it did not name specific targets. Its shares fell 7.3 per cent to $26.33.Elsewhere, shares in real estate broker CB Richard Ellis rose 13.6 per cent to $9.25 after the company said it would raise $400m by selling bonds and a further $100m by selling shares to Paulson & Co, the hedge fund. It said it may use the money to repay debt.
446;COP;Conocophillips;2009-06-10T15:19:08Z;Oil rise boosts US energy stocks;;US stocks rose on Wednesday morning as Wall Street remained focused on inflation indicators, with commodity prices continuing to rise and the dollar slipping further.The price of oil briefly topped $71 for the first time since October last year, but then fell back. By mid-morning US crude was up $0.97 at $70.98.This boosted energy stocks, including Chevron, which gained 1.8 per cent to $71.43 and ConocoPhillips, which picked up 1.9 per cent to $46.40.Other commodities also continued the week’s gains, with rising metals prices driving shares in Alcoa, the aluminium producer, which rose 3.1 per cent to $11.50 and Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, which advanced 2.6 per cent to $60.47.Materials ane energy stocks drove the benchmark S&P 500 index higher, and after half an hour of trade, it was 0.4 per cent up at 946.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 8,812.26 but the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 1,856.38.Home Depot boosted the consumer sector after it said profits may be flat this year, having previously forecast a 7 per cent decline. The company reaffirmed its sales targets, but said profit margins could be slightly higher. Its shares lifted 1.9 per cent to $24.80.The news also helped rival home improvement retailer Lowe’s find gains, picking up 0.9 per cent to $20.65.Brown-Forman added to the optimism on consumer spending after it reported better results than expected. The company, which owns the Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort drink brands, saw sales fall less than analysts had predicted and its shares climbed 2.8 per cent to $46.55.Banking stocks were sluggish on the growing signs of inflation and economic data showing mortgage applications fell over 7 per cent last week.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which both said on Tuesday that they had been granted permission to repay money from the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, saw their price targets lifted at JPMorgan, which cited the strength of the companies’ fixed income units.But shares in both companies fell after Lloyd Bankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, said the current upturn in global markets did not signal the end of the recession, saying it would be long and protracted. Shares in Goldman lost 0.9 per cent to $147.91 while Morgan Stanley fell 2.4 per cent to $30.25.Citigroup finally got its long awaited $58bn stock swap under way, the day after the board met Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Desposit Insurance Corporation, in an effort to diffuse growing tensions between the two parties. Even though Ms Bair did not address the position of Vikram Pandit, the chief executive whom the regulator is pushing to replace, people close to the matter said the meeting had a conciliatory tone. The shares rose 4.7 per cent to $3.57.Meanwhile Ameriprise became the latest in a long line of financial companies to announce it would issue shares in order to raise further capital. The financial services company said it might use the money to make acquisitions, although it didn’t name specific targets. Its shares fell 9.2 per cent to $25.79.Elsewhere, shares in real estate broker CB Richard Ellis spiked 15.5 per cent to $9.40 after the company said it will raise $400m by selling bonds and a further $100m by selling shares to Paulson & Co, the hedge fund. The company also said it may sell up to $50m more in equity and use the money to pay off debt.European stocks were higher early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was up 1.7 per cent at 884.31. Asian equity markets closed mainly up, led by the Nikkei 225 average, which closed 2.1 per cent higher at 9,991.49Bond yields were generally up, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rising 2 basis point to 3.876 per cent although that on the two-year note fell 1bp to 1.294 per cent.The dollar was weaker against major currencies early in New York, losing 0.7 per cent against the pound to $1.64.Gold was trading $0.01 higher at $954.79 per troy ounce.
447;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Santos welcomes discussions over coal bed;;Santos, the Australian energy group, said it would welcome “collaborative discussions” with rivals from the UK, US and Australia that are also seeking to develop the vast coal bed methane gas reserves in central Queensland.David Knox, chief executive of Santos, which has formed a partnership with Petronas of Malaysia to develop its Queensland reserves, singled out the UK’s BG Group – which has bought two Australian developers valued at A$6.6bn ($5.3bn) since October – and a consortium comprising Australia’s Origin Energy and ConocoPhillips of the US.“They are the key ones,” Mr Knox said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We are …open to talks if they think it is in their interests to join us.”The Queensland industry for coal bed methane – liquefied natural gas produced from coal deposits – is in its infancy but has attracted interest from four large consortiums, including a venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Australia’s Arrow Energy, and three smaller groupings.The parties aim to convert the coal bed methane into liquefied natural gas before it is transported to Asian energy markets.Analysts say the consortiums will need to consolidate, probably into two main groupings.BG was regarded as a front-runner last month after it was the first to sign a large customer when it agreed a deal with CNOOC of China. But Mr Knox said it helped all parties.“It demonstrated that coal bed methane to LNG is accepted by the market. By 2013 and 2014, there will be strong demand for LNG in Asia as a number of projects come off. I don’t view this as a race,” he said, and added that Santos was in a “strong position”.Santos aimed to reach a “final investment decision” on its venture in the first six months of 2010, ahead of its rivals, with maiden gas shipments in 2014.It has 12 customised rigs operating and plans to build a 435km pipeline, capable of supporting three trains – LNG production lines – at its Curtis Island processing plant at Gladstone, Queensland.Mr Knox said talks with a “number of Asian customers” were advanced and he expected a deal in the coming months.“Japanese buyers are excellent foundation customers but the Japanese economy is having a difficult time so it’s hard for them to sign up,” Mr Knox said.Rick Wilkinson, president of Gladstone LNG, the Santos/Petronas joint venture, said an “off-take” deal might also allow for a customer to take a large minority equity stake.“Demand is growing in China and they believe in this story,” he said.All consortiums are subject to the vagaries of world energy prices but the key to LNG’s relative profitability is the link between gas and oil prices.“Right now that linkage is quite strong,” Mr Knox said.BG attempted to buy Origin last year with an A$13.8bn cash takeover offer but the bid was rejected by the Australian group, a move that soured relations between the two and may hinder a future tie-up.Apart from China and Japan, prospective markets include Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore.
448;COP;Conocophillips;2009-05-26T04:25:09Z;US oil market: Policies that will hit the gas tank and the world;;"Barack Obama’s energy and environmental policies will undoubtedly affect climate change, the car industry, power companies and taxpayers’ wallets. But one of the most striking effects of the US president’s policies could be a move away from petrol, the fuel that has powered cars for more than 100 years.Analysts and oil company executives say Washington’s call for a cap and trade system for carbon emissions, its recent decision to demand higher vehicle efficiency standards and its continued support for biofuels will be noticeable far beyond US borders.Mr Obama says he intends to cut US oil demand by 4m barrels a day – equal to the combined consumption of France and Canada – and he has begun to announce policies to make that a reality.This month the White House revealed it would use California’s strict efficiency and emissions rules as a guide for a new national standard for cars and light trucks. By 2016, such vehicles sold in the US will have to achieve 35 miles to the gallon, a 30 per cent improvement.This is expected to have serious effects on consumption patterns.Today, the US’s use of oil and its products stands slightly above 20m barrels a day, about a quarter of the world’s total. Even though the US is the world’s third largest oil producer – pumping about 10 per cent of the total supply – imports still make up more than half its total requirements.The government policies that will change those statistics began to take effect even before Mr Obama moved into the White House, as analysts have pointed out.Johannes Benigni, managing director of JBC Energy, a Vienna-based analyst group, says energy legislation dating from 2007, the recent spike in oil prices and the recession were already undercutting US demand for petrol.US petrol consumption is likely to fall by 117,000 b/d each year until 2015 – or the same amount by which it rose in each of the five years to 2007. It is expected to have fallen by 2m b/d by the end of the next decade, as existing ethanol regulations take effect, JBC said.The change will be so big that the US, the world’s largest petrol importer, is expected to become a net exporter of the fuel by 2023. Mr Obama’s efficiency moves and support for ethanol will reinforce this, Mr Benigni says.This comes as Europe increasingly moves from petrol to diesel cars in the name of efficiency. This has seen the continent exporting petrol to the US and importing diesel from there.If US carmakers produce diesel cars to meet the new requirements, as some have told the government they will, analysts expect a surplus of petrol and shortage of diesel in the US. That will shift trade flows and perhaps push oil prices higher as drivers scramble for diesel.Even ExxonMobil, the biggest oil company, believes US petrol consumption is about to peak.But ExxonMobil, with its big cash pile and diversified portfolio, is likely to suffer less than US refiners already struggling under the weight of state-by-state environmental regulations and poor profit margins.Charles Drevna, president of the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association, the trade group, warned that putting refiners out of business by forcing them to blend increasing amounts of ethanol into feedstock would also affect production of chemicals critical for such staples as plastics and medicines.“If you are not going to continue making gasoline, you are not going to continue running a refinery that also makes petrochemical building blocks,” Mr Drevna says.And US refiners are not getting a break on cap and trade. Under legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, two influential Democrats, only a small fraction of the permits that would be distributed to the biggest carbon dioxide emitters have been earmarked for refiners.ConocoPhillips, the US’s third-largest energy group, warned this could have dire consequences. It said: “The current emission allowance allocation proposal in the bill fails to provide adequate protection to domestic refiners from unregulated foreign competition and leaves the sector exposed to undue economic harm.“The reduction in US refining capacity that could result from this policy would lead to increased imports of transportation fuel, erosion of national energy security, and loss of American jobs.”But foreign refiners are struggling as well and because US consumption represents almost half global demand, Washington’s drive to reduce it will be felt far beyond the country’s borders, where existing refineries are closing and those in the planning stages are being abandoned.Only 30 of the 160 construction projects announced since 2005 will go ahead in the face of a collapse in demand, Wood Mackenzie, the industry consultants, concludes.There will also be a shift as demand declines in Europe and the US and increases in the Middle East and Asia. Wood Mackenzie expects that two-thirds of the world’s refining capacity to be built over the next two to seven years will be in the Middle East and Asia.Ironically, this runs counter to the stated aims of both Mr Obama and his predecessor – both have talked of reducing US dependence on the Middle East.But, as the Rand Corporation recently concluded, cutting imports does not improve energy security; cutting consumption and increasing supply does.But even that has a catch. As the US moves away from oil and petrol, it is becoming less important as a consumer. This means Washington will lose influence among producers, such as those in the Middle East, to China and other growing centres of demand.That matters because oil will remain America’s most important transport fuel for years to come, in spite of its policies to nurture conservation and alternatives."
449;COP;Conocophillips;2009-05-26T04:25:08Z;Australian gas: Producers need to be sure the price is right;;"A couple of years ago, if you had tried to predict the next hot areas for investment in the global oil and gas industry, eastern Australia would probably not have been top of the list.Yet the country’s openness to foreign investment and lavish endowment of natural resources has made it one of the most popular areas in the world for takeovers and development projects in the past 18 months.In particular, international companies have been drawn to eastern Australia’s vast reserves of coal-bed methane, or coal seam gas as it is known locally: natural gas produced from coal deposits.The problem has always been finding a way to turn those resources into revenues. Now, many companies believe they have the answer, although there are still formidable obstacles.For some of the companies that have plunged so enthusiastically into Australia, the adventure is likely to prove a disappointment.The coal-bed rush has been led by companies such as BG Group of the UK, Petronas of Malaysia and ConocoPhillips of the US, who have seen an opportunity to use coal-bed methane to serve the lucrative gas markets of Asia.Singapore, South Korea, Japan and above all China are the targets: markets with steady demand for gas and, in China’s case, enticing growth potential.The companies plan to convert the methane into liquefied natural gas, super-cooled to about minus 160 degrees centigrade, so it shrinks in volume and can be transported by tanker.For as long as coal has been mined, the methane found in many seams has been known, mainly as a perennial hazard for miners. It is the reason why canaries used to be taken underground.Extracting the gas is relatively straightforward: the biggest problem is that the gas is often accompanied by large amounts of water that have to be disposed of. Also, although the gas wells are relatively cheap to drill, they produce gas at very low volumes. A large development requires thousands of wells.The slow rate of output from coal-bed methane wells creates a potential problem for converting the gas to LNG: a process that has not yet been proved commercially.An LNG “train”, as the liquefaction facilities are known, requires a steady throughput of gas to keep it running, and economies of scale mean the most cost-effective trains have to process very high volumes.BG’s planned two-train LNG plant in Queensland will produce 7.4m tonnes of LNG, equivalent to about 10bn cubic metres of gas a year: enough to meet one-sixth of China’s demand.BG and the other companies pushing ahead with methane to LNG projects are confident the process is commercially viable. Others have their doubts.Shell, Europe’s biggest oil company, has also invested in Queensland, setting up a joint venture with Arrow Energy of Australia.Jeroen van der Veer, Shell’s chief executive, suggests the company’s interests in Australia are more focused on conventional LNG projects, including Gorgon, the vast Chevron-led development off the north-west coast, which is expected to get the go-ahead this year. Shell has a 25 per cent stake.Mr van der Veer says coal-bed methane is “an interesting and promising technology”, but warns “you need pretty good world market prices in order to export. This is because coal seam gas is not the cheapest gas to produce.”Today’s depressed prices do not affect any of the coal-bed methane to LNG plans now under evaluation; the earliest is expected to come onstream only in 2014. But to commit themselves to the huge investments required, companies will have to be confident Asian demand will be strong enough.The gas prices needed to make a project viable are the higher the greater the cost of the investment. Conoco, which was generally seen by analysts as having agreed a very full price when it promised $8bn for a coal-bed methane to LNG joint venture with Australia’s Origin Energy last September, risks starting off at a competitive disadvantage.Frank Harris of Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, has argued that there may not be buyers for all the LNG that companies hope to produce in Queensland.The decisive factor may be the ability to secure markets for their planned production, and in that competition BG appears to have given itself a head start, signing long-term supply deals with Singapore, Chile – which is part of the same Pacific market – and most recently China. Its deal with CNOOC of China commits BG to sales of almost half the planned output of its LNG plant: enough to meet 8 per cent of China’s gas demand today.With BG edging ahead, the projects backed by Origin and Conoco, and a rival plan from Petronas and Santos of Australia, may be forced to merge. Certainly, they are unlikely all to be winners.But in this new market, with a new production process, the next moves may be as unpredictable as Australia’s sudden rise to popularity."
450;COP;Conocophillips;2009-05-26T04:25:08Z;Middle East: Oil-rich region faces gas shortfall;;It may seem a strange idea in the region of the world that is richest in hydrocarbons, but it is one that has been raising increasing concerns: the possibility of a critical gas shortage in Middle East.The countries of the region, particularly the wealthy Arab Gulf states, have one of the fastest growing rates of energy demand, as populations swell and the accumulation of petrodollars during the recent oil boom has driven rapid economic expansion.But they are finding to their cost that, after years of focusing on oil production, too little attention was paid to gas, which is now needed for power generation, desalination plants and to provide feedstock to the energy-intensive industries they have been seeking to lure.By some estimates, the cumulative supply shortfall for the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council up to 2015 will be at least 7,000bn cubic feet. Of the GCC members – Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain – only Qatar, which has the world’s third largest proven gas reserves and the largest natural gas field, can avoid the problem.The recent economic slowdown, which has caused a swathe of projects to be put on hold, will alleviate some of the short-term pressures. But, experts say, the medium and long-term outlook remains critical.“The long-term issue of ensuring adequate gas supplies to fuel growth has not gone away,” says Rajnish Goswami, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultants. “We see, with the exception of Qatar and Iran, every other country in the region facing challenges in ensuring supply growth.”Qatar is already piping 2bn cu ft a day to the United Arab Emirates, and is expected to provide around 1m tons of LNG to Dubai from 2010, analysts say. Kuwait has also been in talks with Qatar over gas imports, while Bahrain has been in discussions to buy gas from Iran – in spite of concerns from the US.Yet, neither Qatar nor Iran will necessarily provide answers to their neighbours’ predicament. Qatar has a moratorium in place on new projects in its North Field that is expected to remain until at least 2013 while a study is conducted into the reservoir. And even when it is lifted, there will be no guarantees that Qatar will look to the region.When recently asked if Qatar would be under pressure to help meet gas demand from its neighbours, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, the energy minister, was straighttalking.“If this study [in the North Field] shows we can produce more gas, then we will put this gas in a judgment where we should use it. Then we will see what is the added value, what is the best for us to sell it in the region or convert it to LNG or GTL,” Mr Attiyah says.“At the end of the day I am concerned about what is the best revenue for the country,” he explains. “I’m not in a social security game. I’m business-oriented here and we will see.”Iran is unlikely to provide a solution in the near future, because of global and regional politics. Observers believe that Bahrain’s discussions with Iran are in part designed to get its key allies, the US and Saudi Arabia, to press Qatar to help Manama meet its demand.Mr Goswami says Gulf policymakers are aware of the gas issue, but warns that much needs to be done.“In our view, the steps that have been taken may be adequate in terms of near- to mid-term planning, but, on a 10-year view, the supply challenge is pretty enormous and more still needs to be done,” he says.Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait, already burn fuel for power generation, and they are expected to have to divert more oil to domestic use rather than exports. This creates an opportunity cost, has impact on global supply and an obvious environmental effect.Saudi Arabia has been boosted by discoveries in the Karan field – its first non-associated offshore gas discovery – which it hopes will produce 1.8bn cu ft a day. Contracts for the field’s development were awarded this year. But a second project involving international companies in the Empty Quarter has yet to produce discoveries, and experts warn that gas shortages will become a serious issue for the kingdom.“It will not be an issue for the next couple of years,” says John Sfakianakis, chief economist at SABB Bank.“But if they continue to build like this, develop industry and do not become more efficient and do not find more gas, it will become a crisis.”Kuwait has also begun producing from its first non-associated gas field, but hydrocarbons development in that nation has been stymied for years by political disputes between the government and parliament.In the UAE, meanwhile, the authorities are considering developing a peaceful nuclear energy programme to supply base-load electricity after concluding that national peak electricity demand will rise to more than 40,000MW by 2020.They estimate that the known volumes of natural gas that could be made available for electricity would provide adequate fuel for only 20,000MW to 25,000MW by that time.Abu Dhabi, the UAE’s capital and home to 95 per cent of the nation’s hydrocarbons resources, is developing a sour gas field after awarding a contract to ConocoPhillips last July. But experts say the completion date for that project – originally set at 2012 – is expected to be significantly delayed.The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) is also looking at developing new gas fields and building a pipeline to enable the emirate to utilise its offshore gas.Still, the fact that such a pipeline needs to be built “demonstrates that there was not an appreciation for the way that gas demand would grow, so I think the country has been caught a little off-guard by that”, acknowledges an official.The emirate’s authorities are now investing heavily in renewable energy technology in an attempt to help meet demand.“We are at a decision point in our energy future and what Abu Dhabi is trying to do is to avoid having to fall into the default GCC model, which is using as much gas as you have got and then diverting your crude production to domestic energy consumption,” the official says.“Most people don’t recognise it, but the Middle East has one of the world’s fastest growing rates of [power] demand on a percentage basis of any region, and the net effect is a lot of crude oil is getting diverted to the electricity sector.“If we don’t find solutions, that diversion rate will get even greater in the future, putting significant new pressures on global crude markets and reducing the amount of new exports available from important Middle East producers.”
451;COP;Conocophillips;2009-05-20T20:30:06Z;Fed forecast sours Wall Street mood;;"US stocks suffered a late sell-off on Wednesday as a downward revision to growth figures and the progress of a bill to overhaul credit card lending helped tip the markets into negative territory.Banks led the selling after the Fed’s open market committee released the minutes from its last meeting, in which it lowered its predictions for GDP and raised those for unemployement.They saw another dip on reports that President Barack Obama was ready to sign the credit card bill, which would limit fees and impose new restrictions on when lenders can raise interest rates for risky customers.American Express lost 3.3 per cent to $23.98, while JPMorgan, which also has a sizeable credit card lending arm, gave up 3.5 per cent to $34.55.Oher banks also fell back after participating in the early rally.Regions Financial said it wanted to raise $1.25bn by offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s stress tests on banks.Investors worried about stock dilution and its shares fell 6.7 per cent to $4.89.PNC, meanwhile, fell 2.8 per cent to $42.06 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money but do so “over the next couple of years”.This contrasted with statements from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days that they would pay back the government as soon as possible.The falls reversed earlier earlier gains after the market took confidence from higher commodities prices and Bank of America’s success in raising capital.Bank of America’s shares rose after the company said it had sold a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last
Friday. The stock closed up 2.1 per cent at $11.49.“Bank of America’s rise is a kneejerk reaction and we are not seeing that replicated across the banking sector,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.5 per cent to 903.47, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average list 0.6 per cent to 8,422.04. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,727.84.Broader support came from energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel following Department of Energy figures showing US oil inventories fell last week.Schlumberger gained 1.9 per cent to $55.04, while rival ConocoPhillips picked up
0.6 per cent to $46.19.A rise in general commodity prices and the falling dollar also boosted materials companies. Newmont Mining, which produces gold, gained 4.5 per cent to $45.55, while Freeport McMoRan, which mines gold and copper, rose 1 per cent to $50.Hewlett-Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after reporting earnings in line with analysts’ estimates.Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.67 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below current consensus predictions.Its rival, Dell, also suffered from the negative outlook for the computer sales industry and its shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $11.18.But chip manufacturers lent strength to the technology sector after Analog Devices’ profits beat Wall Street’s estimates and the company said it would earn more for the full year than currently predicted.The company said there had been strength in sales to telecommunications infrastructure customers and
its shares jumped 15.7 per cent to $23.80.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 6.6 per cent to $13.23 and 2.5 per cent to $4.50, respectively.Investors also watched for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJâ€™s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits. Target’s shares gained 2.4 per cent to $42.94 after it beat expectations on the back of tight cost controls and a profitable credit card business.BJ’s also beat predictions as consumers looked to buy staples at wholesale prices. But its shares slipped 4.4 per cent to $36.37 after the company said it expected second-quarter sales to decline.On a quiet day with low volumes, however, most investors were not overly worried by the losses.“It looks like there has been a continual but moderate consolidation of the big gains on Monday,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo advisers."
452;COP;Conocophillips;2009-05-19T19:12:53Z;Exxon’s M&A inaction puzzles analysts;;With a record of $60bn in cash flow from operating activities last year, ExxonMobil appeared poised to embark on an acquisition spree this year, as the economic downturn, credit crisis and falling oil and gas prices puts pressure on its less-profitable competitors.“Of all the majors, ExxonMobil clearly has the greatest ability, and some may say the stimulus, to go out and buy in future production growth,’’ Neil McMahon, senior analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in one of the first research reports to broach the subject at the start of this year.Given the barriers thrown up by nationalistic state-owned oil companies that control more than 80 per cent of the world’s oil reserves, it would seem to make perfect sense for a cash-rich company experiencing intensifying difficulty to access new oil fields to buy its way into fresh production channels.Yet, at a meeting with analysts in March, Rex Tillerson, Exxon chairman and chief executive, said the time for mergers and acquisitions had not come, with the market still in a state of flux: “It has not settled, in my view.’’With oil prices now on their way up again, analysts begin to wonder whether Exxon has any intention of making material purchases. The company’s analyst meeting takes place a week from Wednesday. Several shareholders have floated the idea that Exxon might be as big as it is going to get.At $344bn, it is already the world’s largest company by market capitalisation.“Exxon may have reached the point of dis-economy of scale,’’ says Mark Flannery, analyst at Credit Suisse Global Energy. “Have they scaled themselves up to a point where they are significantly bigger than their available investment opportunities? They are so big versus the suite of available investment opportunities, they cannot really deploy enough capital into new projects to maintain operating momentum and keep the capital cycle turning.’’Nor should they, say other analysts. Exxon’s portfolio is based on very large, efficient, long-life assets, says Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. Similar assets, such as Chevron’s leading stake in the Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia, would be unlikely to come up for sale, as they represent the “crown jewels’’ of competing oil majors’ portfolios.If Exxon made any attempt to buy a company holding such assets outright – such as ConocoPhillips or BG Group – it would probably provoke antitrust or political concerns, given its enormous size and the billions it would have to pay.By contrast, taking over a series of smaller, less premium assets would weaken Exxon’s portfolio, which it managed tightly last year with a more than 50 per cent return on average capital employed in its exploration and production division.Buying might not be the right move. “Bigger is not necessarily better,” Mr West says.Besides, he adds, Exxon’s continued funding of its massive share buy-back programme is a signal it does not see any extraordinary opportunities. Exxon has $7bn of share purchases planned for the first quarter, after spending $35.7bn on buy-backs last year.The share buy-back plan has provoked criticism that Exxon is not identifying enough growth opportunities and is slowly liquidating itself. Last year’s shareholder meeting was marked by calls for it to invest heavily in renewables – a position some shareholders plan to take again this year.That Exxon has not bought any assets is no surprise to David Barrowman, vice-president of energy consulting for Wood Mackenzie. He notes that Exxon has no history of growing by acquisition, unlike rival ConocoPhillips.Since its mega-merger with Mobil, Exxon has focused on organic growth and on joint-development projects with national oil companies that require its expertise in areas such as liquified natural gas.Whether it intends to pursue this strategy remains to be seen. Mr Tillerson gives no clues.He told analysts in March: “We’ve got the capacity to do any number of things. We look at those all the time.’’
453;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BG and CNOOC sign landmark LNG deal;;BG, the British gas and oil group, has signed a deal with China National Offshore Oil Corporation to sell liquefied natural gas from BG’s planned plant in Australia, opening up a new supply route to Asia.CNOOC has agreed to buy 3.6m tonnes of LNG a year for 20 years and is taking small stakes in BG’s LNG plant and some of its gas fields. The supply represents about 5.3bn cubic metres of gas a year – about 8 per cent of China’s present demand.The deal is China’s first commitment to gas imports from eastern Australia’s huge reserves of coal bed methane – natural gas produced from coal deposits.Queensland’s coal bed methane resources have been one of the world’s most active areas for new gas projects over the past year. The CNOOC deal puts BG in the lead in the race to develop those reserves for LNG – gas supercooled to -160°C so it can be shipped in tankers.BG has made two acquisitions in Australia – the Queensland Gas Company and Pure Energy – to provide the resources to supply its proposed LNG plant on the east coast, which it wants to have on stream in 2014.Other international groups have similar plans, including a consortium of Santos of Australia and Petronas of Malaysia, and another of Origin Energy of Australia and ConocoPhillips of the US.Royal Dutch Shell, with its Australian partner Arrow Energy, has also taken an interest but Shell has played down the prospect of a rapid development there.Converting coal bed methane to LNG uses well-established technology, but has never been proved as a commercial proposition.The CNOOC deal, signed by the companies’ chief executives in Beijing on Tuesday, gives BG the confidence to go ahead with its proposed plant, knowing that almost half its planned output of 7.4m tonnes of LNG a year has already been sold.BG has also signed long-term supply deals for LNG with Singapore and Chile that could also be served from Australia.Frank Harris of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, said: “A year ago, if you had the gas, you could be confident that someone would buy it but that has changed. Now it is a buyer’s market and sellers need to get on and secure the market before it disappears.”He added it was possible that a lack of customers could force the Santos/Petronas and Origin/Conoco projects to combine.The details of the agreement between BG and CNOOC have yet to be finalised. Neither side gave any indication of the price at which the gas would be sold.The two companies will also set up a consortium to own two LNG tankers to ship the LNG to China.
454;COP;Conocophillips;2009-05-11T16:07:40Z;Chávez seizures fuel Venezuela oil fears;;A fresh round of expropriations in Venezuela has raised fears that the Opec producer’s already declining oil output could sink to its lowest level in the past 20 years.Troops were mobilised over the weekend to assist Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, in seizing the assets of some 60 oil service companies, after a law was approved last week that paves the way for the state to take increasing control over its all-important oil industry.“To God what is God’s, and to Caesar what is Caesar’s,” said Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez, as he presided over the expropriation of more than 30 oil terminals and some 300 boats.“Today we also say: to the people what is the people’s,” the socialist leader said to roars of approval from red-clad supporters on the shores of Lake Maracaibo, the heartland of the nation’s oil production.This move forms part of a broader assault against the private sector, which Mr Chávez has increasingly blamed as Venezuela slides into recession. Simultaneously he is engaging in what opposition leaders say is a campaign of persecution of his political foes.Manuel Rosales, a former presidential candidate, has been granted asylum in Peru to escape arrest over corruption charges, while congress has removed almost all the spending powers of Antonio Ledezma, the anti-Chávez mayor of Caracas. Other opponents have been jailed or gone into hiding.PDVSA, which is suffering from a sharp fall in export income, made the surprise move against the oil service companies in response to their threat that they would suspend operations until it paid a backlog of invoices. Some, including Helmerich & Payne and Ensco International, abandoned rigs this year.PDVSA, which is under pressure to cut expenses by 60 per cent because of tumbling revenues, is estimated to owe as much as $12bn (€8.9bn, £7.9bn) to contractors since suspending payments to them last August, shortly after oil prices began their precipitous decline.It has demanded that companies accept a 40 per cent cut in their bills, arguing that the decline in oil prices means they are charging too much.The new law will also enable PDVSA to pay debts with bonds rather than cash, and compensate assets at book value.The move is the latest sign of the deepening cashflow crisis that has bedeviled the state oil company for at least two years as it has become overburdened with responsibilities far removed from its core business – in particular funding and running the massive social programmes that have become the bedrock of Mr Chávez’s support.But analysts say that by shifting its problems onto its suppliers, PDVSA is storing up even bigger problems for the future. Not only does it lack the ability to operate as efficiently as the service providers, but it sends a grim signal to companies considering investing in Venezuela. Consequently, future oil production is under threat.Perhaps most worrying is the impact this could have on foreign companies’ interest in a major auction currently underway to develop the Carabobo block in the oil-rich Orinoco Belt, which is the first oil investment opportunity in Venezuela in the last decade, and represents the oil dependent country’s biggest hope for reviving sagging production. According to the IEA, production fell to 2.36m bpd in 2008, compared to 3.18m bpd in 1997, although PDVSA claims it actually increased to 3.27m bpd in 2008.Some 19 companies – including BP, Chevron, Shell, StatoilHydro, and Total – have expressed interest in bidding for the Carabobo projects that could collectively produce over 800,000 bpd, and require investments of $25-30bn.But adding to worries about the lack of legal security in Venezuela, intensified by recent developments, international oil companies are also concerned by prohibitively high start-up and financing costs as well as tight profit margins due to fiscal terms that were drawn up before oil prices began their precipitous decline last year.David Voght, a director at IPD Latin America, which advises several international oil companies operating in Venezuela, said: “Venezuela’s aggressive fiscal terms and the country’s persistent trend toward nationalisation of oil industry activities will make it more and more difficult to attract foreign investment and competitive bids from qualified operators.”Taxes and royalties have been hiked four times since 2004, with an 85 per cent windfall tax introduced last year, while companies were ordered to give up operational control over four multibillion-dollar projects in the Orinoco two years ago, prompting Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips to exit the country and opt for international arbitration.Although most companies are keen to have a stake in Venezuela, which now claims to have 172bn barrels of proven oil reserves making them the second largest in the world after Saudi Arabia, the government’s unpredictability and inflexibility are a serious deterrent.“It’s a great paradox. There are companies that want to invest in Venezuela and to remain on a long-term basis, bringing capital, technology and know-how, but they may not do so because the government is refusing to recognize that the outlook for oil prices has changed,” said an industry source in Caracas, who requested anonymity. “They have to face up to reality.”
455;COP;Conocophillips;2009-05-08T18:56:51Z;Financials lead Wall St higher;;"Wall Street responded positively as banks rushed to the market to offer new equity on Friday following the results of the government’s stress tests.Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley were the first two banks to act, raising $7.5bn each – Wells purely through equity and Morgan Stanley through equity and debt.Wells sold its shares at $22, but its stock traded higher than that. By mid-
afternoon its shares were up 6.1 per cent at $26.26. Morgan Stanley fell 0.4 per cent to $27.24.Other banks saw sharp rises after the results of the tests showed that they had to raise less money to survive the government’s most adverse scenario than many had feared.Citigroup rose 7.1 per cent to $4.08 after it said it would raise the additional $5.5bn of capital it needed by expanding its scheme to convert preference shares into common stock.Bank of America also moved higher, building on gains of more than 55 per cent for the week after its capital needs were found to be $33.9bn, as previously reported.The bank said it would raise the money without converting any of its government-held preferred shares into common stock, so avoiding a majority-government holding. That helped its shares pick up 3.9 per cent to $14.03, which Ken Lewis, chief executive, admitted was “counter-intuitive”, given the risk of dilution from a $17bn equity raising.Regional banks also performed well, even though several were found to need to bolster their balance sheets. Fifth Third was the biggest gainer, soaring 57.3 per cent to $8.41.“Investors were more concerned about government involvement than dilution,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com. “They thought the government was going to be the only one contributing
capital, which would be a losing game.”This followed a week of leaks and rumours surrounding the results of the tests, during which the market had continued to rally.By Friday afternoon, the benchmark S&P 500 was 1.6 per cent higher at 922.16 points, putting it on course for a weekly gain of 5.1 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.3 per cent to 8,517.30, towards a rise of 3.8 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite index headed towards a much smaller weekly gain as investors began to take profits following its recent outperformance. The Nasdaq rose 0.5 per cent on Friday to 1,725.52 points, 0.4 per cent up for the week.Meanwhile the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell over 10 per cent during the week as investors bet on more stable market conditions in the short to medium term.Futures dipped before the market opened on Friday morning after the release of the unemployment figures for April. Although fewer non-farm employees lost their jobs in April than analysts had estimated, many investors believed the consensus estimates were overly bearish.They focused instead on an upward revision in March’s figures as well as the fact that employment was boosted by new, but short-term, government jobs.Stocks were able to hold on to gains during Friday though, helped by materials stocks that were boosted by rising commodity prices.Alcoa, the aluminium maker, gained 1.9 per cent to $10.04, while Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, rose 5.3 per cent to $51.65.Shares in energy producers also performed well as the price of oil continued its recent rally. Schlumberger rose 3.9 per cent to $56.22 while ConocoPhillips gained 6.1 per cent to $46.42.Elsewhere, CBS, the broadcaster, reported a surprise loss as revenues from advertising slumped. The shares rose 2 per cent to $8.22 however after Fred Reynolds, chief financial officer, said the company could meet its obligations until 2012 without issuing more debt."
456;COP;Conocophillips;2009-05-01T22:13:31Z;Buffett’s big day;Lessons have been learnt;"It may be called “Woodstock for capitalists”, but the vibe at this year’s Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting may be less about peace and love and more about the bottom line.Investing legend Warren Buffett looks a little flat after his worst performance in Berkshire’s 43-year history. To his credit, he has changed the meeting’s format to have shareholder questions focus on the company rather than the more typical digging for pearls of wisdom from Mr Buffett and sidekick Charlie Munger. Some shareholder questions will be vetted by a trio of financial journalists and others through a lottery rather than a rush for the microphones – a system that had become unwieldy given the expected record attendance of 35,000 people.Investors will almost certainly ask Mr Buffett, who once described derivatives as “financial weapons of mass destruction”, about the $37bn in puts Berkshire wrote on various equity indices that have produced big paper losses. Some are also fretting over the $15bn in plain and hybrid debt he bought from Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electricduring the credit crunch.Another question mark will be his unusually poor timing in buying ConocoPhillips shares as the oil bubble neared bursting point last year. Finally, investors might wonder what will happen to that Berkshire magic after Mr Buffett, 78, and Mr Munger, 85, move on.Anyone expecting Mr Buffett to be defensive will be disappointed. Few bosses are so quick to admit their mistakes or, more important, learn from them. He has little to apologise for given his record of producing 84 times the return of equities overall since 1965. Even 2008’s annus horribilis trounced the overall S&P 500 by 27 percentage points. The meeting may be more focused this year. But in discussing how he aims to profit from the credit crisis, Mr Buffett should still impart plenty of wisdom.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

458;COP;Conocophillips;2009-05-01T20:44:43Z;Oil rise overcomes Wall St bank uncertainty;;"US stocks edged higher on Friday as the rising oil price overcame uncertainty over banks’ balance sheets and Wall Street completed its seventh week of gains in eight.Chevron gained 1.2 per cent to $66.87 even after re­porting a 64 per cent decline in quarterly profit to its lowest level in five years, missing Wall Street’s expectations in the process.Its larger rival Exxon Mobil also saw gains, a day after it reported worse results than expected. Its shares picked up 2 per cent to $68.01.Meanwhile, Conoco Phillips, which last week beat analysts’ expectations with its first-quarter earnings, rose 3.7 per cent to $42.50.During the week, the market managed to shrug off fears over swine flu, a worse contraction in the US economy than expected and a delay in the results of the government’s stress tests on banks to finish higher.The benchmark S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.5 per cent. This was the Nasdaq’s eighth straight week of gains.But banking stocks finished on a low note after reports said the results of the government’s stress tests would be delayed from Monday until Thursday May 7 as banks debated the results and the government considered the best way to release the information.But Bill Webb, deputy chief investment officer of Gluskin Sheff, said: “I think investors are taking some comfort from the fact that the government has come up with a pragmatic process for the stress tests.”The general uncertainty weighed on confidence, which was also hit
by JPMorgan lowering its earnings forecasts for several institutions. Analysts warned: “We expect credit deterioration to persist, led by rising unemployment and continued sharp declines in home prices.”Bank of America closed down 2.6 per cent at $8.70 while Wells Fargo fell 2 per cent to $19.61.Morgan Stanley jumped, however, after John Mack, the chief executive, denied reports the company was looking to buy a regional bank. Its shares rose 9.2 per cent to $25.82.The markets took extra confidence from figures showing that the decline in manufacturing had slowed during April.The S&P 500 and the Dow both rose 0.5 per cent to 877.52 and 8,212.41, respectively. The Nasdaq gained 0.1 per cent to 1,719.20.Equities were also feeling the fall-out from several disappointing earnings announcements, especially in the financial sector.Mastercard became the second leading credit card company in two days to beat analysts’ estimates with its results. It saw some gains on Thursday after better-than- expected results at Visa lifted the sector as a whole but fell back on Friday as investors worried about falling revenues. Its shares lost 5.8 per cent to $172.90.MetLife, the biggest US life insurer, felt the effect of the recent market falls as performance in its investments dragged it to its first quarterly loss since 2001.Even excluding the investment performance, the company made a smaller profit than Wall Street had expected and its shares fell 7.7 per cent to $27.45.Hartford the insurer and financial services company, also suffered from the stock market crash as it was forced to pay out more on policies protecting customers from losses on investment accounts. This took the company to its third straight quarterly loss and its shares fell 7.9 per cent to $10.56.Aon, the insurance broker, was the third company in the sector to report falling revenues from investments. The company increased profits but fell short of analysts’ predictions and the shares lost 13.8 per cent to $36.38.Mr Webb said: “We have seen a lot of volatility this week but stocks have not moved outside of their recent range. It wouldn’t surprise me if the next few years are like this.”"
459;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Buffett faces a grilling from investors;;Warren Buffett will be under pressure at Saturday’s annual gathering of faithful shareholders to explain his worst year ever, with the usually adoring crowd set to probe the legendary investor on his bargain-hunting strategy, succession plans and views of the crisis.Buffett-watchers say this year’s meeting of shareholders in Berkshire Hathaway, his candies-to-insurance group, will depart from the usual pattern of deferential questions and folksy answers and witness some criticism of the billionaire investor.“The hard questions will be asked this year,” said James Altucher, a hedge fund manager and author of Trade Like Warren Buffett. “There will be people who always stand by him and others who will ask: ‘Have you lost your way?’”.Berkshire was unavailable for comment. But people close to Mr Buffett say he has been preparing for tough questions from some of the 25,000-plus investors expected to converge on his native Omaha to attend an event he once called “the Woodstock for capitalists”.Mr Buffett’s supporters say his long-term record remains stellar and vastly superior to the stock market and that, even during a tough 2008, Berkshire’s shares outperformed major indices and most fund managers.But criticism of the “Sage of Omaha” would be particularly unwelcome at a time when the 78-year-old investor is looking to preserve his legacy and pick a successor for the roles of both chief executive and chief investment officer.As the financial crisis and the global economic slowdown raged, Mr Buffett stayed true to his “value investing” credo, buying stakes in blue chips such as Goldman Sachs and General Electric whose shares had slumped. But his motto of being “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful” could not prevent Berkshire from losing 9.6 per cent in book value per share – the metric that Mr Buffett uses to measure his performance – in 2008. That was Berkshire’s worst performance since 1965 when Mr Buffett bought a struggling textile-maker and turned it into a wildly successful investment vehicle.“I think he took his eye off the ball a bit,” said Douglas Kass, a general partner at the hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management, who reversed his short position on Berkshire recently and began buying the stock. “He was encumbered by a buy-and-hold strategy which to some degree ignored the carnage that was going on.”Mr Buffett has admitted doing “some dumb things” last year, such as buying shares in the oil group ConocoPhillips when crude prices were at a peak and purchasing stock in two small Irish banks whose price later plummeted.His call to retail investors to buy shares in US companies, made in a New York Times editorial in October, has also not worked out. The S&P 500 is about 6 per cent below levels seen when Mr Buffett wrote the article. But he has always maintained he is unconcerned by short-term market movements because of his long-term outlook.His performance in 2008, for example, was hit by his large exposure to the ailing US financial sector, which includes stakes in American Express and Wells Fargo. Yet the recent rally in banking stocks appears to have helped Berkshire, whose shares have risen more than 30 per cent since their lows in March.Additional reporting by John Authers
460;COP;Conocophillips;2009-04-23T14:50:12Z;Conoco back in the black;;ConocoPhillips, the US’ third biggest oil and gas company, swung back to profitability in the first quarter, beating analysts’ forecasts as operating costs fell amid the downturn.Conoco reported first-quarter earnings of $840m, or 56 cents per share, down sharply from $4.1bn, or $2.62 per share, in the year-earlier period. But, nonetheless, it was an improvement from the previous quarter.For the 2008 fourth-quarter, Conoco reported a net loss of $31.8bn, hit by plunging commodity prices and a massive $34bn write-down on the ensuing reduction in its asset values.In the first quarter of 2009, Conoco said lower commodity prices were partially offset by lower operating costs, lower production taxes and higher volumes.The company’s refining and marketing segment reported first-quarter earnings of $205m, compared with adjusted earnings of $753m in the previous quarter and earnings of $520m in the first quarter of 2008.This reflected a 70 per cent decline in worldwide marketing margins, in addition to lower volumes because of increased turnaround activity in the US.Revenues were $30.7bn, down from $54.9bn a year ago.
461;COP;Conocophillips;2009-04-19T21:58:32Z;Producers run low to beat recession;;When oil and natural gas prices dropped sharply at the end of last year, Swift Energy found itself with 60-70 per cent less revenue over a period of only a few months.Bruce Vincent, president of the small exploration and production company, has been scrambling to cut costs: “We can’t do it as fast as the price drops.”Swift’s strong balance sheet has helped mitigate the impact. But Mr Vincent was forced to begin 2009 with a 75 per cent cut in capital spending plans. He stopped drilling in some areas and laid off 11 per cent of his staff – 40 people.“It’s hard to do on a human level,” Mr Vincent says. “It’s really gut-wrenching.”He is not alone in feeling the impact of falling commodity prices, the credit squeeze and economic downturn. With even big names, such as ConocoPhillips and Schlumberger, forced to lay off staff and scale back, it is no surprise many of the small, independent producers, which drill 90 per cent of US wells, are in real trouble.In recent months, there have been eight announcements of forced sales, bankruptcy filings and notices of possible filings, with the most recent warning coming from Edge Petroleum in March.These are not immaterial companies: 56 per cent of US natural gas and 59 per cent of US oil is produced from companies with under 20 employees, according to the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which has 5,000 members.“While most of us think about the industry as ‘Big Oil’, the reality is that the majority of American oil production is produced by small businesses,” says Barry Russell, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. “These companies may not be well-known, but we are the safety net from increased reliance on foreign oil.”And they are laying down their drilling rigs at an alarming rate, according to Richard Mason, publisher of the Land Rig Newsletter.The number of land rigs operating in the US has fallen by 1,000, or 48 per cent, since the October 2008 peak, he said – the steepest drop, on a percentage basis, since the 1980s oil crisis.“We have seen 20,000 employees disappear in the last 90 days,” Mr Mason said.Texas, the energy capital of the world, has just gone into recession, with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas attributing the slowdown to the deepening global financial crisis, as well as declines in energy prices, high-tech activity and exports.Texas’ unemployment rate rose sharply from 4.4 per cent in June to 6 per cent in December, versus the US rate’s increase from 5.6 per cent to 6.8 per cent. The state is feeling the slowdown in the land-based natural gas market, in particular: Texas produces nearly one third of US natural gas, and employs almost half the workers in the US oil and gas extraction industry.“As drilling activity slows, layoffs are becoming widespread in the energy industry and are expected to grow in 2009”, the Federal Reserve said.Against this backdrop, 50 chief executives with the 400-member Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States told Washington this month how detrimental tax increases they are proposing would be to the small companies doing most US drilling and production. They include companies such as Great Western Oil & Gas, GMT Exploration, Black Hills Exploration & Production and Mesa Energy Partners.“These tax breaks are so we drill and not pay the tax man,’’ said Association member Jerry McHugh, chief executive of San Juan Resources, which has an interest in more than 100 wells. The global downturn already has made drilling difficult without tax increases: “I had four wells I was going to drill and operate last year that I had to pull the plug on.’’Stephen Chazen, president and chief financial officer of Occidental Petroleum, a low debt business, says that the difference this time is that producers took on more debt than usual and used hedging to keep spending at high levels to capitalise on oil prices.The oil price rose to a record $147 a barrel last year before falling to this year's $40-$50 range, and natural gas prices rose to more than $13 per million British thermal units before falling to below $4. This will make a recovery more difficult.“People somehow convinced themselves this time was different,’’ Mr Chazen said.……………………………….Smaller companies bracing themselves for crippling tax increasesSmall oil groups are braced for crippling tax increases set to be imposed by the Obama administration’s attempts to fund its $3,000bn budget.The administration intends to tap the oil and gas industry, raising $31bn over the next decade by cutting tax breaks. The industry is an obvious target following billions in profits for major oil companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron.Ken Salazar, secretary of the interior, said the federal government received one of the world’s lowest shares of revenue for oil and gas resources and must re-examine how the federal government is compensated for extraction on its lands.“That means we are going to take another look at royalty rates,” Mr Salazar said. “It means that tax breaks that are no longer needed – and which the American people can't afford – will disappear.”The industry fears the tax increases will damage the small companies producing most US oil and gas, undermining energy independence and security.The president’s draft budget would also repeal expense allowances on intangible drilling costs – similar to those given to other manufacturing and production industries.According to the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States, without such allowances, the US natural gas industry could be “crippled overnight’’ and capital normally reinvested in US energy reduced by 30-50 per cent.Larry Nichols, chief executive of Devon Energy, an independent oil and gas producer, warns that oil companies with fewer than 20 employees – they produce 56 per cent of US natural gas and 59 per cent of oil – will bear the brunt when they can least afford to. “They’re desperate for money,” he says.
462;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chevron’s warns on first quarter profit fall;;Chevron, the world’s third largest oil company by market capitalisation, has set the tone for bad news from the energy sector, saying earnings for the first quarter of 2009 should be “sharply lower” than the previous quarter.Earnings for its exploration and production division are expected to “decline substantially”, partly because of lower prices for crude oil and natural gas.Its refining and marketing segment also will produce “much lower” earnings, given that average margins on the sale of refined products are “off significantly”.The fact that oil majors such as Chevron are feeling the impact of sharply lower commodity prices and the economic downturn is a bad sign for the rest of the energy sector, which has fewer assets and cash and more borrowings.ConocoPhillips, the third largest oil company in the US, warned last week that its first-quarter results would also be affected by the poor operating environment. It pointed to lower oil and gas prices, as well as a decline in marketing and international refining margins.Yet the industry’s hopes for the medium term remain intact, with Chevron reporting a rise in production during the first two months of the quarter.This was due to ongoing restoration activities following last year’s hurricanes, and the ramping up of new fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Kazakhstan and offshore Nigeria.In the refining and marketing division, results were less positive, with margins in the US decreasing significantly. Although the prices of oil and gas as feedstocks for the refining industry have declined, so has demand for the finished products.The second-largest U.S. oil company said on Thursday the earnings would include $100 million in write-offs associated with exploration, and that the fourth quarter included a $650 million foreign-exchange benefit as the dollar weakened as well as $600 million from an asset-exchange transaction.Chevron shares fell 1.8 percent to $67.99 after-hours, while shares of larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp handed back a big part of their 1.3 percent regular-trade gain.Chevron also said U.S. oil-equivalent production in January and February was 660,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from 619,000 in the fourth quarter, while international production was 1.985 million bpd, up from the previous quarter and a year before.First-quarter refining margins were down nearly across the board from a year ago, hit particularly hard in the past month by a recovery in crude oil prices, which increases input costs. Margins had improved in Northwest Europe from near break-even a year before, but were down from the fourth quarter.Benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude prices averaged about $43 a barrel in the first quarter, 56 percent lower than in the same quarter last year. The quarter’s average price of natural gas for delivery at Henry Hub was $4.73 per million British thermal units, down 44 percent from last year.Chevron is due to report first-quarter results on May 1. Analysts had been expecting a net profit before items of $2.03 billion, or 94 cents per share, on revenue of $23.11 billion. In the same quarter last year, the company earned $2.48 per share on revenue of nearly $66 billion.A week ago, rival ConocoPhillips said first-quarter earnings would be hurt by weakness in North American natural gas prices and that its worldwide margins would be significantly lower.Marathon Oil Corp is expected to give its quarterly update next week.Chevron’s stock closed on Thursday at $69.23, up $13 from its low in early March when it was within sight of its lowest levels for nearly three years. A rally in energy prices and the stock market lifted the entire industry in the past month.Chevron shares are down 6 percent so far in 2009, broadly in line with peers tracked by the Chicago Board Options Exchange oil index
463;COP;Conocophillips;2009-04-09T03:52:53Z;Russian investors face ‘political antagonism’;;Russian investors are being driven from eastern Europe because of political antagonism in countries such as Poland and Lithuania, one of Russia’s most important businessmen has warned.Leonid Fedun, vice president of Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil company, said in an interview: ”Some countries in eastern Europe have an extreme level of political antagonism towards Russia. So speaking of investments in Poland and Lithuania is ridiculous at this point.”Lukoil, which is 20 per cent owned by the US’s ConocoPhillips and relatively independent of Kremlin influence compared with its peers, was believed to have been interested in two refineries owned by PKN Orlen, the Polish energy group, in which the Polish government has a 27 per cent stake.The two refineries are located in the Czech Republic and Lithuania. Analysts said Lukoil’s involvement would make good business sense, but agreed political hurdles were high.Mr Fedun’s comments come a week after Mol, the Hungarian energy group, and Hungarian politicians reacted with fury over the acquisition by Surgutneftegaz, the Russian energy company, of the 21 per cent stake in Mol, which had been held by OMV, the Austrian energy group.Zsolt Hernadi, Mol’s chairman, accused the Austrians of acting as a front for the Russians, and politicians promised to raise the barriers to such acquisitions even further.Poland has no significant Russian investments, and energy is a particularly delicate area because of worries that Russia would use it dominance in energy as a political tool to undermine Polish independence.Russia’s case was not helped by this year’s gas dispute with Ukraine, which slashed gas deliveries to the EU.Polish governments have vociferously opposed the construction of the Nordstream pipeline, which is supposed to run under the Baltic connecting Russia directly to Germany while omitting central European transit countries. Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland’s foreign minister, even compared it once to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact which led to Poland’s partition in 1939.Warsaw is also committed to building a liquefied natural gas terminal on the Baltic coast to avoid dependence on Russia.The skittishness in central Europe over Russian energy investments does not apply to other areas of the economy.Aeroflot, the state-owned Russian airline, has submitted one of four bids to buy CSA, the Czech airline, which is being sold later this year. The offer, seen as the most serious for the airline, provoked some political grumbling but no action to exclude the Russians.Even Poland, long seen as the most suspicious in central Europe towards Russian investment, has not excluded a potential Aeroflot investment in LOT, the money haemorrhaging state airline.“I have no political bias, of course we cannot ignore the eastern market,” Sebastian Mikosz, LOT’s newly appointed acting CEO, said in an interview with Poland’s Rzeczpospolita daily.Earlier this year, Hungary’s Socialist government brokered a deal to save Malev, the struggling privatised flag carrier, by handing a significant minority stake to VEB, a Russian state-owned bank.Additional reporting by Will Conroy in Prague
464;COP;Conocophillips;2009-03-15T23:32:11Z;Shell scores poorly on emissions disclosure;;Royal Dutch Shell’s disclosure of its carbon emissions lags behind its closest rivals and falls well short of best practice, a study by an industry consultant has said.PFC Energy said Shell, which has sought to assert its green credentials, was rated bottom out of six multi­national oil companies surveyed on the level of detail, frequency and coherency of emissions disclosures.PFC said BP was ranked highest, setting the standard for its peers. Even ExxonMobil, traditionally seen as a sceptic of global warming, was rated above Shell. The findings come days after the US announced it would force all big emitters of greenhouse gases to disclose comprehensive emissions data by 2011. They also come as Shell prepares for its annual strategy presentation Tuesday, when it will include the latest emissions data in a filing to US regulators.PFC, which based its rankings on publicly available data from corporate sustainability reports, annual reports and corporate websites, scored Shell at 1.15 out of 5 on its carbon disclosures. That compares with 3.65 for BP, 2.76 for Exxon, 2.64 for Conoco­Phillips, 2.4 for Chevron and 2.03 for Total.PFC said Shell’s performance on disclosure raised questions about its internal organisation – five years after Shell was hit by a scandal when it was revealed that oil and gas reserves had been overstated.“The possibility exists that the upheaval Shell has experienced over the last decade – the reserves writedown and massive corporate and business reorganisations – has made it difficult for the group to quantify its emissions thoroughly,” PFC said.Shell pointed out that it had been rated more highly on a broader set of criteria by Carbon Disclosure Project, a UK-based charity. Taking into account factors such as environmental awareness, CDP has ranked Shell at 68 out of 100, compared with 74 for Chevron, 64 for BP and Total, ExxonMobil 53 and ConocoPhillips 46.“It is still early days on GHG [greenhouse gas] reporting. No one knows yet what information will most help stakeholders to judge companies’ responses to climate change risks,” Shell said. “But what is clear is that transparency must be judged widely: not only numbers on company’s emissions but understanding how well companies understand and manage risks …It is regrettable that this (PFC) study did not take that wider perspective.”
465;COP;Conocophillips;2009-03-15T22:56:45Z;State-owned groups pursue energy assets;;"State-controlled companies have continued to buy oil and gas assets even as merger and acquisition activity has slumped over the past year, the leading industry survey of deals has shown.Acquisitions by national oil companies and sovereign wealth funds reached a record high last year as a proportion of total deals, according to the survey from IHS Herold, an oil and gas advisory firm, and Standard Chartered, the bank.The survey also shows how new “unconventional” sources of oil and gas have become an increasingly important focus of M&A activity. Acquisitions of both companies and oil and gas fields slowed sharply in the second half of last year, as the credit crisis intensified following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September. The total value of deals for 2008 stood at $104bn – the lowest for four years and down 32 per cent on 2007. The subdued trend has continued into this year.The most active sector was “unconventional” gas, produced from rocks where it has not previously been possible to extract it. The year’s biggest deal in the worldwide oil and gas industry was the $5.9bn spent by ConocoPhillips of the US to buy into a coal-bed methane project with Origin Energy of Australia. The country’s reserves of coal-bed methane – gas produced from coal seams – were one of the few hot spots for deals worldwide. However, national oil companies and sovereign funds stepped up their M&A activity, accounting for a record 15 per cent of the total value of deals last year.State-controlled companies have also become more internationally ambitious, with the value of their acquisitions outside their home countries rising from about $12bn in 2007 to $16bn in 2008. The indications so far are that they are likely to remain active, in spite of the global economic downturn.After being the most active buyers of oil and gas assets among the state-controlled companies in 2005-06, the Chinese groups went quiet in 2007, but returned to the market last year. China has this year promised loans to Russian and Brazilian companies to invest in oil developments, according to advisers in London.India emerged as a significant buyer for the first time last year. The biggest corporate deal from an emerging market buyer was the £1.4bn ($1.9bn) acquisition of Imperial Energy, the London-listed Russian oil company, by ONGC Videsh of India.Herold and Standard Chartered expect acquisitions by private sector companies to pick up over the next year.Chris Sheehan, director of M&A Research, IHS Herold, said: “You tend to get most consolidation in an industry down cycle.”However, there are barriers to consolidation, including a shortage of finance. Even western oil groups, such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which have access to the capital markets, are cutting costs and being careful with their cash.Ed Tockman, director of oil and gas advisory at Standard Chartered, said: “For deals to happen, both sides of the transaction need an equilibrium of expectations. Some further alignment of buyers’ and sellers’ expectations has to come about before there are more transactions, and today the outlook is still very uncertain.”As companies run out of cash, however, and hopes of a quick return to an oil price of $100 per barrel fade, the pressure to do deals will mount; a position described in a research note last week by analysts at Sanford Bernstein as a “ticking time bomb” for M&A."
466;COP;Conocophillips;2009-03-10T23:19:01Z;Oil-rich nations ‘seek majors’ expertise’;;"Dave O’Reilly, chief executive of Chevron, said the oil-rich countries that erected barriers to international oil companies amid the run-up in commodity prices were now seeking their expertise in managing the drastic fall.“They’re back now looking for [our] investment,’’ Mr O’Reilly told Chevron’s annual analysts’ meeting.The high prices had led countries such as Venezuela and Russia to raise barriers to the international oil companies, which have gone from control of 85 per cent of the world’s oil reserves in 1970 to less than 10 per cent now.With prices on the rise, these countries did not feel they had to be as careful with their resources; some began managing their own oil and gas and failed to reinvest adequate profits to maintain production.in 2007, Venezuela nationalised the energy sector and expropriated the assets of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, which disagreed with the new terms offered.But oil prices have dropped from $147 a barrel last year to $48 a barrel, and US natural gas prices have fallen from more than $13 per million British thermal units to below $4.The oil-rich nations now require the expertise of the international oil companies to get costs down and grow production to maintain their economies. “This is a time they need companies like ours more than ever,’’ Mr O’Reilly said. “That threat [to further nationalise] has receded quite a bit.’’Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive, agreed, noting Exxon had been around for more than 100 years and had vast experience with the rise and fall in commodity prices.The jury was still out, he said, on how the Russians would handle it: “They did not see this coming; they are dealing with it in real time.’’He said Exxon was still embroiled in arbitration negotiations with Venezuela over the expropriation of its assets there.However, he said the delays on the Sakhalin 1 project were not due to the crisis but rather to changes on the Russian side of the board regulating the project, which meant new people did not understand the project and, therefore, did not approve processes as quickly.Mr O’Reilly said Chevron was in a strong position, never having been “caught up in $140 oil’’.It had a long queue of future projects and did not need to find opportunities in the downturn, although it would keep its eyes open.“We have a tremendous suite of opportunities and are not dependent on these opportunities to grow our portfolios,’’ Mr O’Reilly said.Chevron would focus on reducing the cost of doing business, which had grown inflated with the rise in prices.It recognised it must not press vendors too hard, however, so they were healthy enough to help Chevron when demand rebounded."
467;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Conoco caught out by lower oil prices;;"When ConocoPhillips became the first of the big oil groups to announce 2008 financial results, it was with a string of bad news.The third largest US oil company disclosed a 2008 fourth-quarter net loss of $31.8bn; a $34bn writedown; 1,300 in job losses; and a $2.8bn cut in capital spending. Jim Mulva, chief executive, predicted competitors would also announce bad news because of plunging commodity prices and the economic downturn.If they did not, Mr Mulva indicated, he would have to work that much harder, with details to come at Conoco’s annual analysts meeting on March 11.After Conoco’s grim announcement, Chevron said it would slow investments on some projects and BP said it would freeze its dividend, but none of the majors announced anything as drastic as Conoco. Indeed, ExxonMobil pledged to spend $29bn this year as planned.Mr Mulva must produce a convincing recovery strategy to appease investors, including Warren Buffett, the billionaire US investor, who said in his annual note to shareholders that buying Conoco stock when commodity prices were near their peak was “a major mistake”.Since his purchase, oil prices have dropped from just under $147 a barrel last year to about $40 a barrel, and natural gas prices from more than $13 per million British thermal units to below $4.“I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year,” Mr Buffett said. “I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40-$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong.”Mr Mulva should have known better; energy prices have a history of dramatically rising and falling, and the other groups were not making plans based on such inflated prices. Yet he continued his acquisition spree, even as analysts criticised the deals as too expensive.Given what Neil McMahon, senior analyst at Bernstein Research, calls Conoco’s “poor reputation in the industry for finding oil”, Conoco put more money on a relative basis into acquisitions than its peers.Indeed, since 2003, he said, Conoco had spent the least of any of the big oil companies on exploration or development as a percentage of total capital expenditure, and the most on acquisitions. Analysts would like to see the opposite.Conoco’s $34bn writedown included $25.4bn related to exploration and production; a reduction of the carrying value of its equity investment in Lukoil, Russia’s largest privately owned oil company, by $7.3bn, and “other asset impairments” of $1.3bn, with the fall in commodity prices and equity markets to blame.Conoco’s Lukoil investment had a net loss for 2008 of $5.5bn, swinging from net income of $1.8bn in 2007 and leaving some wondering if Conoco had invested in Russia at its peak.“He made a bet in Russia which does not look good right now but from a strategic standpoint may look smart in the long term,” said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. Analysts have focused most intently on Conoco’s acquisition of Burlington Resources for $33.9bn in 2005, which Mr McMahon notes came in at a cost of $17 a barrel of proved reserves when the industry enterprise value per barrel of oil equivalent was about $10.Of the $33.9bn price, $16.6bn was attributed to goodwill, so Conoco’s goodwill doubled year over year, accounting for 19 per cent of total assets.Conoco’s recent Origin joint venture and Shah sour gas project are other deals in which Conoco’s pricing was criticised as “too aggressive”.Given the writedown, Mr McMahon estimates that Conoco’s ratio of goodwill to assets will drop to about 4 per cent, more in line with the other majors.“It seems that the company decided some time ago that it couldn’t change its exploration record, but decided to take a different approach, to buy its way out of the problem, hoping for escalating future oil prices,’’ Mr McMahon said.“Unfortunately, it has taken a low-price environment to expose the flaw in its current strategy.’’"
468;COP;Conocophillips;2009-03-06T19:36:32Z;Exxonerated;;"The notion that large and diversified companies fare better in a downturn has been soundly discredited by the financial crisis. While the consequences have been far less dramatic for oil and gas supermajors than for financial supermarkets, their broad geographic reach and involvement in every aspect of energy from exploration to fuel retail has been no saving grace – every link in the chain is weak.There is more than one way to buck the economic cycle though. Crude is $100 a barrel below its July peak and downstream margins have been pinched too, so it is hardly astonishing that BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are all freezing or cutting capital expenditures this year. The surprise is that ExxonMobil, the fifth and largest supermajor, will spend 11.1 per cent more. It is also considering acquisitions. This suggests that it was not being overly conservative, as some critics charged, during the boom – just frugal.In recent years, Exxon focused on low-hanging fruit, letting its rivals battle over more marginal projects that required higher commodity prices to be profitable. This is reflected in its reserve replacement cost, which was $6.48 per oil equivalent barrel between 2004 and 2007, lower even than BP with its cheap but risky Russian fields and less than half of Shell or Chevron.It instead returned the excess cash to shareholders. Combined buybacks and dividends as a percentage of its capital spending were four times that of Shell and more than double BP and Chevron during the past year. In spite of gaudy numbers, Exxon’s bosses seem to recognise that the energy business is no more profitable than others over a complete cycle. At the same time, assets are relatively long-lived. By being conservative when others were not, it avoided overpaying and, now that others are cutting back, it has less competition for new projects.

469;COP;Conocophillips;2009-03-02T09:12:34Z;Buffett’s bad year;;"It is a sure sign of extremes in financial markets when the Oracle of Omaha is said to be losing his touch. The last time tongues wagged this way was a decade ago when he was supposedly missing the investment opportunity of a lifetime by eschewing what later turned out to be fool’s gold in the tech bubble. This time, though, Berkshire Hathaway is coming out of the worst year in its 43-year history at a time when investors’ faith in financial expertise has been shaken.A little perspective is warranted here. Buffett’s stumble came during the worst year for equities since the 1930s and Berkshire’s book value fell only 9.6 per cent. In other words, it fared 27.4 percentage points better than the S&P500 when dividends are included. An investment with Buffett has returned 84 times that of equities overall since 1965.As in the past, he admits to some investment errors in timing and judgment – confessing, for example, that one of the “dumb things” he did was to buy a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock shortly before oil and gas prices collapsed. But Buffett usually plays the odds masterfully and now says risk is grossly overpriced. His still-enormous cash pile insulates him from disaster and allows him to be shrewdly opportunistic, even if, on occasion, he did not quite pick the bottom of the market. He thus betrays no concern over the $14.5bn in plain and hybrid debt he bought from Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. Investors are also jittery over $37bn in puts he wrote on various equity indices maturing in 15 to 20 years. His mark-to-market loss is already $10bn, or double the premium received. But, with no need to post collateral, stocks at 12-year lows and plenty of time remaining on those bets, his losses exist on only paper.As always, Buffett cares solely about value, not what the market thinks. Such pure objectivity is not only refreshing but also a contrarian buying signal for other brave, long-term investors. Consider what happened the last time he strayed so far from conventional wisdom.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

470;COP;Conocophillips;2009-02-10T00:43:04Z;BG’s bid turns up heat with rival Shell;;BG Group aims to compete against Royal Dutch Shell by deepening its presence in Australia’s fledgling coal seam gas industry, after launching a A$796m (£363m) takeover bid for Pure Energy Resources.The cash bid trumps a rival offer for Pure Energy from Australia’s Arrow Energy.It comes after BG, the oil and gas group, last October agreed to buy Queensland Gas Company in an A$5.6bn deal – the latest example of consolidation among smaller energy companies prompted by the falling price of oil and financial market turmoil. BG is now in the late stages of integrating Queensland Gas, which is based in the Surat Basin. BG has made repeated attempts to become a leader in Australian coal seam methane – gas found in coal deposits.Last year it abandoned a A$13.8bn takeover offer for Origin Energy, an Australian group with extensive coal-bed methane assets. BG’s offer was rejected by Origin’s board at the 11th hour with the Australian group subsequently agreeing a joint venture with ConocoPhillips, the US oil group, for A$9.6bn.Australia’s coal-bed methane is a relatively undeveloped resource that has attracted interest from several international groups.Royal Dutch Shell last year joined forces with Arrow Energy to develop projects in Australia and international markets.The Anglo-Dutch oil major agreed to invest up to A$776m to buy 30 per cent of Arrow’s coal bed methane acreage in Queensland and 10 per cent of its international assets. Arrow is also a leading shareholder in Pure Energy.BG’s offer for Pure Energy is pitched at A$6.40 a share, which compares with Pure Energy’s last traded price of A$5.28. The Australian group’s shares are in a trading halt.BG said that its cash offer was at an implied premium of 19 per cent compared with Arrow’s offer, which was worth A$5.39 based on Friday’s closing prices.BG underlined its desire to secure Pure Energy after saying it had taken a 10 per cent holding in its target’s shares “from a range of shareholders”.“[Our] offer gives Pure shareholders the certainty of cash at a time of heightened uncertainty in world equity and financial markets,” BG said.Analysts said that Arrow may take profits on its investment in Pure Energy. They also reckoned that Arrow itself may eventually become a takeover target.Its offer for Pure Energy is conditional on approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board and minimum acceptance of 50.1 per cent.Shares in BG on Monday closed down 8p at £10.77.
471;COP;Conocophillips;2009-02-03T20:15:55Z;BP sees challenges ahead;;"BP, Europe’s second-biggest listed oil company by market value, on Tuesday reported record profits of $25.6bn for 2008 but warned of “a much more challenging environment” because of the fall in oil and gas prices.Its results, which showed a 24 per cent drop in net income to $2.6bn for the fourth quarter, illustrated the difficulties that falling crude prices have caused large international oil groups.While the price of oil for immediate delivery has remained close to $40 per barrel over the past two months, longer-dated futures prices have been drifting steadily lower.The futures market implies a steep recovery in prices to about $55 per barrel in a year’s time.However, executives and analysts are planning for the prospect of oil staying at today’s levels for longer. That could put pressure on all companies and trigger a fresh round of mergers.Robin West of PFC Energy, the consultancy, said: “The bottom of the cycle presents huge challenges but also great opportunities. Those companies that have the strength will clearly prevail in the long run.”Bernstein Research has calculated that if oil stays at $35 per barrel, only ExxonMobil of the US and Total of France out of the leading international oil companies will be able to cover their investment programmes from their cash flow. BP and Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s biggest oil company, would have to borrow to cover capital spending, and then need more to pay dividends.The big oil company showing the greatest sign of strain at the moment, however, is ConocoPhillips, the third-largest in the US. In its results last week, it reported a $34bn writedown on asset values and 1,300 job cuts.Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse Global Energy said Conoco would have a tough task persuading investors it could weather $45 oil.Exxon, the world’s largest listed oil company, set a record for US company profits with 2008 net income of $45.2bn.Yet analysts have questioned its long-term strategy; it is spending a large amount on share buybacks – a planned $7bn this quarter – and commits a lower proportion of its cash flow to capital spending than its competitors.However, Bernstein suggested in a recent report that “2009 could be ExxonMobil’s year”.The company has $31bn of cash on its balance sheet, giving it the firepower to make large-scale acquisitions in the downturn."
472;COP;Conocophillips;2009-02-03T13:47:43Z;Wildcat strikes continue at UK oil refineries;;Wildcat strikes over the use of foreign labour at British oil refineries continued on Tuesday as hundreds of workers downed tools, marking a full week of protests.Hundreds of contractors at Total’s Lindsey oil refinery at Killingholme on the east coast continued their strike, while eight hundred were reported to have walked out in sympathy at nearby power plant and refinery owned by ConocoPhillips.Some contract workers also went on strike at Royal Dutch Shell’s Stanlow refinery on the west coast.The dispute stems from a decision by Total, the French owned oil company, to award a contract to expand the Killingholme plant to IREM, an Italian company that is using its permanent Italian and Portuguese staff to do the work.Talks between Total and union representatives brokered by the mediation service Acas entered their second day on Tuesday.Unions have pressed the government to tighten the existing law on the use of foreign workers. ”As the interpretation of the law now stands it is possible for overseas companies to refuse to employ UK nationals on projects in the UK,” the GMB union, which represents 600,000 workers, said in a statement.”The UK government should take the advice of the EU Parliament and press the EU Commission to correct this interpretation,” it added.Prime Minister Gordon Brown called the strikes “the wrong course of action,” backing a statement from Total that denies discrimination towards British workers.The week-long dispute has prompted a series of walkouts in sympathy at power plants across the country and triggered a debate on European laws on labour mobility as unemployment in recession-hit Britain surges towards two million.No disruptions in energy supply have been reported so far.
473;COP;Conocophillips;2009-01-31T18:14:10Z;ACAS called in as wildcat strikes spread;;"Ministers intervened at the weekend to try to prevent a spate of wildcat strikes over the use of foreign workers from escalating into more serious industrial unrest, as the recession heightened tensions over perceived threats to British jobs.Several thousand contract workers at more than a dozen oil refineries, gas terminals and power stations staged a series of illegal walk-outs on Friday in sympathy with a protest at Total’s oil refinery at Killinghome, Lincolnshire. The protests were triggered by the award of a contract to IREM, an Italian engineering company, which the strikers claim intends to bring in its own staff from Portugual and Italy.Peter Mandelson, business secretary, assured workers that he would make sure that “domestic UK law and European rules are being applied properly and fairly.”“But it would be a huge mistake to retreat from a policy where, within the rules, UK companies can operate in Europe and European companies can operate here,” Lord Mandelson said in a statement“Protectionism would be a sure fire way of turning recession into depression.”Pat McFadden, the employment minister, on Friday night asked ACAS, the independent arbitration body, to investigate allegations that British workers were being excluded illegally from working for certain foreign-owned construction firms.Downing Street also pledged action, promising the government would hold talks in the next few days with the construction industry “to ensure that they are doing all they can to support UK economy”.The dispute is politically fraught for the government, highlighting both fears about rising unemployment and the legal difficulties of trying to abide by Gordon Brown’s 2007 pledge to create British jobs for British workers. Mr McFadden on Friday rejected suggestions this commitment was inconsistent with Mr Brown’s anti-protectionist stance.“I don’t think Gordon Brown has ever said he is in favour of trade barriers or in favour of a situation where UK companies could not operate in Europe and European companies could not operate here,” he said.The government action came as the Total dispute spread across the country. Plants where walk-outs took place included ConocoPhillips’ Humber refinery; liquified natural gas terminals at Milford Haven in Wales; the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland operated by Ineos; BP’s Kinneil oil and gas terminal also at Grangemouth; Longannet and Cockenzie power stations in Scotland; ExxonMobil’s ethylene plant in Fife, Scotland; and Shell’s two Scottish gas plants.There were signs the unrest could spill over into next week. Some 900 contractors at Sellafield, the nuclear power station, plan to meet before work on Monday to discuss taking industrial action in support of the Lincolnshire workers.Oil companies and power station operators said on Friday that none of their own staff were involved in the stoppages, which affected contracted workers. No supplies or services had been disrupted by the strikes, which had taken place without legal ballots.Unite, Britain’s biggest union, said that it had raised the “problem of UK workers being excluded from important engineering and construction projects” with the prime minister and Ed Miliband, the energy secretary. Unite was unable to officially back the strikes without leaving itself open to legal claims.Walk-outs● 600 at Total’s Lindsey oil refinery, North Killingholme, Lincolnshire● 400 at ConocoPhillips’ Humber refinery, South Killingholme, Lincolnshire● 300 at ConocoPhillips’ Immingham combined heat and power plant, Lincolnshire● 100 at BP’s Dimlington gas terminal, Yorkshire● 100 at the Ineos oil refinery, Grangemouth, Scotland● 100 at BP’s Kinneil terminal, Grangemouth, Scotland● 400 at Scottish Power’s Longannet power station, Scotland● 70 at Scottish Power’s Cockenzie power station, Scotland● Fewer than 100 at Fiddler’s Ferry power station in Cheshire● Other stoppages were reported at the Dragon and South Hook liquified natural gas terminals in south Wales"
474;COP;Conocophillips;2009-01-30T19:18:08Z;Excellent ExxonMobil;;"Missing among the dozens of articles about how ExxonMobil on Friday broke its own record of being the most profitable company on the planet was any mention of the billions it could have made but did not.It was easy for an energy executive to look like a genius during the bull market in oil and gas prices that peaked last summer. Nearly every project was a winner, but Exxon’s executives applied a far higher hurdle rate, choosing to generate free cash flow as others invested.Some shareholders chided them for their conservatism. Added to this was sniping from environmentalists for failing to embrace green technologies to the same extent as some of its peers and by irate motorists for simply making so much money. Love them or hate them, Exxon’s bosses navigated the energy boom superbly and are now well positioned to make the most out of the bust.Last year they returned $40.1bn to shareholders through buybacks and dividends or 154 per cent of their capital investment and exploration spending. This is in sharp contrast to fellow supermajors. Royal Dutch Shell returned just 37 per cent of expenditures to shareholders. BP and Chevron were at 61 and 67 per cent, respectively, while ConocoPhillips was the next most prudent at 87 per cent.Meanwhile, the credit crunch has left some mid-tier oil companies poorly prepared to develop promising fields as internally generated cash flows slump. North American oil and gas companies now sport valuations that assume oil prices of $52.50 a barrel in perpetuity, according to Tudor Pickering & Holt.By contrast, equilibrium prices may be closer to $80, says the International Energy Agency. With big projects still elusive, these valuations have spurred talk of Exxon expanding reserves through acquisitions rather than the drill-bit. Like a value investor, it was fearful when others were greedy and now has the cash to be greedy when others are fearful.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

475;COP;Conocophillips;2009-01-30T16:15:44Z;Chevron’s profits boosted by one-time gain;;Chevron, the second biggest US oil company, reported a one-time asset-exchange gain which led to a rise in fourth-quarter net income, as commodity prices left its peers with falling profits or even losses.Chevron reported better-than-expected net income of $4.90bn, or $2.44 per share, up from $4.88bn, or $2.32 per share, a year earlier.That included a $600m gain on an asset-exchange transaction, as well as positive impacts from foreign-currency exchanges, which added net income of $478m, compared with a reduction to earnings of $2m in the fourth quarter of 2007.Chevron came off looking far better than its peers: Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips reported losses for the quarter, in which ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company, reported a 33 per cent drop in net income.Chevron has also been hit by the plunge in oil and natural gas prices. Revenues in the fourth quarter were $43bn, down 28 per cent from $60bn a year ago.Chevron’s shares were up 1 per cent at $71.31 in late morning trading.Even as its exploration and development segment was hit by the sharp decline in crude oil prices, earnings from its refining and marketing business improved as crude oil prices began to slide.This reduced feedstock costs and boosted margins on petrol and other refined products.The run-up in commodity prices earlier in 2008 left Chevron with full year revenues of $265bn, up from $214bn in 2007. Its full-year net income was $23.93bn, up 28 per cent from $18.69bn.The company invested $23bn in capital and exploratory projects during the year, while buying back $8bn in stock. Chevron said it would keep its capital and exploratory budget at $23bn this year, even as others announced cutbacks.“We enter 2009 with the financial strength to meet the challenges of a difficult economy,’’ said Dave O’Reilly, Chevron’s chief executive.Despite its massive spending, Chevron’s worldwide oil-equivalent production averaged 2.54m barrels per day in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.61m in the corresponding 2007 period, which it attributed to hurricane damages to production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico last September.
476;COP;Conocophillips;2009-01-30T12:46:45Z;Oil refinery strike spreads;;"Strikes and protests have been staged by workers at several British refineries and power plants on Friday in the widening dispute over the hiring of foreign workers for a refinery construction project on the east coast of England.Total’s Lindsey oil refinery at Killingholme and the nearby ConocoPhillips refinery at Humber, both in Lincolnshire, the Ineos refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland and the Petroplus refinery on Teesside were all hit by walk-outs.Contractors at other sites in Scotland, including two power stations, a gas plant and a chemical plant, took part in demonstrations, union officials said.There were no signs of any disruption to fuel supplies.The dispute is over Total’s use of an Italian contractor to build a £200m unit at its Lindesy plant.Irem, the contractor, has brought in its own workers from Italy and Portugal, who are sleeping in accommodation barges, rather than hiring local staff.The protests reflect mounting tensions over employment, as the number of people out of work and claiming benefits in the UK rises towards 2m.Union leaders denied that workers were taking action because the company had employed foreign labour, saying that the protests had been sparked by its refusal to consider hiring UK staff.Derek Simpson, general secretary of Unite, the country’s biggest union, told BBC radio: ”What’s happening at the Lindsey oil refinery is the same situation that’s occurring in two or three or even more construction sites across Britain.”It’s not the question of foreign workers. It is the question that some of these companies…are saying they will exclusively debar UK workers; they will not consider UK workers under any circumstances.”Mr. Simpson also said in a press statment issued later on Friday that Unite’s national executive, the governing body of the union, had called for a national protest in Westminster and that Unite was consulting its lawyers on the potential illegality of some employers’ practices in the engineering and construction industries.A Unite official had earlier confirmed that the walk-outs were “unofficial action” and that the union could therefore not condone them.Privately, however, union officials said that they understood the British workers’ frustration.One said: “This is not about excluding migrant workers, but making sure there is a level playing field and that British workers get the same opportunities for jobs.”Total told the BBC that Irem, which employs a specialist workforce, had won the contract to construct the new HDS-3 unit at the Lindsey plant, after a ”fair” tendering process."
477;COP;Conocophillips;2009-01-28T23:19:36Z;Oil falls push ConocoPhillips $32bn into red;;ConocoPhillips said on Wednesday that it had swung to a huge quarterly loss after taking a $34bn writedown as falling oil and gas prices continue to take their toll on asset prices.The US’s third-largest oil group had warned of the writedown, as well as 1,300 staff lay-offs and a reduction in capital spending this year to $12.5bn, from $15.3bn in 2008, in an interim report several weeks ago.However, the fourth-quarter net loss of $31.8bn, compared with a $4.4bn profit in the year-ago period, prompted analysts on Wednesday to question how the company would cope if energy prices continued to fall.The oil price peaked at $147 a barrel last July but has fallen dramatically since then, trading on Wednesday at $44.63. Natural gas has fallen from $13.50 per million British thermal unit in July to $4.47 on Wednesday.“The company has a potentially tough task ahead of it persuading investors that it is well equipped to weather $45 oil and $5 natural gas prices,” said Mark Flannery, Credit Suisse global energy analyst. “Persistently weak natural gas prices in particular will cut further into earnings this year. In addition, lower capital expenditures will damage upstream volume growth.”Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, sought to comfort investors, explaining that the cutbacks were to reduce costs and limit capital spending to “live within our means”.“We are planning for a prolonged and difficult business environment,” said Mr Mulva. “[However], through organic growth and prior business transactions, we have the resources and opportunities for long-term growth.”Conoco’s share price had risen 1.5 per cent to $50.24 by midday in New York on Wednesday.Excluding the writedowns Conoco’s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings were $1.9bn, or $1.28 per share, down from $4.1bn, or $2.55 per share, a year earlier. Its revenues were $44.5bn, down from $52.7bn a year ago.
478;COP;Conocophillips;2009-01-28T16:40:13Z;ConocoPhillips swings to fourth-quarter loss;;ConocoPhillips’s 2008 fourth-quarter net loss of $31.8bn prompted analysts on Wednesday to question how the US’s third-largest oil company will cope this year with the plunge in oil and natural gas prices.Conoco swung to a loss, from net income of $4.4bn in the year-earlier quarter, on plunging commodity prices and a massive $34bn write-down on the ensuing reduction in its asset values.“The company has a potentially tough task ahead of it persuading investors that it is well equipped to weather $45 oil and $5 natural gas prices,’’ said Mark Flannery, Credit Suisse Global Energy analyst.Conoco had warned of the write-down, 1,300 in layoffs and a reduction in capital spending this year to $12.5bn, from $15.3bn in 2008, in an interim report that prepared the market for the poor results.Conoco was the first of the major oil companies to report fourth-quarter results and set the tone for grim results from Royal Dutch Shell on Thursday, ExxonMobil and Chevron on Friday and BP next week.After Conoco’s fourth-quarter results, Mr Flannery said there will be questions over the company’s 2009 performance if oil and natural gas prices do not improve.“Persistently weak natural gas prices, in particular, will cut further into earnings this year,’’ Mr Flannery said. “In addition, lower capital expenditures will damage upstream volume growth.’’Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, sought to comfort investors, explaining the cutbacks were to reduce costs and limit capital spending to ``live within our means.’’ Nonetheless, he added Conoco has a portfolio of high-quality assets that enables it to replace reserves and maintain current production levels.“Through organic growth and prior business transactions, we have the resources and opportunities for long-term growth,’’ Mr Mulva said.Conoco’s share price rose 0.99 per cent to $50 at midday on Wednesday.Excluding the write-downs, Conoco’s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings were $1.9bn, or $1.28 per share, down from $4.1bn, or $2.55 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Its revenues were $44.5bn, down from $52.7bn a year ago.While some analysts objected to the rush to layoffs at the downturn in the market, noting the long-term trend of rising energy demand in a tight skilled labour market, others noted nobody knew how long the economic slowdown, credit crisis and low commodity prices would stretch.
479;COP;Conocophillips;2009-01-25T23:37:09Z;National groups bear brunt of change;;Little more than a year ago PetroChina, the oil company largely owned by the Chinese government, surpassed ExxonMobil to become the world’s biggest listed energy group. It was the first time in oil’s history that a national oil company had boasted the industry’s largest market capitalisation.Months later, Alexei Miller, chief executive of Gazprom, confidently asserted that within a decade the Kremlin-controlled gas monopoly he headed would be the world’s largest energy company with a market capitalisation of more than $1,000bn.What a difference a credit crisis makes. By the end of 2008, after oil prices had fallen dramatically, ExxonMobil again found itself on the top rung as international oil companies started to see opportunities that had not existed a year ago.Every international energy group in the top 10 of a study to be published on Monday by PFC Energy, the Washington-based consulting group – ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, BP, and Total – gained in ranking.In contrast, PetroChina, Petrobras, Gazprom and Sinopec all tumbled, with the last two companies slipping out of the top 10 altogether.Their swift change in fortune increases the risk that some of the world’s biggest oil and gas projects will be delayed as technological requirements mount and funding becomes more difficult and expensive to secure.This leaves some national oil companies’ customers worrying there will be too little oil and gas available in the middle of the next decade.Gazprom controls 25 per cent of the world’s gas reserves. This includes the frigid and remote Yamal peninsula and the giant Shtokman field, arguably the world’s most promising new frontier, which the company insists it can develop without significant foreign help.But Gazprom’s debt burden and the far higher cost of credit could delay necessary investments, analysts said.All this means Europe, Russia’s biggest customer, will have to brace itself for gas shortages far more entrenched than gaps caused by the pricing dispute between Gazprom and Ukraine, analysts and European diplomats warn.Oswald Clint, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said possible two-year delays at Yamal were material enough to “tip the supply/demand dynamics across Russia and more importantly Europe firmly into a deficit position”.He argues that credit crisis or not, Gazprom, faces such steep production declines at its older fields that it will struggle to grow at all in the next eight yearsMeanwhile, on the other side of the globe, Petrobras recently discovered the world’s most promising new oil deposits under thick layers of salt in the deep waters off its south-eastern coast.After months of delays, Petrobras last week came out with its strategic review that paints an optimistic picture of the company's ability to tap its riches.But some oil company executives are less sure and note that much will depend on the legal framework still being debated that will govern the field’s development.Further exacerbating the issue is the downturn in the oil services sector. Shares of Schlumberger, the world’s biggest oil services company, have fallen 57 per cent.Such a dramatic reversal in fortunes brings with it the potential of new opportunities for the relatively robust international oil companies.Until recently, oil-rich countries aggressively rewrote their contracts with international oil companies ending their majority ownership, squeezing them out of leadership positions, reducing their profit share and denying them new opportunities.The countries turned instead to national oil companies and oil services groups, leaving international oil companies struggling to expand their production.In Libya, that attitude appears not to have changed, with Muammer Gaddafi last week raising the possibility of nationalising the country's oil sector.But other countries, including Venezuela, once the most aggressive oil-rich nation, have begun to approach international oil company executives for new deals.Ironically, the success of national energy groups, such as Gazprom and Petrobras, lie largely in how quickly they realise the tide has turned against them. Whether the world has enough oil and gas to fuel its economic recovery could rest on their willingness to embrace technology and foreign expertise.
480;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Electricity: Carbon capture at core of plans for fossil fuels;;The aim of producing clean electricity in no way lacks public support from politicians and chief executives. After years of inaction, governments around the world are signing up to ambitious targets for raising the amount of energy coming from renewable sources and cutting carbon emissions, with the aim of slowing climate change.But the question is how many of these targets will actually be met, and whether the current economic slowdown will hamper investment in cleaner forms of electricity generation.After all, burning coal to produce electricity – which creates more CO2 than any other method of power generation – is still the cheapest and most reliable option for most countries.Burning natural gas is somewhat cleaner than coal, but as reserves of gas are more thinly distributed, a worldwide “dash for gas” looks unlikely.Although the rapid growth of emerging economies such as China and India is now slowing, these regions will still need more generation capacity in the future and are unlikely to abandon coal. If climate change is to be reduced, however, they will have to embrace the idea of carbon capture and storage (CCS), which prevents the emissions from burning fossil fuels entering the atmosphere, and also invest in truly clean forms of power, such as wind, wave and solar.Nuclear is another form of energy promoted as “clean”. But the obvious problem is the hazardous radioactive waste produced as a by-product. Although scientists have credible solutions for how this waste can be safely stored and disposed of, the cost is likely to be enormous. And deciding where to site respositories for nuclear waste is controversial.Many politicians and energy executives say that, to make a real dent in emissions, countries will have to invest in renewables, nuclear and carbon capture and storage projects, and that they should not be seen as rival causes.Nevertheless, at a time when funds are harder to come by, it is common to hear the nuclear and fossil fuel industries undermining renewable energy, and for environmental campaigners to oppose “low carbon” energy such as nuclear and carbon capture for fear it would jeopardise wind and wave projects.The issue of CCS is one of the most contentious in the electricity industry. Enthusiasts argue that, if the technology is proven to work on a commercial scale, it will provide a way of halting climate change while allowing countries to keep burning fossil fuels in the medium-term. But opponents say that pinning hopes on CCS lets energy companies off when it comes to investing in renewable energy.Mike Farley, director of technology policy liaison at Doosan Babcock, which supplies CCS technology, says more investment in renewables will require more investment in conventional plants as back-up when weather conditions reduce the output of wind and solar projects.He argues that coal- and gas-fired plants are better-suited to this than nuclear reactors. “Nuclear doesn’t flex, it stays at a constant output. When output from renewables goes up and down, nuclear can’t compensate in the way that fossil fuels can.”CCS is being pursued in Europe, North America and Australia, but has yet to gain much traction in emerging markets. Last year, the European Union passed directives on CCS, providing a framework for the regulation of the fledgling industry and outlining financial incentives to encourage projects. The aim is for between 10 and 12 CCS demonstration plants across Europe.The UK government is offering funding for the country’s first CCS demonstration project, with Eon, Scottish Power and a joint venture of RWE Npower and Peel Holdings competing for the cash. The government has stipulated that it will only fund a post-combustion CCS project, as it thinks this technology will have the widest international application. But other companies that have been promoting pre-combustion CCS projects, such as Centrica, Powerfuel and ConocoPhillips, may find that they are eligible for EU funding.Mr Farley at Doosan Babcock says a consensus is forming among UK politicians that CCS will be one of the three main technologies – along with renewables and nuclear – needed to achieve “decarbonised electricity”. He says: “What is emerging is the view that more needs to be done, and sooner.”He says that a big leap forward would be for the UK government to give consent only to new fossil fuel power plants that are “carbon capture-ready” – that is, suitable to have CCS technology fitted in the future.“We need to recognise that CCS is going to be necessary and also be realistic that lots of power plants are going to be built before they can be fitted with CCS. So a good example to set would be to mandate that all new coal or gas plants should be carbon capture-ready.”
481;COP;Conocophillips;2009-01-15T20:10:11Z;Venezuelan oil;;"Oilmen are extraordinarily quick to forgive and forget, given the fickle nature of petro-states, but even their memories are not this short. It was just two years ago that Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s president, informed some of the world’s largest producers that their multibillion dollar investments in the promising but technically-daunting Orinoco Belt would become state property. With crude $110 a barrel lower than it was in July, his position has understandably softened, but so has the risk appetite of the world’s oil majors.Indeed, the shoe is suddenly on the other foot for Mr Chávez, who is learning that agreements made in good times may be reinterpreted in bad ones. Knowing that national oil firm Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) lacked capital, various memoranda were signed with friendly state energy companies in Russia, Iran and China in 2007 and 2008.Now things have changed and he is reportedly seeking private partners. But neither state-owned nor private producers would commit to a capital-intensive heavy oil project at current prices, whether in reliable Canada or less-reliable Venezuela. This is a problem, as heavy social spending on the “Bolivarian Revolution” has sapped PDVSA’s resources and crimped output. Venezuela needs its crude basket to average around $60 to balance its budget this year, but it fetches about half that today.Further development of Orinoco will have to wait for wounds to heal too. Companies such as ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil that took a risk there when oil prices crashed a decade ago are still seeking compensation for expropriated fields. Smaller companies may tackle less-challenging projects but these will do little to bolster Venezuela’s oil revenue, which made up 93 per cent of exports last year. Venezuela’s reserve potential is so massive that the majors will surely swallow their pride and return one day. That will probably be too late to avert some tough choices in Caracas though.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

482;COP;Conocophillips;2008-12-08T16:34:43Z;Oil and gas: Gamble on gigantic LNG project is set to come good;;In the late 1990s, the newly-installed emir of Qatar took a risk. Despite being a big oil producer and member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the emirate was broke.But rather than hide its head in the sand, Qatar solicited ratings from international agencies – unusual for an Arab country – and issued bonds to finance big schemes to extract gas from the North Field, the world’s largest reserve of non-associated gas, that is gas which is not part of an oil-bearing field.Western bankers were not deterred by Qatar’s reserves being inside the Straits of Hormuz and shared with Iran, which calls the field South Pars.A decade on, and Qatar has commissioned the largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) production system in the world – first cargoes from the facility are due to be despatched imminently – and is about to commission the biggest gas-to-liquids plant.The expense has been sizeable. Gas-to-liquids technology produces cleaner burning fuel and is, therefore, a popular choice in more environmentally conscious times, but it is complex and expensive.Royal Dutch Shell is building the 140,000b/d Pearl GTL complex at a cost of more than $18bn.The fact that the gas is non-associated means transport infrastructure had to be installed from scratch at even greater cost. LNG has to be cooled into liquid form in so-called trains before it can be shipped.Qatar has split its LNG industry into two operating companies – Qatargas and Rasgas. The latter is a series of joint ventures in which ExxonMobil holds 25-30 per cent and state-owned Qatar Petroleum has 65-70 per cent along with mainly Asian investors. The company is on schedule to complete its sixth train early next year, with a seventh coming on line at the end of 2009.Qatargas is a series of joint ventures between Qatar Petroleum and big oil companies, including Shell, ConocoPhillips, Total and ExxonMobil. Qatargas’s fourth LNG train started in July, delayed from the scheduled start the previous winter. Qatargas is developing four so-called mega-trains, each of which can produce more than 7m tonnes a year. The target for Qatar as a whole is 77m tonnes, up from about 31m tonnes at present.Industry observers are focused on a reservoir evaluation study of the North Field where the authorities have declared a moratorium on further development. The government has previously said it wants to develop the reserves in such a way that they last 100 years.Youssef Kamal, the finance minister, says visitors to Doha frequently ask if the moratorium is likely to be broken. “We have committed ourselves to 77m tonnes. We are not committing ourselves to any extra while there is a lot of demand,” Mr Kamal says.Andrew Pearson of Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based consultants, says that current LNG projects may be the last. Most estimates put the North Field reserves at 900,000bn cu ft of gas – although higher figures are proffered. Mr Pearson says if all the projects under the moratorium are completed, then Qatar will be producing about 23bn cu ft daily.“If you do the maths on that production for a 100-year period, that gets you close to your 900 trillion cubic feet,” he says. “Our view is that it is unlikely there will be further large-scale LNG developments from Qatar.”Wood Mackenzie sees the only room for further large-scale expansion coming from gas that was allocated to a gas-to-liquids project cancelled last year as costs spiralled. That project was sanctioned before the moratorium.As attention has focused on the enormous gas reserves, oil production has been ticking along nicely. Despite recent sharp falls in prices as demand has plummeted amid the gloomy economic outlook, economists say prices for Qatari oil are likely to average $100 a barrel over the year.The credit crunch may even yield benefits to the emirate. Qatar, and other hydrocarbon-rich states, have suffered a dearth of skilled engineers who have been able to name their price as oil has soared and previously uneconomic projects became feasible.Mr Kamal says oil production this year is approaching 900,000b/d and is a bigger earner than gas. That situation is likely to change in two years’ time, he says. Next year, production should exceed 1m b/d.
483;COP;Conocophillips;2008-12-08T09:25:53Z;Lukoil/Repsol;;"Lukoil’s interest in Repsol has whipped up even more of a furore in Spain than Gazprom’s 2006 suggestion that it fancied buying Centrica did in the UK. The reaction in Madrid, where Spanish media reported on Friday that the Russian oil group was still seeking government approval to buy 20 per cent of Repsol, is overblown. Lukoil is privately owned; ConocoPhillips of the US owns 20 per cent. Unlike Gazprom, it is Kremlin-loyal, not Kremlin-controlled. The Russian leadership has, admittedly, pushed Russian companies to make acquisitions abroad to underscore Russia’s economic revival. But Lukoil’s Spanish ambitions probably derive in part from the same calculation that has underlain many companies’ foreign expansion since the Yukos affair: that owning high-profile assets internationally is insurance against Kremlin assault.Yet, if Spain’s politicians are hardly enthused about a Lukoil-Repsol deal, the Russian group’s shareholders should be less so. True, a presence on Repsol’s board might help its aim of expanding European refining capacity, enabling it to send Russian crude to Spanish refineries. But, as UBS notes, a minority stake seems unlikely to assist another Lukoil goal – of expanding into Latin American production – since many of Repsol’s activities in that region are separate joint ventures. Raising its stake later could still prove politically difficult. And the prices being mooted are up to twice Repsol’s current share price – valuing the Spanish group at well above Lukoil’s own market capitalisation. It is hard to see how such a deal could create value for Lukoil shareholders.Meanwhile, Urals blend crude finished last week at below $40 a barrel, a level at which Lukoil is likely to have to cut capital spending in Russia sharply next year. This is not the time to pursue trophy assets abroad (its Repsol pursuit is part of a spending spree ranging from an oil refinery in Sicily to filling stations across central Europe). Better to focus on improving management in Russia and ensuring it can fund development of its extensive reserves at home.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

484;COP;Conocophillips;2008-12-04T22:55:24Z;Nippon Oil/Nippon Mining;;"Recessions have a way of throwing up national champions, sometimes by default, sometimes by design. The agreed merger of Nippon Oil, Japan’s largest integrated oil company, with its smaller rival, Nippon Mining – which, despite the name, is three-quarters oil by revenues – is being sold as an attempt to create a Japanese rival to the majors. Both partners on Thursday sketched out visions of “aggressive” global growth, bolstered by pooled cash balances. The reality will be more prosaic.By size alone, the new group will be up there. Last year’s combined sales of about $130bn put it in the same league as Eni, and not a million miles from Total and ConocoPhillips. But the similarities end there. Specifically, the merged group would lack a cutting-edge exploration and production arm – the calling-card of any major that wants to compete for access to somebody else’s resources. E&P is just over 3 per cent of revenues at Nippon Oil, and tiny at Mining. Neither has the technological clout of Inpex, which tends to be Japan’s sole representative among international drilling consortia.The new group must shrink its core refining operations before anything else. For years, Japanese refiners have suffered narrowing margins thanks to chronic overcapacity. In spite of the odd shuttering and tactical divestment here and there, supply still far outstrips demand, which is fading by the day.Braced for full-year losses from both companies, investors were anxious for news of shutdowns. Both share prices leapt by double digits as executives promised to remove just over a fifth of combined crude refining capacity within two years. But the painstaking deal timetable – four months to come up with a management team and a merger ratio – indicates the daunting transformation ahead.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

485;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Price falls prompt caution over US natural gas;;Falling commodity prices are leading the world’s biggest oil companies to ease their rush into US natural gas supplies.Chevron, the second biggest US oil company, said it would hold back plans to expand production in Colorado’s Piceance basin.It began an ambitious $7.3bn project there in August aimed at developing a field of 3,000bn cu ft of gas over 30,000 acres in the next 15 to 20 years.Gary Luquette, president of Chevron North America Exploration and Production Company, said: “In 2004, Chevron’s capital expenditures in North America were $1.9bn. This year, we will spend $6bn. There’s certainly no shortage of growth opportunities in North America right now and the Piceance Basin is one of the areas that we expect to provide production growth.”However, the drop in commodity prices had led Chevron to maintain two rigs in the basin instead of moving to six as planned.Nonetheless, no company wants to abandon positions in the US, given the deterioration of growth prospects for global oil. Indeed, the majors’ rush for US natural gas supplies has set the stage for a second year of record production growth.Last year, US natural gas production grew 4.3 per cent – more than any country in the world.ConocoPhillips’ annual natural gas production in 2003 averaged 3,522m cu ft and increased to an average of 5,087m cu ft for 2007, when it was the leading gas producer in continental US.Jim Mulva, Conoco chief executive, said it would have to scale down its capital programme, given market conditions but not at the cost of losing its foothold in US natural gas. “We don’t want to lose the optionality of drilling the wells.”The big companies are eager for new sources of reserves as the world’s oil-rich nations, from Russia to Venezuela, have gained the expertise and capital to tap conventional oil and gas resources, sidelining the majors.Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, said this had forced the majors into extracting unconventional sources of natural gas, including shale gas, tight sands and coal-bed methane. “The opportunity is there, so they have to take it.”The recent drop in oil prices may have taken the short-term pressure off finding alternatives to oil, but the International Energy Agency has warned that 30m barrels per day of new global crude oil capacity is needed by 2015 or the world runs the risk of a “supply crunch” that could impede economic recovery.This has kept the pressure on developing natural gas. These sources are more technically challenging and capital-intensive than conventional oil, so the majors are building natural gas into a niche area of expertise.The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association of the US oil and natural gas industry, said this year’s exploration and production drilling activity outpaced last year’s and is nearly twice the level seen in the 1990s.An estimated 16,379 oil wells, natural gas wells and dry holes were completed in the third quarter, up 16 per cent from the year-ago quarter.Of those, 6,244 were oil wells and 8,467 natural gas wells.ExxonMobil, the west’s biggest oil company, is among those pressing ahead.Mark Albers, Exxon’s senior vice-president, said: “Across the US, we are increasing activity in onshore gas plays driven by drilling in the Rockies, the Arkoma, East Texas and the South Texas Basins”.
486;COP;Conocophillips;2008-11-02T18:22:21Z;Kashagan partners end dispute;;Kazakhstan has claimed victory after resolving a lengthy dispute with a foreign oil group led by Italy’s Eni about production delays and ballooning costs at the Kashagan field, which had threatened to derail the world’s biggest oil development.A deal finalised last Friday allows KazMunaigas, Kazakhstan’s state oil company, to double its equity stake and receive a larger share of the field’s eventual 1.6m barrels a day production, when world oil prices are high.Maksat Idenov, the first vice-president of KazMunaigas, said: “This is a victory. We have won equal treatment and a fair deal to ensure the sustainability of the project for years to come.”The settlement, after 15-months of arduous negotiations, comes as a relief to group participants, including Eni, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, ConocoPhillips and Japan’s Inpex, which have already invested $12bn at Kashagan, the most complex oil project ever undertaken.Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Eni, said that the deal was “fair.”“We have reached a positive equilibrium today. I hope it will last a long time,” he told the Financial Times.Foreign partners have diluted their shares in Kashagan, enabling KazMunaigas to increase its stake to 16.81 per cent, equivalent to that of the largest members of the consortium. KMG will pay $1.78bn for the additional equity after production begins.A new payment mechanism linked to world oil prices will allow Kazakhstan to receive up to 12.5 per cent of Kashagan’s oil production even before the consortium recovers its costs at the field. Eni will continue to lead the first phase of Kashagan’s development. But a committee, staffed by representatives from all companies in the group, will operate two later phases.Mr Idenov said that the new management structure would “improve efficiency and transparency” at Kashagan.Under a new system carving up responsibility for the project between partners, ExxonMobil will manage the drilling of Kashagan where oil, containing large amounts of toxic sulphur, lies under huge pressure in waters that freeze in winter.Shell will oversee offshore construction and Eni onshore construction while Total takes responsibility for co-ordinating oil transport.Production at Kashagan, originally expected to begin in 2005, has been repeatedly delayed and is now set to start in October 2013.Kazakhstan has warned that the consortium will face heavy penalties if there are further delays.Mr Scaroni said Kashagan might begin producing before the new deadline.
487;COP;Conocophillips;2008-10-31T15:22:06Z;The dawn of a disturbing new reality;;In the past month, the world has witnessed one of the largest financial and economic upheavals in a generation. The fallout may have been most immediately felt on Wall Street, but the effect on energy, and perhaps even the environment, will also be profound.Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of Total, the French oil company, who usually argues for governments to get out of the way of those trying to bring enough energy to the market to satisfy demand, this week said recent events meant lawmakers needed to consider extending a helping hand to environmentally friendly energy sources and technologies made uneconomical by falling oil prices.Executives say environmental initiatives such as carbon capture and storage must not be abandoned and oilfields need to be developed in an as environmentally friendly way as possible. But Chevron has already warned that Australia’s cap and trade initiative could make the development of the Gorgon gas field uneconomical.Royal Dutch Shell has dropped its proposed investment in plans to build the world’s biggest offshore wind farm, the London Array, to concentrate on less risky US onshore wind power.On the government side, the trend could be similar, as environmentalists worry that the billions being spent on bailing out banks may not leave much for the environment. Indeed, amid the fiercely contested US presidential election, the credit crunch has firmly overtaken energy security as issue number one, at least in terms of rhetoric.But Mr De Margerie’s main message centred on security of supply, rather than the environment. He and other executives contend that the drop in oil prices will make it more difficult to develop enough energy to meet the future demand of countries, such as China and India, and could prolong the downturn.The Opec oil cartel made that same point in its communiqué last week, in the hope of justifying its decision to cut production by as much as 1.8m barrels a day. “Oil prices have witnessed a dramatic collapse – unprecedented in speed and magnitude – with these falling to levels which may put at jeopardy many existing oil projects and lead to the cancellation or delay of others, possibly resulting in a medium-term supply shortage.”Projects in high-cost areas, such as Canada’s oil sands and in the deep waters of west Africa, are already being delayed, while the development of giant fields such as Russia’s Shtokman gasfield have become more tenuous, as Gazprom, the monopoly, struggles under the credit squeeze.In fact, the International Energy Agency, the developed countries’ watchdog, does not see Russia, the world’s second largest oil exporter, being able to increase its production at all in a draft of the Paris-based agency’s latest forecast to 2030.Many of Russia’s biggest oil fields are ageing and declining, and tax cuts meant to give companies incentives to develop new fields and help boost the production of old ones are too little, too late, executives and analysts say.But the problem is far from limited to Russia.In fact, the IEA believes the single most important factor in deciding how hard the energy industry will have to work to meet demand is the rate at which ageing oil fields are declining.Preliminary results of a study of the world’s largest oilfields, due to be published by the IEA next month, indicate that the scale of the challenge is great.The world will need to invest $360bn a year in boosting oil production to meet demand, initial data in an early draft of the report obtained by the FT, states. Much of that money will need to be spent in countries where oil reserves are controlled by national oil companies that are either too badly managed or technically incapable of making the necessary investments.Worldwide, oilfields are declining at an annual natural rate of 9.1 per cent and, even with investment to boost production, are still declining at 6.4 per cent, the IEA’s draft report states.Making the kinds of investments to arrest decline is more difficult when prices are low. Oil companies often choose to shut down a field, rather than pour more money in for little gain. It is a reality that could be felt in the North Sea, where years of high oil prices have prompted a flotilla of niche companies to sail in to save small oilfields.In fact, many of those small oil companies are now struggling as their share prices have dropped and, in some cases, the credit crunch has eaten into their ability to fund production programmes.This new reality is one of the other leading forces that have emerged to change the industry, as credit has become tight and oil prices have fallen.Ian Taylor, head of Vitol, the energy trader, says he believes the industry stands at the edge of a wave of consolidation. “This is the best opportunity for 15-20 years. Many companies are trading at below the value of their assets,” he says.Indeed, on the day he was speaking, BG announced a deal to acquire Queensland Gas for A$5.6bn ($3.8bn). The bid was at an 80 per cent premium to the previous QGC share price, but still valued the Australian company’s gas reserves at less than half the implied value paid by ConocoPhillips of the US for similar assets over the summer.The pickings are richest for the biggest companies by market capitalisation. Their shares have for years traded at relatively low earning multiples despite record revenues, as their inability to grow by finding new fields or taking over large companies has let them down.These companies are now sitting on unspent cash ($40bn in the case of ExxonMobil, the largest of the group) and very low debt.As Tony Hayward, chief executive of BP, put it: “We think the current turmoil may create opportunities for us and we will look at those very closely.”Total is said to be eyeing Nexen, a Canadian oil company, whose shares have fallen more than 50 per cent in the past six months, meaning it is no longer too expensive to buy.Executives from other big oil companies, meanwhile, say they are looking at US players, such as Anadarko.BG, whose liquefied natural gas portfolio had for years made it attractive to the majors, but which was too big and expensive to be bought, is now again on radar screens, executives say.Maurice Berns of the Boston Consulting Group, says: “In previous downturns, what have we seen the successful companies do? They consolidate and build competitive strength to come out in a better position when the dust has settled.”But the future will not lie in the hands of those companies. Instead, it will be the investment decisions of national oil companies, many of which are in Opec countries, that will decide whether there is enough oil to see the world out of economic turmoil. And it will be up to governments to ensure the environment is considered in times of economic sickness, as well as in times of economic health.So far, the signs that either will be able to act in the world’s best interest are growing weaker – with the fall in the oil price and the onset of recession – rather than stronger.
488;COP;Conocophillips;2008-10-28T08:03:38Z;BG agrees A$5.6bn Australian gas deal;;Shares in Queensland Gas Company surged 80 per cent on Tuesday after the UK’s BG Group launched a recommended cash takeover offer valuing the Australian resources group at A$5.6bn.The bid underlines the UK group’s determination to secure a lead role in the development of Australia’s coal bed methane gas assets which BG plans to convert into liquefied natural gas to service exports markets in Asia.By the close of trading in Australia, BG estimated it had secured 57 per cent of its target, a figure that included its existing stake, shares acquired in the market, and holdings from investors that have agreed to back the offer.The deal comes six weeks after BG abandoned its A$13.8bn takeover offer for Origin Energy, another Australian group developing coal bed methane gas assets.BG was rejected by Origin’s board at the 11th hour with the Australian group subsequently agreeing a joint venture with ConocoPhillips, the US oil group, in return for A$9.6bn.Ashley Almanza, BG’s chief financial officer who has been in Australia negotiating the deal, said QGC was a good strategic fit.“This transaction enhances our global gas strategy, building on our existing Australian domestic and export interests and will provide the group with both Asia-Pacific resources and Pacific basin LNG supply,” Mr Almanza said.Analysts said BG was paying a full price for QGC’s assets, adding it was prepared to overlook the turmoil in global financial markets.”It’s a reflection of BG wanting to get into that Queensland LNG space and they’re prepared to pay big dollars for it,” Peter Arden, an analyst at Ord Minnett, told local media. “They’re not reneging on that thrust just because the markets have melted down.”The BG is pitched at A$5.75 a share, the same level as QGC’s closing price on Tuesday, up from the A$3.20 at which the shares were suspended last Friday.BG said it had received advice from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board that there were no objections to the takeover. It will fund the purchase from cash and existing credit facilities.The British group already owns 9.9 per cent of QGC and has agreed to acquire shares from QGC’s directors, including Richard Cottee, and institutional shareholders. Mr Cottee said the BG deal delivered certainty to QGC shareholders during a risky climate.AGL Energy, another Australian listed group, has agreed to sell its 24.9 per cent stake to BG in the absence of a superior offer.Australia’s fledgling coal bed methane gas industry has also attracted interest from Royal Dutch Shell and Petronas of Malaysia.
489;COP;Conocophillips;2008-10-26T18:45:09Z;BG Group nearing Australia gas deal;;BG Group, the British oil and gas company, is in late-stage talks to secure a 24.9 per cent stake in Queensland Gas Company in a deal that would trigger a mandatory takeover bid valuing the Australian coal-bed methane gas group at close to A$5bn (£1.96bn).BG’s move on QGC, a company with which it is already in partnership, comes six weeks after it abandoned its A$13.8bn offer for Origin Energy after that Australian group struck a 50/50 venture to develop its coal-bed methane assets with ConocoPhillips of the US in return for A$9.6bn.The British group’s failure to secure Origin after months of talks was a setback to BG’s strategy of building production of liquefied natural gas in the Pacific to serve Asian customers. BG’s latest endeavour underlines its desire to play a lead role in the development of the fledgling coal-bed methane industry in eastern Australia, which has also attracted interest from Royal Dutch Shell and Petronas of Malaysia.Richard Griffith, of Evolution Securities, wrote that if BG managed to secure control of QGC for around the reported price, it would prove it was right to walk away from the “overpriced” bid for Origin.“QGC offers almost the same reserves potential but at a fraction of the price,” he said. The Origin bid had led to concern about the strain on BG’s finances had it been successful, but Mr Griffith said the more modest £2bn cost of QGC would be “well within BG’s gearing capacity”.The 24.9 per cent stake BG wants to buy is owned by AGL Energy, whose shares are in a trading halt pending a “possible material transaction”. QGC is also in a trading halt for the same reason, with both companies indicating an announcement is imminent.QGC shares were suspended at A$3.20. However, reports in Australia said BG could pay A$5.10 or A$5.45 a share to AGL and other shareholders, a 70 per cent premium at the upper end of that range.Barring any last-minute hitches, AGL is expected to agree to sell its stake to BG under the terms of an offer that will be recommended by QGC’s board. None of the companies would comment on Sunday, although people close to the situation said a deal had all but been agreed.A BG takeover of QGC would need the approval of Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board.QGC has been a takeover target for some time and was in the sights of Santos, the Australian oil and gas group. QGC has also acquired a number of smaller rivals in Australia.
490;COP;Conocophillips;2008-10-22T20:44:49Z;Wall St plunges on grim corporate outlook;;A fresh batch of grim earnings pushed US stocks to a new five-year low as concerns grew over the difficulties facing corporate America in the wake of banking sector turmoil.Company results – and, more importantly, their gloomy outlooks – across a wide range of sectors reinforced fears of a global, as well as domestic, recession. Energy and materials, down 10.4 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively, led the market slump.Down as much as 8.3 per cent at one point, the S&P 500 closed 6.1 per cent lower at 896.78, below the level reached earlier in the month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.7 per cent to 8,519.21 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost 4.8 per cent to 1,615.75.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – shot up 30.5 per cent to 69.32, which indicated signs of heightened stress. Andrew Wilkinson, market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said that traders had donned “tin helmets” as options for the index expired.AT&T and Boeing slid 7.6 per cent to $23.78 and 7.5 per cent to $42.91, respectively, after both were among several blue chip stocks to disclose worse-than-expected quarterly figures.Pharmaceuticals were hit after Merck also disclosed glum figures and downgraded its outlook. The Dow Component fell 6.5 per cent to $28.01 even after it unveiled plans to axe 12 per cent of its workforce, a move investors would normally welcome.Traditionally defensive stocks such as McDonald’s failed to escape the declines. Shares in the world’s largest restaurant group, which managed an increase in third-quarter profit, held on to gains for much of the day but closed down 1.7 per cent to $54.18. The consumer staples sector slid the least of all, but still finished 3.8 per cent lower.Energy was the biggest drag on the market, hurt by oil’s slide below $70 as well as negative earnings, and slumped 10.4 per cent overall. ConocoPhillips lost 9.1 per cent to $49.06 after the group disappointed with exploration and production forecasts as well as a reluctance to buy back its shares.Baker Hughes, down 22.1 per cent to $30.35, was one of the biggest drags on the S&P after the oilfield services group warned of a “less certain” outlook as energy prices continue to fall.“Markets are being dominated by the fears and nerves that have been dominating for the last few weeks,” said Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC Markets. “Growth is the main fear as earnings season gets into full swing.”Materials were another big laggard, down 8.3 per cent overall, hurt by BHP Billiton’s production figures.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, whose disappointing figures helped push the market sharply lower in the previous session, tumbled another 17.8 per cent to $26.92.All 10 main economic sectors were firmly in the red, although some technology groups managed to find positive territory.Apple added 5.9 per cent to $96.87, after sales of the iPhone powered a surge in quarterly profit. Yahoo advanced 2.7 per cent to $12.39 on plans to cut at least 10 per cent of its staff after quarterly profit fell sharply.Broadcom jumped 6.5 per cent to $14.70 on the back of better-than-expected results from the mobile phone chipmaker. Texas Instruments, under pressure in the previous session, recovered as much as 2.6 per cent but closed down 3.4 per cent at $16.28.SanDisk sank 31.6 per cent to $10.09 after Samsung Electronics dropped its $5.9bn unsolicited bid for the memory card manufacturer.Amazon fell 0.5 per cent to $49.99, having lost as much as 4.6 per cent on concerns that results due after the bell would echo a glum update from Ebay.Financials held up relatively well for much of the session as money market rates for interbank lending eased further, but sold off sharply towards the close, down 7 per cent. Insurers sustained particularly heavy losses.Still, Wells Fargo lost 4.1 per cent to $31.30 after Wachovia posted a $23.9bn third-quarter loss, the biggest of any US lender during the credit crisis. Shares in the bank, being acquired by Wells Fargo, fell 6.2 per cent to $5.71.
491;COP;Conocophillips;2008-10-22T18:47:29Z;Profit fears hit Conoco shares;;"Shares in ConocoPhillips fell sharply on Wednesday on fears over future profits and hints the company may curb its share buyback programme.Its shares were down 7.3 per cent at $50.04 in lunchtime trading.The slide came in spite of another surge in profits, up 40 per cent to $5.2bn, or
$3.39 per share, for the third quarter, ahead of analysts’ estimates.Conoco is the US’s third- biggest oil company and the first of the country’s major oil companies to report earnings.Jim Mulva, chief executive, said it was important for the next US president to know that the earnings of oil companies were going to be “dramatically” less than the levels they have reported this year.The programme of using record profits to boost share repurchases might come to an end, the company warned.Conoco said that through to the end of October it will have bought about $8bn of its shares this year. Yet share buybacks for the rest of the year would depend on “market conditions and capital commitments”.“I understand why they are doing it, but it is kind of perverse logic to not buy back your stock when it is this cheap,” Phil Weiss, oil analyst at Argus Research, told Reuters. In addition, Conoco said it expected exploration expenses to be about $400m in the fourth quarter.In the third quarter, the company generated $7.5bn in cash, enabling it to invest $4bn in exploring for and developing oil and natural gas supplies, enhancing refining capabilities and
fostering emerging technologies.That was in spite of two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which shut much of the production from the US’s largest producing area for more than two weeks.The hurricanes cost it 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in production. Conoco’s daily exploration and production averaged 1.75m barels of oil equivalent in the quarter.Conoco said exploration and production income fell to $3.9bn in the third quarter, from $4bn in the previous quarter on essentially flat production because of lower crude oil and natural gas prices.Analysts are revising down projected earnings from the major oil companies for the fourth quarter.Conoco’s emerging businesses segment, which includes biofuels, produced net income of $35m in the third quarter, up from $3m in the year-earlier quarter.However, the majors have an opportunity to grow reserves through acquisitions. Conoco is in a strong position to buy, after ending the quarter with debt of $22bn and a debt-to-capital ratio of 19 per cent."
492;COP;Conocophillips;2008-10-20T20:00:21Z;Energy groups target young ones;;"It is afternoon at The Children’s Museum of Houston and Angelo is scooping up pink plastic stars to see which of three different shaped cups can hold more.In fact, they all hold the same amount, teaching the nine-year-old about spatial awareness and logic – two of many skills the energy industry is keen to develop in the workforce of tomorrow. The skills are not taught by accident – ExxonMobil is sponsoring the exhibit.Oil and gas companies used to secure staff by offering college internships. But the industry faces the loss of 50 per cent of its most experienced workers within the next 10 years, and competition for the dwindling pool of qualified personnel has intensified. Companies have turned first to high schools and then to places like the museum to spark an interest in even younger children.ExxonMobil’s exhibit is called Magnificent Math Moments. El Paso, a natural gas pipeline and exploration and production company, is funding “How does it work?” hands-on displays. ConocoPhillips is sponsoring Earth Sciences Week. The list goes on.Future geologists could get their first exposure to rocks in an exhibit where children weigh and identify minerals. Tomorrow’s engineers might discover a love for building in the inventors’ workshop of Lego kits. Refinery designers might learn about geometry and spatial reasoning doing a toothpick puzzle.“What I’m hearing from oil companies is that they want the different exhibits that develop the engineers,’’ says Priscilla Larson, the museum’s director of development.Companies recognise that the children visiting the museum will be too young to make up the projected shortfall. But staffing constraints will only get worse if they do not find a way to interest these children, experts say.“Math and science are critically important to our company,’’ says Truman Bell, of the ExxonMobil Foundation, which has donated more than $800,000 (£467,000, €601,000) to the museum as part of a broad effort to improve maths and science education in the US. But encouraging children to take an interest in the oil and gas industry can be an uphill struggle. Many young people are suspicious of fossil fuels, seeing them as polluting technologies that have already peaked.Mike Krenek, director at Deloitte Services, the consultant, knows from his own children that students “do not see the oil companies at the forefront of excitement and social consciousness’’.“Trying to change the mindsets is key,’’ he says.Monte King, manager of Shell’s workforce development initiative, says their goal is to convince students that the energy industry is a high-tech, rather than “dinosaur” industry. Given increasing difficulties accessing conventional fuels and calls for more environmentally friendly sources of energy, he says, the industry is at the forefront of researching technological breakthroughs. “This is the challenge of our decade.’’So the companies are not stopping with the children’s museum. El Paso has funded a robotics lab at the KIPP charter school for low-income students in Houston, where it sponsors high-school interns and a senior year work/study programme.Doug Foshee, El Paso’s chief executive, says the talent shortage is “urgent” and believes inviting in underprivileged high-school students as interns or part-time workers is key.“They learn what it is like to be in a professional atmosphere,” he says. “They learn what it would be like to go to college.’’Eric Guerra, 16, has done two El Paso internships and was most impressed that the company took his input seriously: “El Paso tells us we’re El Paso’s future generation.’’Danielle Malone, 24, became an El Paso accountant years after joining KIPP in the fifth grade. “That’s when my foundation was laid,” she says.Houston hopes laying such foundations will enable it to keep its position as energy capital of the world and is hosting three academies to train students for the industry.The 100 students at Charles Milby High School’s Academy of Petroleum E&P Technology go on field trips to companies such as Halliburton; study everything from geology to environmental systems; and are motivated weekly by industry guest speakers.For Milby student Beverly Biggs, 16, the expected dearth of staff is, if anything, an incentive.“I’m going to make a lot of money,” she says, “because everybody is going to leave.’’"
493;COP;Conocophillips;2008-10-15T09:38:36Z;Origin forecasts bumper rise in earnings;;Origin Energy, the Australian group that repelled an A$13.8bn takeover bid from the UK’s BG Group before agreeing a lucrative joint venture with US oil group ConocoPhillips, has forecast a bumper rise in current year earnings of as much as 40 per cent.The energy retailer that is developing its Queensland-based coal bed methane gas assets said the uplift was based on “current market conditions for oil prices, exchange rates and interest rates” together with expected timing of payments from ConocoPhillips proposed A$9.6bn investment in their joint venture.Origin this week said it would share any benefits of the Australian dollar’s depreciation with its US partner. The Australian dollar in July came close to parity against the US dollar but by earlier this month had plunged to less than $0.64 cents as the global credit crisis triggered a sell-off in commodities-based currencies.Reports in Australia suggested Origin may have generated a foreign exchange windfall approaching A$800, which it said it would split with Conoco. Based on one estimate, the Australian dollar’s fall increased the value of the US$5bn initial payment by Conoco by A$784m.There have been a spate of deals this year involving coal bed methane in Australia, where it is known as coal seam gas. Most have been done at successively higher valuations.International oil companies, facing difficulties in securing access to resources in many countries, see Australia as an attractive place to operate, politically stable and convenient for lucrative Asian markets.That has encouraged Conoco, Royal Dutch Shell, Petronas, BG and others to invest in assets in eastern Australia, even though the process of converting coal bed methane into LNG is commercially unproven.Origin said in a statement accompanying its annual general meeting that underlying profit this financial year would be about 30 to 40 per cent higher than the prior year.Kevin McCann, chairman, said Origin’s Australian businesses had performed in line with expectations in the first quarter ended September 30, while Contact Energy, the New Zealand business, had had a more challenging start.“More significantly, there has been dramatic and unpredictable volatility in oil prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates between the Australian dollar and the US and NZ dollars,” Mr McCann said.”Furthermore, the pending completion of the ConocoPhillips transaction which will result in the receipt of US$5bn and the timing and pricing of the previously advised on-market buyback will all significantly affect the outlook for the full financial year,” he said.Grant King, Origin’s managing director, added that Conoco operated in a strong part of the economy.“We have no reason to have any concern over Conoco’s ability to fund the transaction and of course they are a very large and very sound company,” he said.
494;COP;Conocophillips;2008-10-03T18:04:08Z;A disturbing darn debate;;In 1970, Richard Nixon nominated a lacklustre Florida judge and political loyalist named Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court. He was rejected on the grounds that he lacked the gifts for the job, which stung the Nebraska senator Roman Hruska, a Nixon ally. “Even if he were mediocre,” Hruska complained, “there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren’t they? And a little chance?” The nomination of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as John McCain’s vice-presidential nominee has played out much like a modern-day Carswell nomination. Her detractors call her mediocre. Her supporters call her representative.That is why her debate on Thursday night against Barack Obama’s vice-presidential nominee, Delaware senator Joseph Biden, was of potentially election-changing importance. It came the day after Senate passage of a financial bail-out bill and the day before the House was due to vote on it. A shining performance would stabilise the McCain campaign, which has fallen in the polls after a week of failed publicity stunts (a “suspension” of his campaign, which was widely seen as an attempt to duck the first presidential debate) and contradictory pronouncements. A stumble might finish off the McCain campaign altogether. That did not happen. But the debate revealed disturbing things about US politics for all that.Ms Palin can speak well in areas about which she is knowledgeable. As long as the debate was centred on energy, Alaska’s biggest export, she could show off not only her savvy about technology but her personal familiarity with the executive hierarchies of Exxon and ConocoPhillips. The problem is, there are not many areas about which she is knowledgeable. She dodged a lot of questions, not for want of attention span but for want of things to say.She set out to make herself as representative (of middle America) as possible. “I’ll betcha you’re gonna hear some fear,” Ms Palin said in her answer to the first question she got about the economy. She has learnt how to put the Republican platform on taxes into her own words: “Darn right we need tax relief,” she said. She is less clear about Republican principles of personal responsibility: “Darn right it was the predator lenders,” she said, when asked whether debtors or creditors were to blame for the present crisis. And later: “It’s not the American people’s fault that the economy is behaving like it is.”A candidate who really believed that and had been well prepped could have made the evening very uncomfortable for Mr Biden. The issue to use would have been the Senate bankruptcy bill of 2005, which dramatically restricted the recourse to bankruptcy protection that borrowers could claim. (Apparently the lenders knew something we did not.) Few episodes of the past half-decade can more aptly be considered a special-interest legislation for the “predator bankers” of Ms Palin’s description. Most Democrats, including Mr Obama, voted “Nay” on the bill. Mr Biden backed it. Why?The answer may have something to do with Mr Biden’s home state. Delaware has no corporate tax, a business-friendly General Corporation Law and a Court of Chancery that corporations feel at home in. That is why, although only 853,476 people live in Delaware, 280,000 corporations do – about half the US total. The state is a haven for credit-card companies, too, including a good number of fly-by-night ones. Although few Republicans opposed the bill, Mr Biden’s defection from his party would be meat on the plate of any Republican debater. Mr Biden represents – and arguably has gone to bat for – corporations that are dunning Americans in all 50 states.That bankruptcy bill came up in the debate, but it was not Ms Palin who raised it. It was Gwen Ifill, the moderator and a long-time New York Times journalist, who challenged Mr Biden. For all the moaning and groaning that the American right does about how “mainstream” news outlets do not cover the issues fairly, here was a mainstream journalist working to expose Mr Biden’s vulnerabilities in a way that neither Ms Palin nor anyone else in the Republican party has been competent to.As the debate went on, it became clear that Mr Biden did not have a much better idea than Ms Palin of how the economic pieces fit (or do not fit) together. Asked whether the present financial crisis would change their spending plans, Mr Biden suggested that he and Mr Obama might “slow down” implementation of a promise to double foreign aid. That is not much – a smaller-than-anticipated increase in a minuscule (and unpopular) federal programme. Ms Palin was also asked if there was anything she would take off the table. “There is not,” she replied. “And how long have I been at this, like five weeks?”As this column went to press, odds were improving that the Senate’s revision of the financial rescue bill would be passed by the House. The bill has not been streamlined, it has merely had tax cuts larded on top of it – for those who use alternative fuels, for those who do not itemise their deductions, for those who are paying the alternative minimum tax. They come to $110bn (€79bn, £62bn) in all. Republican congressmen suggest that what improves the chances of passage is that it shelters Republican candidates from losing their endorsement from the powerful lobby Americans for Tax Reform.It is astonishing what an unsteerable ship a US presidential campaign is, how little impression has been made by a crisis that has been under way for weeks now. This is a sign that the interests involved are well entrenched. It leads to the troubling suspicion that the US might be darn unreformable.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard
495;COP;Conocophillips;2008-10-02T01:01:26Z;ConocoPhillips appoints new president;;ConocoPhillips, the US’s third largest energy group, on Wednesday promoted John Carrig, the company’s chief financial officer to president and chief operating officer. The move prompted speculation that Mr Carrig would succeed Jim Mulva, chief executive and chairman, who is expected to retire within three years.Several other senior appointments were announced, including that of rising star, Jim Gallogly, who will move to head exploration and production from his current job as executive vice-president of refining, marketing and transportation.John Lowe, ConocoPhillips’s current head of exploration and production will move down to become Mr Mulva’s assistant, and will work part time from the start of next year.The company said in a statement that Mr Lowe had “expressed his desire to reduce the scope of his current activities in order to devote more time to his personal interests”.He had recently played a highly visible role negotiating a $7.8bn coal seam gas deal with Australia’s Origin Energy. The deal scuppered the ambitions of the UK’s BG to take over Origin, but was criticised for having cost ConocoPhillips too much.Prior to negotiating the Origin deal, Mr Lowe had testified on Capitol Hill about high oil prices. The best-remembered part of his testimony was his answering a politically charged question about the size of his compensation by saying he could not remember.On Wednesday Mr Mulva praised Mr Lowe’s contributions to ConocoPhillips, saying: “John Lowe has made significant contributions to ConocoPhillips for more than 25 years.” He added: “Through his active leadership during the course of his career, and particularly in the last decade, he has played a major role in the planning, development and implementation of the strategy and major transactions of the company. We look forward to his continued assistance in his new position.”ConocoPhillips‘ shares were down about 5 per cent on Wednesday, a steeper drop than that of its peer group.
496;COP;Conocophillips;2008-09-15T18:59:07Z;Fears over Texas oil supplies;;Oil and gas groups expressed concerns on Monday about maintaining normal petrol supplies in and around Houston, Texas, with prolonged shutdowns possible in production and refining in the aftermath of hurricanes Gustav and Ike.The US government has released 309,000 barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to make up for shortfalls in oil production, but power outages have shut many stations, refineries and pipelines needed to transport oil and refined products.Most oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico – which supplies 20 per cent of US production – remained offline on Monday, as did 20 per cent of the nation’s refining capacity.Petrol was reported to have surged above $5 a gallon in some places, with the average, nationwide price for regular unleaded at $3.80 a gallon. However, in New York crude oil and and gasoline prices were down in the wake of the Lehman crisis.Chevron, the second biggest US oil producer, said it was concerned about severe gasoline supply disruptions in the wake of hurricane Ike. “It may not be possible for us – and other manufacturers – to maintain normal supplies in the coming days.’’Chevron and other companies said they were sending generators into key stations to provide power. But without power to run Gulf Coast refineries, or pumps to bring crude in and take refined product out, supplies to those petrol stations could run low.Chevron reported flooding at its lubricants plant at Port Arthur, and was making assessments at other Gulf coast facilities.ConocoPhillips, the third biggest company, said all its pipelines in the region were shut down, as were two of its refined products distribution terminals in Texas and Louisiana. The company is checking its refineries for damages.ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil company, and others said they were moving fuel supplies from unaffected areas to help meet any significant shortfalls in the Gulf coast region.The Gulf coast oil and gas industry has been shut since September 1, when hurricane Gustav tore through, followed by hurricane Ike last weekend.Oil companies are moving back out into the Gulf to assess damages and move toward restarting production. At least two rigs and 10 platforms have been reported damaged.John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, said oil prices were dropping, despite the hurricanes’ impact on production, because demand for crude had dropped with the closure of Gulf coast refineries as well as the economic downturn.The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, he said, only fuelled the drop in oil prices.
497;COP;Conocophillips;2008-09-15T08:19:46Z;Australia: Long shots grow more costly;;ConocoPhillips, the US oil group, set a new high-water mark for the value of coal bed methane assets in the Australian state of Queensland in early September when it struck a 50/50 venture to jointly develop reserves owned by Origin Energy.In return for an investment of up to A$9.6bn (US$7.6bn), Conoco saw off rivals also interested in partnering with Origin – Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron and Petronas had all cast their eyes over the Queensland-based group – and scuttled a A$13.8bn hostile takeover bid from BG Group, the UK oil and gas company.The deal is part of the hunt for sometimes unproven reserves that might one day be converted into cleaner-burning fuels and big oil groups’ desire to secure supplies capable of servicing fast-growing markets in Asia.Although converting coal bed methane into LNG is commercially unproven, there has been a succession of transactions this year involving large oil companies that have agreed partnerships with Australian groups owning Queensland assets.After BG bought a 9.9 per cent stake in Queensland Gas Company for about A$700m, Petronas of Malaysia paid $2.5bn for 40 per cent of an LNG project in Queensland alongside Santos, the Australian energy group. The scramble by large well-known oil companies, together with the rising prices being paid for assets still a long way from development, has reinforced the view that Queensland’s coal bed methane fields might one day become a resource of global significance.That is the view taken by John Lowe, Conoco’s head of exploration and production. “There is a renewed metric for valuing these assets,” he told the FT after unveiling the deal. “This is a world-scale project.”“We brought in our technical experts to evaluate the resource. ‘Giddy’ was the direct quote about how they viewed it.”Conoco admits. though, there is a lot of work to be done to tap the coal bed methane reserves and build facilities to convert the gas into LNG before it is shipped to Asia.In return for a 50 per cent stake in Origin’s reserves, Conoco has agreed to pay the Australian group A$6bn upfront. The US oil group will also fund an additional A$1.15bn to carry Origin’s share of development costs to so-called “final investment decision”, expected at the end of 2010, and will make four additonal payments of A$600m.There has been a dramatic re-rating of coal bed methane, known in Australia as coal seam gas, this year. Sandra McCullagh, at Credit Suisse in Sydney, says the deal values Origin’s 2P (proven and probable) reserves at A$4.07 per gigajoule, and its 3P (proven, probable and possible) reserves at A$1.88 per gigajoule.When Petronas bought into Santos’s Queensland coal seam assets in May, the deal valued 2P reserves at A$3.93 a gigajoule and 3P reserves at A$1.32 a gigajoule.If nothing else, the recent flurry of deals will strengthen Australia’s position as the third largest LNG exporter in the Asia Pacific region. The opportunity is large: imports of LNG by Asia Pacific countries are forecast to double in the next decade.
498;COP;Conocophillips;2008-09-10T12:07:10Z;Bulgaria: Energy sector seeks to recover its Balkan role;;Bulgaria’s energy sector is growing but the country is still some way from its goal of becoming a regional hub linking the European Union with the Black Sea rim.The government is committed to joining three international pipeline projects, Nabucco and South Stream for gas and the trans-Balkan oil pipeline from Bulgaria to Greece. But all three are at an early stage of development.“Bulgaria is strategically located for energy transit routes to western Europe, but there are other opportunities in the sector,” says Anthony Hassiotis, chief executive of PostBank, a Sofia-based lender controlled by Greece’s EFG group.The country’s immediate priority is to recover its former role as the leading exporter of electricity to power-hungry Balkan neighbours, following the shutdown of Chernobyl-era units at the Kozloduy nuclear plant as a condition for EU accession in Jan 2007.NEK, the state-controlled electricity company, is due to select a strategic partner by the end of this month for a €5bn ($7bn) nuclear project at Belene on the Danube river. Germany’s RWE and Electrabel of Belgium are bidding.The utility will have a 51 per cent stake in a joint venture to operate two 1,000MW latest-generation units to be built by Russian, French and German contractors. These are due to be completed by 2015.But to compete effectively with central European energy companies, NEK must seek a listing on a western stock exchange or acquire a long-term strategic partner, or both, says Ilian Vassilev, chairman of Deloitte Bulgaria.“We’re still in transition mode. Our energy companies are undercapitalised compared with central Europe so we don’t yet have trans-national players, and the biggest energy company is foreign-owned,” Mr Vassilev says.CEZ, the Czech energy group, and Germany’s Eon have acquired regional electricity distributors, spun off from NEK under the government’s privatisation programme. Both are seen as potential investors in new generating capacity.Lukoil, the private Russian oil group in which ConocoPhillips of the US has a 20 per cent stake, is investing €1bn to upgrade the Neftochim refinery – the largest in south-east Europe – which it acquired in an early privatisation deal.The Russian group this year overtook Petrol Holding, a private Russian-Bulgarian group, as the country’s biggest operator of petrol stations. Lukoil paid €230m for 75 profitable outlets, increasing its market share to around 20 per cent, ahead of Austria’s OMV with around 15 per cent.Neftochim will also supply Akpet, a Turkish network with almost 700 filling stations which Lukoil acquired in July for around $500mIn gas, foreign investors are showing interest in onshore and offshore exploration off the Black Sea coastline and in building storage capacity for natural gas.But the regulatory environment is still undeveloped, while Bulgaria’s dependence on Russia for oil and gas supplies has raised questions about access to local markets for groups based elsewhere in the EU.Concerns over transparency, along with Bulgaria’s slow progress on convergence with EU legal and judicial standards, contribute to a wait-and-see attitude among investors.“For major energy deals the adequate jurisdiction of the legal system is a key element. On the other hand, the more projects there are, the greater the pressure on the government to enforce reforms,” Mr Vassilev says.After reaching a record €5bn last year, foreign direct investment fell by around 30 per cent in the first half following a slowdown in the property market.Yet the economy is still growing strongly at a projected rate of around 5.5 per cent this year, while unemployment has fallen below 6 per cent. Salaries for managers have risen to central European levels, encouraging Bulgarians to return from jobs abroad.“There is productive investment coming in, not only funds for buying property and for banks to meet domestic demand for credit,” Mr Hassiotis says.
499;COP;Conocophillips;2008-09-09T18:09:13Z;BG scraps bid for Origin;;"For the first four months of this year, investors reckoned shares in Origin Energy, the Australian power producer with a nice sideline in coal-seam gas reserves, were worth about A$9 each. According to BG, which launched a takeover bid in May, A$15.50 was a “full and fair” price. The joint venture ConocoPhillips struck with Origin over the weekend implied that it valued the company’s equity at A$28, estimates Citigroup. A concurrent report from an independent Australian corporate finance house goes even higher, as much as A$31. Back in the real world, shares in Origin are changing hands at A$17.40.Wildly differing assessments of value are the hallmark of a bubble. BG is right to take a step back, and allow its offer to lapse. Chief executive Frank Chapman could have paid more. But keeping pace with Conoco would have taken gearing well over 50 per cent. That would have raised questions over how the group would support rising capital expenditure on its Brazilian acreage, not to mention the actual challenge of converting coal-seam gas to liquefied natural gas. Besides, Origin was never a must-have. At current rates of production, BG’s LNG business should easily meet all contracted obligations around Asia and beyond until 2020.Still, the sense of relief that BG will not be drawn into battle has rapidly faded; the company’s shares are back to their subdued levels. Production growth, formerly industry-leading, slowed to about 2 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter – well below the group’s long-term projected range of 5 to 8 per cent. The company’s historically big premium to the sector average in price/cashflow terms has all but vanished. BG has successfully styled itself as the one big growth story among the majors. With or without Origin, it is up to Mr Chapman to prove it.To email the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here"
500;COP;Conocophillips;2008-09-09T17:48:57Z;BG admits defeat in Origin takeover battle;;BG Group, the British oil and gas company, has conceded defeat in its battle for Origin Energy of Australia, saying it would not extend or increase its A$13.8bn ($13.3bn) offer after Origin struck a lucrative gas development deal with ConocoPhillips, the US oil group.Conoco’s planned A$9.6bn investment in a 50/50 joint venture to develop Origin’s coal bed methane assets put a significantly higher valuation on those assets than was implied by the BG bid.Origin’s shares soared further above BG’s A$15.50 offer after the Conoco deal was announced on Monday, as investors bet BG would drop out of the contest.Investors had believed the bid was already a stretch for BG and were reluctant tosee the offer raised any higher.BG’s shares rose almost 6 per cent on Monday as it became clear it was likely to abandon its pursuit of Origin, although they slipped back on Tuesday, closing 4.3 per cent lower as the price of oil fell.Frank Chapman, BG’s chief executive, said: “The price implied by [the Conoco joint venture] is higher than BG Group is able to justify. We have therefore decided not to extend or amend our offer, which we expect will now lapse.”The failure of its bid is a setback for BG’s strategy of building production of liquefied natural gas in the Pacific region.BG is strong in the Atlantic and has been making high profits shipping gas to Japan and other Asian markets. It has also been signing contracts to provide regular supplies to Asian countries such as Singapore.There have been several deals this year involving coal bed methane in Australia, where it is known as coal seam gas.International oil companies, facing difficulties in securing access to resources in many countries, see Australia as an attractive place to operate, politically stable and convenient for lucrative Asian markets.That has encouraged Conoco, Royal Dutch Shell and other companies to invest in assets in eastern Australia, even though the process of converting coal bed methane into LNG is commercially unproven.Following BG’s purchase of a 9.9 per cent stake in Queensland Gas Company for close to A$700m in February, Petronas of Malaysia paid $2.5bn for 40 per cent of an LNG project in Queensland alongside Santos, the Australian energy group.That deal prompted Origin to re-assess the value of its assets and helped break up what had been friendly talks between Origin and BG. Soon after, Origin rejected the UK group’s A$15.50-a- share offer.Mr Chapman said: “We remain firmly committed to Australia and our existing LNG joint venture with QGC, which is progressing well …We wish Origin and ConocoPhillips every success with their joint venture.”
501;COP;Conocophillips;2008-09-08T19:23:50Z;ConocoPhillips and Origin in A$9.6bn venture;;ConocoPhillips, the US oil group, plans to invest up to A$9.6bn (US$7.8bn) jointly to develop coal-seam methane gas assets with Origin Energy, the Australian energy group fighting a hostile A$13.8bn takeover offer from BG Group of the UK.The deal underlines the level of international interest in Australia’s vast energy reserves, particularly cleaner fuels such as liquefied natural gas. ConocoPhillips and Origin plan to convert the gas extracted from coal-bed methane into LNG before it is exported from the Australian state of Queensland to Asia.Although the market is in its infancy, it has been the subject of a spate of deals this year.Following BG’s purchase of a 9.9 per cent stake in Queensland Gas Company for close to A$700m, Petronas of Malaysia paid US$2.5bn for 40 per cent of an LNG project in Queensland alongside Santos, the Australian energy group. That deal led to a re-evaluation of similar assets and helped break up what had been friendly talks between Origin and BG. Soon after, Origin rejected the UK group’s offer of A$15.50 a share.Origin’s deal with ConocoPhillips, together with an independent expert’s report that found the Australian group’s shares were worth A$28.55 to A$30.71, has forced BG to the sidelines with little prospect of it re-entering the fray.Analysts said BG’s current offer was dead, adding Origin had agreed a favourable deal that underlined the worth of its yet-to-be-developed reserves.Shares in Origin, Australia’s largest producer of gas from coal seams, jumped A$2.00, or 13 per cent, to A$17.65 by the end of trading.Under the deal announced to the Australian stock market, Origin plans to become the upstream coal seam gas provider to the project, with Conoco-Phillips taking the role of downstream LNG operator.ConocoPhillips will become a 50 per cent shareholder in the company that owns all of Origin’s CSG interests.“This company will develop these interests into a CSG to LNG project, providing a fully aligned partnership across the LNG value chain,” Origin said.Credit Suisse is advising ConocoPhillips on the transaction, while Macquarie Group is acting for Origin.
502;COP;Conocophillips;2008-09-08T18:59:13Z;Groups move to tap a different pipeline;;"Two of the biggest international oil companies on Monday showed why that tag tells less than half the story.ConocoPhillips’ aggressive plans to invest up to $8bn in an unproven prospect in Australian coal-bed methane, and Eni’s $865m agreed bid for First Calgary Petroleums, a fallen star of the London stock market, show how eager oil companies are to develop their gas businesses.News that Royal Dutch Shell has agreed a deal to develop the gas industry in Iraq, where western companies are still waiting for long-delayed oil contracts, is another example of the trend.Selling gas is generally less profitable than selling oil. Gas typically trades at a significant discount to oil for an equivalent energy content, and it is more expensive to deliver.Oil can be sold anywhere a tanker can pick it up; gas needs to be piped or liquefied and shipped to market.Yet in a world where international oil companies find it increasingly difficult to access resources, gas developments often offer the best hope for growth. Pressure for cleaner forms of electricity generation means the market for gas is growing faster than the market for oil.As Nikos Tsafos of PFC Energy, the consultancy, puts it: “For international oil companies, having a good gas strategy is going to be critical. When the financial community looks at the international oil companies, it will have to ask: what is their gas strategy? Is it effective, will it be profitable?”As the price of oil has risen over the past decade, resource-rich countries have felt emboldened to tighten their grip on foreign companies.Western groups are also facing increasingly assertive competition from emerging economies, such as China and India, when they look for opportunities internationally.Even in Brazil, the scene of the biggest excitement in the industry in recent years, the national oil company Petrobras is dominant in opening up the deepwater offshore areas that are thought to hold vast reserves.Gas reserves, however, still offer IOCs the prospect of being able to exercise a competitive advantage, because of the greater complexity involved in getting the product to market.Integrated companies with gas transportation and marketing businesses, such as Conoco and Eni, can offer resource-rich countries something they need.Western companies also often have technology for gas extraction and transport that national oil companies lack. The IOCs still have a very significant presence in LNG, for example.PFC Energy, the consultancy, said this year that IOCs owned 49 per cent of the world’s capacity for liquefying gas to turn it into LNG, and 72 per cent of the capacity for regasifying it.That compares with the share of the world’s oil and gas reserves to which the IOCs have free access, which is just 7 per cent.The extraction of coal-bed methane, a capital-intensive process that can require the drilling of thousands of wells to develop a big field, is another area where IOCs still have the edge.As many other resource-rich countries have put up barriers to IOCs, there has been a surge in interest in Australia.John Lowe, head of exploration and production at Conoco in Sydney, said yesterday: “These assets were under-appreciated…we should have known better and recognised the value of these resources a year ago, and it would have been less expensive for us.”He said the US energy group’s technical team had been “giddy” after undertaking on-site due diligence on the scale of Origin’s potential reserves.“We have been looking around the world but what the team saw here is a tremendous resource,” he said."
503;COP;Conocophillips;2008-09-08T10:13:26Z;Asian shares rally following US government bailout;;Asia-Pacific equities rallied on Monday as investors were cheered by the US government’s decision to take control of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, alleviating growing concerns about the health of the mortgage giants.Financial stocks were some of the main beneficiaries of the news, with Japanese banks enjoying double digit gains in their share prices. Bonds dropped and the dollar gained Y1 against the Japanese currency from Friday, recently trading at Y108.83.“Taking that [concern of default] element away alleviates a tremendous amount of systemic risk in the market,” said Joseph Kraft, head of capital markets Japan, at Dresdner Kleinwort.However, problems beyond the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) still remain, Mr Kraft pointed out.“Maybe the better characterisation is that it took away the uncertainty over the GSEs, but if you look at the entire financial problem, the GSEs are not the only problem and the rest still remains.”“We may have one day of euphoria but when we come in tomorrow morning, we’re going to know that Washington Mutual is still under stress, Lehman, regional banks, all these other issues still remain,” Mr Kraft said.Taiwanese and South Korean stocks led the rally across Asia, with Taiwanese shares rising 5.6 per cent to 6,658.69, the biggest daily gain in six years, and bouncing off a two-year low it set on Friday. Cathay Financial gained 6.8 per cent to T$57.60.The Kospi rose 5.2 per cent at 1,476.65, its biggest daily gain in more than a year. Kookmin Bank rose 8.9 per cent to Won61,000, joining in the Asia-Pacific wide rally in financial shares, but also gaining from the approval it won Friday to go ahead with a plan to set up a holding company.The Korean won had its biggest daily gain in more than a decade as shares surged, boosting demand for the currency and amid speculation that the Korean government could be selling dollars.The Korea Exchange suspended programme trading for five minutes due to a computer glitch as prices soared, South Korea’s bourse operator said.The Nikkei 225 rose 3.4 per cent to 12,624.46, rising from its lowest close on Friday since March 18 and its biggest daily gain since April 2. The broader Topix gained 3.9 per cent to 1,216.41.The Topix banking sub index surged the most in16 years, rallying 12 per cent. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial jumped 15 per cent to Y674,000, the biggest daily gain since it formed in 2002 through a merger, while Mizuho Financial increased 12 per cent to Y463,000 and Mitsubishi UFJ rose 13 per cent to Y850.Separately, Mitsubishi UFJ said it would more than double its stake in consumer finance company Acom, paying $1.4bn to do so. Acom shares closed 3.6 per cent higher at Y3,130.Exporters gained after the dollar rose against the Japanese currency, with Toyota closing 4 per cent higher at Y4,940, while Nissan rose 3 per cent to Y824 and Sony gained 3.9 per cent to Y4,030.Nomura Holdings gained 9.7 per cent to Y1,501, rallying alongside the other banks, and also on the back of a local report citing the brokerage’s president saying the company was considering investing in Lehman Brothers.Stocks in Hong Kong gained 4.3 per cent to 20,794.27, the biggest daily gain since March, while the sub index of mainland Chinese shares traded in the territory rose 4.1 per cent to 11,136.34. HSBC led the gains on the Hang Seng with a 5.5 per cent gain to HK$123.70. China Mobile gained 4.8 per cent to HK$85/90 and China Construction Bank rose 3.3 per cent to HK$6.20.In Australia, where banks’ share prices had suffered, shares rose 3.9 per cent to 5,067.5, led by financials.Macquarie Group gained 15 per cent to A$48.31, Commonwealth Bank of Australia gained 7.9 per cent to A$44.87, and ANZ Banking Group increased 8.2 per cent to A$17.60.Origin Energy shares gained 13 per cent to A$17.65, following its announcement it would partner with ConocoPhillips to develop coal steam gas through a liquefied natural gas project as it aims to put a stop to a hostile bid from the UK’s BG Group.Shanghai shares bucked the trend, dropping 2.7 per cent to 2,143.421, as concerns about economic growth and deteriorating investor sentiment continued to dog the market.In Karachi, shares were trading slightly lower, down 0.5 per cent at 9,296.23 after a brief rally when the market opened following presidential elections won by Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Pakistan’s assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Investors remain cautious about buying shares following the recent political upheaval which has caused the stock market to fall 41 per cent since a peak in April.In India, shares were trading 3.2 per cent higher at 14,953.73.In Thailand, shares gained 3.1 per cent to 656.66.With additional reporting by Andrew Wood in Hong Kong
504;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

The materials sector, down 9.2 per cent over the period, shed another 2.5 per cent on Tuesday.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dipped 7 per cent to $83.05, Monsanto fell 4.3 per cent to $109.34 and US Steel lost 10.3 per cent to $119.39.Airline, automaker and consumer discretionary stocks helped the S&P 500 briefly break through the psychologically important 1,300 mark.However, the broader market gave up early gains. By the close however, the broader index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,277.55.Richard Parker, managing director of institutional equity trading at Stanford Financial said the morning rally “didn’t have an a awful lot of legs to it”.Analysts at JPMorgan’s Private Bank said: “Investors return from their summer holidays facing the same uncertainties as when they left . . . [Still] the current investor caution makes us think that equity prices may already be discounting many of the risks we’ve been concerned about.”Financials lost steam as the day progressed, although most banks held on to some modest gains. Bank of America climbed 3.4 per cent to $32.20 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares on the basis of “long-term earnings power” and near-term capital options which could help it avoid issuing common equity.Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, briefly advanced after reports that Korea Development Bank was in talks to buy a stake in the securities firm. At the close, Lehman shares were up 0.3 per cent to $16.13.Citigroup added 0.6 per cent to $19.11 while JPMorgan rose 1.3 per cent to $38.99 and the S&P 500 financials sector rose 1.8 per cent.Regions Financial also made progress, jumping 19.2 per cent to $11.05. The Alabama-based bank said it had assumed about $900m in total deposits from Integrity Bank, a failed bank.Meanwhile, the weaker-than-expected impact of Hurricane Gustav gave other energy-sensitive stocks a boost. Airline companies UAL, Delta and AMR soared 11.7 per cent to $12.41, 12.8 per cent to $9.17 and 11.3 per cent to $11.50.Automakers General Motors and Ford added 6.5 per cent to $10.65 and 1.12 per cent to $4.51.The broader consumer discretionary sector also made strong gains, led by consumer services and retail stocks as investors bet that falling oil prices would boost spending power.Carnival, the cruise operator, rose 5.6 per cent to $39.13, while Lowe’s added 6.9 per cent to $26.33. The sector as a whole rose 1.8 per cent.That, early positive momentum helped markets to glide past some weak macroeconomic data released in the mid-morning, showing a stagnant manufacturing sector and a further decline in construction spending.Since its low point on July 15, the benchmark S&P 500 index has bounced about
5.2 per cent, partly because of a 24.3 per cent drop in the price of oil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 2.1 per cent in early trading before giving up those gains to close at 11,516.92, down 0.2 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,349.24.In technology, Xerox climbed 3.1 per cent to $14.36 after Citi initiated coverage with a “buy” recommendation and a $20 price target.The office equipment maker had “perhaps the most compelling enterprise services portfolio of any company in the market”, Citi said.News that Google released its own internet browser initially helped the stock advance. But the moves were not enough to keep the sector in the black and it swung to losses of 1.4 per cent. Google shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $465.25."
506;COP;Conocophillips;2008-08-28T22:22:04Z;Gulf storm shuts US oil and gas production;;The US oil and gas industry began to shut down production in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday after forecasters predicted that tropical storm Gustav would be a hurricane when it hit the region.Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips led the majors in evacuating personnel and ceasing production.The Gulf produces 20 per cent of US oil and gas supplies. Prices in New York topped $120 a barrel but fell after the International Energy Agency said strategic stocks would be released if disruptions were serious.Jeffrey Rubin, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said production had not returned to the 2005 levels before Katrina and Rita struck. The Gulf produces 1.3m barrels per day of oil, down from 1.6m then.“It underscores the vulnerability of the only area in the US where energy production is growing,’’ Mr Rubin said.He noted production in the Gulf has been undermined since 2005 by maturing fields and limited personnel and equipment to commit to new projects. Many resources were initially focused on rebuilding infrastructure damaged by the storms and then moved to more promising parts of the world.Kevin Witt, forecaster at the AccuWeather Hurricane Center, said Gustav would pummel Jamaica on Thursday, but mountains would probably weaken it.After passing the Cayman Islands, the storm is likely to ramp up into a Category 3 hurricane and make landfall along the Gulf coast late on Monday or early Tuesday.“Gustav looks like it could be heading into the heart of the Gulf’s oil-producing area,” Mr Witt said. He added that precautions should be taken from the Louisiana-Texas border to the Alabama-Florida border. New Orleans, devastated by the 2005 hurricanes, was in the “red zone”.The entire Gulf coast should be on guard, he said, because the storm could shift direction, stall or build into a Category 5 hurricane, the most damaging. Even if the storm hit 600 miles away, he added, it could hammer Gulf platforms with strong waves and winds.In Texas emergency managers are preparing the entire coast and officials contemplate an influx of refugees from Louisiana, if the storm lands there, as happened in 2005. Ahead of Rita, evacuation routes from Houston were impassable and fuel shortages hampered those trying to flee.In New Orleans 3,000 national guardsmen are standing by as officials contemplate forced evacuations. After Katrina killed 1,600 people in Louisiana and Mississippi in massive flooding, state and national officials were accused of not adequately protecting residents.Ray Nagin, mayor of New Orleans, left the Democratic National Convention to return to his city. Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, declared a state of emergency to speed federal assistance if the hurricane hits.Kenneth Medlock, energy expert at Rice University, said the potential for long-term damage to the industry was less than in 2005 because older facilities had been replaced. But a direct hit could significantly reduce production.“Anything that shuts in production has the potential to raise crude oil and natural gas prices quickly, especially in the tight global situation we are in now,” Mr Medlock said.Additional reporting from wire services
507;COP;Conocophillips;2008-08-17T16:56:22Z;Buoyant oil cities give office market a lift;;Pumped-up oil prices are buoying commercial property in some US cities closely linked to the commodity, even as most of the rest of the country succumbs to a dramatic real-estate slump.Houston and Dallas – large hubs of the energy industry – were the best-performing cities in the US in the first half of this year for office property sales, although the volume of deals done still fell 12 per cent and 23 per cent respectively, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.But that compares with a drop of 92 per cent in sales in Orange County, a Californian district that is badly hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, or 61 per cent drop in sales in Washington DC, where commercial property is considered to have been relatively resilient.On average, office sales fell 67 per cent nationwide in the first half.The relative health of the property markets in oil boom cities comes as the vitality of the energy industry contrasts with shell-shocked financial services companies, which are shedding staff, encouraging property investors to shift their focus to cities where oil businesses are based.Brookfield Properties, which controls more office space in North America than any other public company, plans to sell some of its buildings in New York and Washington and plough cash into Houston and Calgary, according to Ric Clark, its chief executive.“We’re liable to do either new acquisitions or new development in [Houston and Calgary], so we’ll grow in those markets, for sure,” said Mr Clark in an interview with the FT.Mr Clark added: “In our view, oil is not going back down to $30 a barrel, and energy is a depleting commodity, and so I think these are great markets to be in right now.”The fortunes of commercial property is typically tied to the employment picture and economic outlook, and in Houston and Dallas, the picture is at present relatively rosy.In the Federal Reserve’s beige book report on the conditions of regional economies in July, the Dallas Fed that said it was experiencing “steady, moderate economic growth” while many other parts of the country reported weak or no growth.Houston’s job market expanded at the fastest rate in the country in the second quarter, according to the Greater Houston Partnership and the Texas Workforce Commission.ExxonMobil, the largest oil company in the US, has headquarters in Irving on the outskirts of Dallas, although it employs more people in its Houston offices. Exxon delivered the largest profits in US history in its last quarter.Houston is also the home to the headquarters of ConocoPhillips, the third biggest US oil company, as well as many other oil services businesses that have been boosted by the soaring price of oil.Commercial property in Dallas, which is less entwined with the energy industry than Houston, has also been lifted by its position as a commercial hub – it is a major regional centre for distribution, healthcare and IT.“I think that in this environment more capital is steered to the places considered safe havens,” said Dan Fasulo, managing director at Real Capital Analytics. “Investors feel more comfortable with the energy story coming out of these markets.“Meanwhile, demand for office space in the cities has actually been driven more by oil services firms than the oil giants.“The folks helping support some of the functions of the oil majors have grown at a faster clip than the oil majors themselves,” said Matt Khourie, president of the real estate company Trammell Crow’s south-east business.Kellogg Brown Root, the engineering and construction company spun out of Halliburton, is building a sprawling new campus in the suburbs of Houston, while Foster Wheeler, an engineering company, has recently agreed to expand into 13-storey, 330,000 sq ft office in the western part of the city.The strength of the energy-rich cities comes after commercial property has been badly hit by the credit crisis, causing banks to clamp down sharply on lending and removing a key source of cheap debt as the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities has dried up.However, Houston has not been spared the fallout from the financial industry strife and weakening economy, according to Mr Khourie.Financing for new building has practically dried up and businesses are expected to take up about a third less office space this year than last – in spite of record oil prices boosting profits.“The capital front that has hit the rest of the country has hit Houston,” he said. “Relatively speaking it’s still attractive.“We’re going to get more than our fair share of capital out there, but it’s not of the same quantity or exuberance we saw 12 months ago.”
508;COP;Conocophillips;2008-08-15T20:50:21Z;Retailer strength helps lift Wall Street;;"US stocks climbed modestly on Friday in a quiet session of trading, and made slight gains for the week, as oil prices dropped back and investors digested some positive results from retailers.Kohl’s kicked off the day in positive fashion, reporting second-quarter profit that fell less than expected. The company also forecast full-year profit ahead of previous expectations and the shares rose 7.1 per cent to $51.70.JC Penney also cheered investors with a smaller- than-expected decline in
second-quarter profit. JC Penney shares rose 8.4 per cent to $39.94.Meanwhile, Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen-focused clothing retailer, and Nordstrom, the department store chain, posted less impressive results but investors were resilient. Abercrombie held steady at $52.59 while Nordstrom rose 4.4 per cent to $31.54.The consumer discretionary sector added 1 per cent. Retailers have outperformed this earnings season, with S&P 500 constituents posting profit declines of about 5 per cent on average. That compares with an average drop of 23 per cent for S&P 500 companies.The leading equity indices received a boost from a sharp fall in commodity prices. Oil fell as much as $3 while gold dropped well below $800.Bijal Shah, global chief economist at Société Générale, said: “US consumer firepower, which had been decimated by the sharp rise in energy prices into the summer months . . . is likely to recover over the coming months.”In consumer staples, Wal-Mart Stores added 2.2 per cent to $59.37 and Procter & Gambleclimbed 2.7 per cent to $71.60, helping the sector to advance 1 per cent.Reports showing a small uptick in consumer confidence and a bump in manufacturing activity in New York state in August also lifted sentiment.General Electric shares rose 1 per cent to $29.80 while Manitowoc added 4.5 per cent to $24.96 and Paccar climbed 4.8 per cent to $44.81.Eight of the 10 leading industry groups gained ground, helping the benchmark S&P 500 advance 0.4 per cent to 1,298.2.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 11,659.9 and the Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.1 per cent to 2,452.52.Over another volatile week in which oil prices ticked higher before resuming their retreat, the S&P 500 fought its way to a 0.1 per cent gain – its third in a row. The Dow fell 0.7 per cent while the Nasdaq added 1.4 per cent.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performers this week, adding 2.4 per cent, thanks to some solid earnings reports from the likes of Estée Lauder.Financials were the biggest losers after another round of writedowns and analyst downgrades and further developments in the auction rate securities fiasco.Goldman Sachs fell 7.5 per cent to $163.18 over the week while JPMorgan lost 8.2 per cent to $38.07 and Bank of America slid 5.6 per cent to $30.70.On Friday, banks fared better after S&P affirmed the credit ratings of the two largest bond insurers. MBIA and Ambac added 8.7 per cent to $11.22 and 24.6 per cent to $5.68, respectively, while the sector added 1.1 per cent.Jim Smigiel, head of investment strategy at SEI, said: “The Ambacs and MBIAs of the world are going to survive - that is how low the bar is at this point. Valuations are such that you don’t have to paint the rosiest picture to make gains in this market.”The pullback in commodities was less kind to energy and materials stocks.On Friday, Newmont Mining slid 3.2 per cent to $41.51, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 2.8 per cent to $84.39 while US Steel fell 3 per cent to $130.88.The energy sector fell back 1.8 per cent and has now lost ground in seven of the past eight sessions. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips gave up 0.5 per cent to $77.07 and 2.2 per cent to $77.66, respectively."
509;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Buffett snaps up NRG stake;;Warren Buffett has bought a stake in NRG Energy, the US power producer, and has sold most of his shares in brewer Anheuser-Busch.Mr Buffett’s timely investments have helped the billionaire amass one of the world’s largest fortunes and win the devotion of legions of disciples eager to mimic the Sage of Omaha’s stock picks. NRG’s shares had jumped more than 4 per cent by midday Friday in New York, while Anheuser-Busch was little changed.Mr Buffett, who reported the latest quarterly changes to his portfolio of US stocks in a regulatory filing late on Thursday, also made an undisclosed transaction involving his shares of ConocoPhillips.US securities regulators permit Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Mr Buffett, to omit certain transactions from the quarterly list and report them in a separate, confidential filing.Berkshire has disclosed that it owned 17.5m shares of ConocoPhillips. In Thursday’s filing with the ÛS Securities & Exchange Commission, the stake disappeared from its list of investments. The stock slipped more than 2 per cent.Mr Buffett also added to his positions in Ingersoll-Rand, a maker of refrigeration gear, and Sanofi Aventis, the French drugmaker. Meanwhile, Ingersoll had acquired Trane, another Berkshire holding as of March. Berkshire owned 3.2m shares of NRG on June 30. The conglomerate reduced its stake in Anheuser to about 13.8m shares during the period from 35.6m in March, according to the SEC filing.Anheuser’s shares had surged more than 29 per cent during those three months as Belgium’s InBev made an unsolicited bid for its US rival. The company agreed to the sale at $70 a share in July. The stock now trades at about $68.Berkshire has said that its quarterly profit fell 7.6 per cent to $2.88bn, or $1,859 per class A share, amid a slump in its insurance-underwriting division. Gains from investments and derivatives totalled $610m during the period.Unrealised gains on investments, or the value those securities that Berkshire has not sold, dropped by $10.7bn during the first six months of the year.
510;COP;Conocophillips;2008-07-29T20:51:54Z;Wall St shrugs off writedowns and housing data;;US stocks shrugged off news of further writedowns in the financial sector and some weak housing data to make steep gains on Tuesday due to a sharp drop in oil prices and decent earnings reports.Oil prices fell about $3, prolonging a four-week slump that has seen prices tumble from more than $145 a barrel to about $122.That news, and an unexpected rise in the Conference Board’s gauge of consumer confidence, helped trigger broad equity advances.Nine of the 10 top industry groups were in positive territory. Consumer discretionary stocks added 3.3 per cent, industrials gained 2.7 per cent and technology posted a 2.1 per cent rise.The moves helped offset news of an $8.5bn stock offering from Merrill Lynch. After the close on Monday, the brokerage also announced a further $5.7bn in writedowns on certain mortgage securities.The International Monetary Fund said the US housing crisis could continue for some time and stood by its estimate that losses for the banking system could reach $1,000bn, sending financials into a tailspin.As if to underline that thesis, the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite home price index dropped 15.8 per cent in May compared with a year earlier.That was the biggest decline since 2001, but was smaller than expected, and housebuilding stocks rallied 9.1 per cent.The news from Merrill heartened some analysts.Meredith Whitney, of Oppenheimer, noted that the stock was closer to “fairly valued levels” and applauded the “purging of assets as an attempt to cut its losses and focus on stabilising its platform and righting the franchise towards growth”. Analysts at CreditSights, a research provider, noted the moves made Merrill “more appealing as a takeout candidate.”Investors seemed to agree and Merrill’s shares overturned early losses to gain 7.8 per cent to $26.25. The S&P 500 financials index surged 7.5 per cent, led by an 8.2 per cent advance for regional banks and a 9.7 per cent gain for diversified banks such as Wachovia and Wells Fargo.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 2.3 per cent higher at 1,263.2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.4 per cent at 11,397.56 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.5 per cent higher at 2,319.62.The second-quarter earnings season continued apace. So far, about 255 companies in the S&P 500 have reported and, on average, earnings have dropped 22.8 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. Financials were the worst performers, posting a 90.2 per cent decline, but excluding that sector, profits rose 8 per cent.Overnight, Amgen, the biotechnology company, reported that net income fell 7.7 per cent due to poor sales of certain anaemia drugs. But the fall was smaller than expected and it raised its full-year earnings forecasts. Amgen’s shares rose 3 per cent to $62.28.In the consumer staples sector, Colgate-Palmolive also beat expectations, posting a 19 per cent increase in profit as it passed on costs to the consumer and achieved strong sales in Asia and Latin America. Colgate’s shares rose 8.2 per cent to $74.15, leading the broader sector to a 2 per cent gain.In the consumer discretionary sector, McGraw-Hill said profit fell 23 per cent, but the education and financial services company re-affirmed its 2008 earnings forecasts and its shares rose 6.9 per cent to $39.78.The drop in oil prices proved a boon to the likes of Dillard’s and General Motors. The pair added 8.3 per cent to $10.43 and 8.2 per cent to $11.90 respectively.Consumer-facing technology groupsbounced back from Monday’s sell-off. Ebay, Apple and Dell climbed 3 per cent to $25.52, 1.7 per cent to $157.08 and 3.3 per cent to $24.01 respectively.In industrials, transportation stocks led the gainers with a 4.5 per cent advance. Ryder System added 5.7 per cent to $68.35, UPS added 3.3 per cent to $63.31. FedEx rose 5.2 per cent to $82.12.Material stocks were among the leading gainers, advancing 2.2 per cent thanks in part to US Steel. The company said second-quarter profits more than doubled on higher steel prices. US Steel’s shares rose 14.1 per cent to $165.76.The oil moves were less positive for energy stocks. ConocoPhillips dipped 2.4 per cent to $80.27 while Schlumberger slid 1.4 per cent to $96.23.
511;COP;Conocophillips;2008-07-29T18:43:27Z;Nationals’ champion: How the energy-rich rely on Schlumberger;;Andrew Gould is quietly becoming one of the most powerful men in the oil industry, so much so that he feels compelled to reassure the world’s biggest energy groups that he has no intention of making them redundant. “We do not, cannot and would not replace what oil companies do with things we can’t do,” says the chief executive of Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, in a rare interview.Yet the list of things Schlumberger cannot do has shrunk so dramatically that many national oil companies (NOCs) can now forgo the costly and politically tricky step of forming partnerships with international oil companies to tap their own oilfields. For the likes of ExxonMobil, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, that means losing the most lucrative part of their business – the part they have relied on to achieve growth in production, revenue and reserves for much of their existence.Euan Baird, Mr Gould’s predecessor, liked to quip that when he joined Schlumberger, on an assignment to Shell Brunei in the 1960s, the only service Shell did not itself own was wireline logging – measuring rocks by feeding cables with sensors down oilfield boreholes. That shifted gradually over the following decades, as low oil prices prompted Shell and others to shed their oil services divisions, shutter their research labs and sever their ties with a generation of engineers and geologists.Schlumberger and others stepped into the void and since have been in a sense democratising the industry, enabling NOCs and small independent operators to chip away at the energy majors’ market share. As crude prices rose to record highs, that paid off for all involved. Now, the industry is entering its next phase – and one question is whether the oil services groups will be able to take on the task of helping the oil majors extract crude from the world’s most difficult deposits.When an exploration executive at one big European oil company said at a recent gathering that Schlumberger “has sent us into an identity crisis and forced us to question what it is we bring to the table”, none of the handful of industry colleagues standing beside him dissented. An executive in the strategy group of another European oil company warns that Schlumberger needs to be careful not to let tensions escalate by neglecting its relationship with IOCs, even though they are no longer its biggest clients (see chart).In fact, Schlumberger’s biggest clients by revenue are independent oil companies – which do not have refining and marketing divisions – and its fastest growing revenue stream comes from its second largest client group: the NOCs. Spending by the group of 42 NOCs – which include those in Russia, where Schlumberger has doubled its workforce in the past two years – has increased 3.5 times, significantly faster than expenditure by the six biggest international energy groups, which has almost doubled. “Part of that is who can invest,” says Mr Gould, adding: “It is a sign also of the NOCs’ evolution over the past four to five years.”NOCs fall broadly into two categories: those rich in resources and active mainly at home, and those seeking to tap oil and gas abroad. The resource holders’ category is led by Saudi Aramco, which has the world’s biggest oil reserves exclusively at its disposal. The “seekers” are led by cash-rich Chinese companies such as PetroChina, whose primary job it is to find enough oil to fuel their country’s rapid economic growth, and the sophisticated duo of Brazil’s Petrobras and Norway’s StatoilHydro, the closest in ability to international oil companies. None of these, however, could do their jobs without Schlumberger or other oil service companies such as Halliburton, its biggest competitor.But Schlumberger, which is three times the size of Halliburton in market capitalisation, has several advantages over its peers. First, 40 years ago the company decided to create a workforce – and eventually a management team – that represented the countries in which it did business. Schlumberger’s top 50 management positions are today held by people of 20 different nationalities. Among those who report directly to Mr Gould – a Briton – are two Americans, two executives from France, one Lebanese, one Moroccan and one Canadian. In comparison, ExxonMobil’s four-man management team hails entirely from the US and the only nations apart from the Netherlands and the UK represented on the Anglo-Dutch Shell’s executive team – one of the industry’s most international – are Switzerland and the US.Schlumberger’s cosmopolitan approach has also helped the company add new blood: it recruits 1,000-5,000 graduates each year from 200 universities in 80 countries, at a time when Americans and Europeans are choosing finance and information technology over engineering and science.Second, the group reaps the benefits of having been incorporated in the Dutch Antilles (as a private company in the 1950s – the listing came in New York in 1962). Unbeholden to any single big government, Schlumberger can operate in places such as Iran, where international political tensions have recently forced Shell, Total, BP and Halliburton to retreat. Mr Gould admits: “There is a huge value in independence and neutrality …The only place we will not work is if there is a UN embargo.”One area where IOCs still have an advantage is the complex and costly process of liquefying and shipping natural gas. But even in LNG, the international oil groups are feeling the squeeze as countries question why they should pay any more than a contractor’s fee.Total of France may have won the right to help Gazprom, Russia’s state gas company, to develop the giant Shtokman field but its financial terms are likely to resemble those of Schlumberger rather than the lucrative production sharing agreements on which IOCs have until now relied for their enviable profit margins. It is even uncertain whether Total will be able to book Shtokman’s reserves. Mr Gould expects this trend will spread: “Oil companies going to projects where they don’t own reserves will increase. The question is how the stock market will value them.”If recent years are anything to go by, the answer is: poorly. As oil prices have quadrupled since 2003, Schlumberger’s total return to shareholders has been 370 per cent. ExxonMobil, arguably the most successful but also the biggest of the international oil companies, returned 155 per cent.Some argue that much of the injury sustained by international oil companies in recent decades has been self-inflicted. After the oil price collapse of 1986, they concentrated on reducing costs and, eventually, consolidating. Between 1998 and 2002, Exxon merged with Mobil, BP took over Amoco and Arco, Total bought Petrofina and Elf, and Conoco merged with Phillips. The service industry underwent a similar process: enlarged companies invested in multiple service lines to stay competitive and widened the international scope of their operations. That suited the big oil companies, which hired them to carry out the work they used to do themselves.But that has cost them their edge in many areas and national oil companies have turned to service companies to help them grab a bigger share of the profits as oil prices have risen. In so doing they have squeezed ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell and their peers further into the high-risk margins of the industry, such as drilling in ultra-deep waters, mining tar-like extra heavy oil and developing projects above the Arctic Circle.National oil companies are using Schlumberger and its rivals not only to furnish their wells but for R&D and training. Schlumberger has research operations in Russia and Saudi Arabia and technological centres in Mexico, Abu Dhabi and Malaysia, while it also provides training for young engineers. This is especially important to many oil-rich nations, which have bitter memories of being forced to defer to IOCs in the early decades of their emergence as petrostates and are seeking to improve the sophistication of their own oil companies while securing employment for rapidly growing populations.Mr Gould (left) is unapologetic about the plight of the international energy groups. “IOCs don’t have an access problem for anything but conventional oil,” he says, adding that the growth of the service industry “does make what we do available to everybody – and that is what might annoy them”.There is still one notable contrast between Schlumberger and big international oil companies, says Ben Dell, an analyst who tracks oil services companies for Sanford Bernstein, the financial services group. “Schlumberger does not put capital at risk on major projects, which is the big difference. They have certainly closed the technology gap, so ExxonMobil and others have less to offer, but until they want to put billions of dollars of their money into projects there is still a big difference.”In return, the Shells and Chevrons of the world seek access to reserves they can “book” with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, and by which investors then measure the health and attractiveness of the company. In contrast, Schlumberger is simply paid cash for what it does – a far more palatable option for NOCs wary of being seen as giving away their citizens’ riches.For now, that divergence will remain. Schlumberger still depends on IOCs for roughly one-quarter of its income and Mr Gould has been careful to reassure his clients that he will not go head-to-head with them. Indeed, keeping IOCs happy will become an even more important task for him in the coming three to five years as the huge number of drilling rigs that international oil companies have ordered go into service in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Angola and Brazil. Schlumberger has been slower than some competitors to get into the deep-water business.Even so, that will be the next area of growth for the company – and there international oil companies have the upper hand over national competitors except Petrobras and StatoilHydro. ExxonMobil, BP, Total, Chevron and Shell will thus regain their importance within Schlumberger’s client list.Whether or not it can forge successful partnerships it will help determine whether enough supplies come on to the market to curb further oil price rises. Success is far from assured, because they will be extracting oil from some of the trickiest locations on earth, with untried technology and an inexperienced workforce. Schlumberger’s future standing will in large part be determined by whether Mr Gould and his international cadre of young engineers are able to deliver.
512;COP;Conocophillips;2008-07-23T21:39:09Z;Wall Street advances as oil prices drop;;US stocks advanced for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices dropped sharply and lawmakers moved closer to a deal on legislation to backstop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Crude oil prices fell back for a second day, slipping below $125 a barrel and helping to offset some mixed earnings reports from consumer-oriented companies.In the consumer discretionary sector, Whirlpool shares added 12.5 per cent to $76.69 after the appliance maker said second-quarter profits had fallen less than expected. The sector advanced 2 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, Costco Wholesale said earnings would be “well below” Wall Street expectations as it had absorbed some recent hikes in energy prices to attract customers. Costco fell 11.9 per cent to $63.43. Wal-Mart Stores slid 1.6 per cent to $58.09 while Kroger lost 2.3 per cent to $28.18.There was some better news from PepsiCo and McDonald’s, which both beat analyst estimates for their quarterly results.PepsiCo rose 2.3 per cent to $67.72 but McDonald’s slipped 0.8 per cent to $59.66. The sector rose 0.5 per cent.In industrials, Boeing, the aerospace group and CH Robinson, the logistics provider, both undershot Wall Street expectations while Norfolk Southern, the railway company, outperformed.Boeing and CH Robinson fell 3.7 per cent to $66.72 and 15.6 per cent to $49.56, respectively. Norfolk, however, added 6.5 per cent to $69.96, helping the industrial sector advance 1.1 per cent.Seven of the 10 leading industry groups closed in the black, nudging the benchmark S&P 500 up 0.4 per cent at 1,282.12 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent higher at 11,632.38 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent ahead at 2,325.88 points.On Tuesday, stocks overturned early losses to surge in late trading after oil fell back and the new chief executive of Wachovia announced a turnround plan, prompting a powerful rally in banks.Financials climbed for a second session on Wednesdsay as lawmakers prepared to vote on a bill that would authorise the Treasury secretary to inject capital into the two government-sponsored entities if needed with only limited restrictions as part of a broader package to address the housing crisis.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, said: “The power of [the] blank cheque is huge in terms of restoring confidence in the major players of the mortgage market – Fannie and Freddie. Just having that there is psychologically very important to the market.”Fannie Mae climbed 11.9 per cent to $15 and Freddie Mac added 11.3 per cent to $10.80. The financial sector added as much as 4.6 per cent before paring gains to 1.9 per cent.Amid the positive sentiment, investors could not overlook poor results from Washington Mutual. The largest US savings and loans company, said it had lost $3.33bn in the second quarter, significantly more than forecast.Washington Mutual shares, which have lost about 88 per cent of their value in the past year, slumped 20.1 per cent to $4.65.The technology sector was also in focus. Overnight, Yahoo said second-quarter profits dropped 18 per cent to $131.2m on higher development costs and declining advertising spending.The company also reduced its full-year revenue forecast and the shares dropped 4.7 per cent to $20.39.EMC, the maker of storage-computers, was the leading sector gainer, however, surging 13.7per cent to $14.17 after it posted estimate-beating second-quarter profits and boosted its 2008 sales target. The technology sector advanced 1.4 per cent.Telecom stocks were the best performers on Wednesday. AT&T, the telephone carrier, said second-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent to $3.77bn, helping the shares to advance 3.9 per cent to $33.06 and the sector to add 3.4 per cent - its biggest one day gain since late January.As oil prices dropped, energy stocks were again a weak spot in spite of some solid earnings from ConocoPhillips. The third-largest US oil producer posted a record $5.44bn second-quarter profit thanks to soaring gas and oil prices. Still, investors were not satisfied and the shares fell 2.9 per cent to $81.83. The sector dipped 3.8 per cent
513;COP;Conocophillips;2008-07-23T15:56:23Z;Conoco surges on back of record oil prices;;Conoco on Wednesday reported second-quarter net income of $5.4bn, or $3.50 per share, up sharply from $301m, or 18 cents per share, for the same quarter in 2007.The year-ago figures included a $4.5bn impairment associated with the expropriation of the company’s Venezuelan assets. Second-quarter 2007 earnings, adjusted for the Venezuela impairment, were $4.8bn, or $2.90 per share.Underneath the strong headline numbers however were clear signs of the difficulties oil companies are having passing on the high cost of crude to petrol and other refined products.The weakening US economy and reduced spending at the pump left the US’ third biggest oil major with $664m in refining and marketing net income, down from $2.4bn in the previous year.Revenues rose to $71.4bn from $47.4bn last year.Conoco shares were down just over 1 per cent at $83.27 by lunchtime in New York.
514;COP;Conocophillips;2008-07-15T20:49:28Z;Wall Street dominated by volatile trading;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 11,000 for the first time since February 2006 on Tuesday as fears about the financial sector, a dramatic fall in oil prices and news that the SEC planned to limit short-selling played against one another.The volatile day began in typically gloomy fashion with financials under particular pressure after a number of analyst downgrades, a banking-led sell-off in European and Asian markets and some poor results.Meredith Whitney, an analyst at Oppenheimer, downgraded Wachovia from “perform” to “underperform” slashing her full year 2008 and 2009 estimates and warned that the outlook for equity shareholders was “bleak”.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “The likely need for additional capital to replace expected future losses is putting significant pressure on bank equities broadly . . . In many cases, the equities are down 40-60 per cent over the prior three months. This amounts to a shadow run on several banks.” Still, financials pared early losses as investors bought back into some of the stocks most heavily sold on Monday. By late-
afternoon the sector was down 3 per cent, having bounced off losses of as much as 5.7 per cent.Washington Mutual shares rallied 11.8 per cent to $3.61 after it said it was “well capitalised”. First Horizon, meanwhile, jumped 17 per cent to $5.89 after it reported second-quarter results largely in line with expectations and announced a new chief executive.State Street made ground, rising 7.1 per cent to $59.65 after posting big profit and revenue jumps in the second-quarter.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also pared losses, but only briefly, after Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said his agency would limit short-sales in the shares of the two government-sponsored entities and brokerage firms.The pair slumped 27.3 per cent to $7.07 and 26 per cent to $5.26. Wachovia cut its losses to 7.7 per cent at $9.08 after a spokesperson said it was “fundamentally strong”.Broader markets trimmed losses as oil prices dropped more than $6. The moves helped consumer discretionary stocks to advance in spite of new data showing that retail sales barely budged in June despite the tailwind of massive government rebate stimulus.The consumer discretionary sector rose 0.3 per cent and led by the likes of Hasbro and General Motors which added 6 per cent to $37.05 and 4.9 per cent to $9.84 respectively. GM also said it would undertake a radical restructuring plan, boosting the stocks.Some deal news also lifted sentiment. Sprint Nextel shares surged 9.4 per cent to $9.04 after reports that South Korea’s SK Telecom was in talks to buy the wireless company.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent at 1,214.89 points – its lowest level since November 2005. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 10,961.80 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 2,215.71 points.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: ”It feels like the craziest day ever . . . The volatility index showed some real fear in the morning. But then oil sold off which calmed some people and brought buyers back into the market.”New data from the Labor Department showed that the cost of raw materials for producers continues to rise although core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel, moderated somewhat in June. Such costs are clearly taking their toll. Kimberly-Clark issued a profit warning blaming rising energy and distribution costs. The shares fell 6.5 per cent to $55.01.Eaton, the diversified engineering company, also declined 6.8 per cent to $74.47 after the company said 2008 profit would be lower than it previously projected because of rising oil prices. The industrials sector fell 1.8 per cent.Energy stocks were the biggest fallers, following oil prices lower. ExxonMobil dropped 3.8 per cent to $82.19, Chevron lost 3.6 per cent to $89.42 ConocoPhillips slid 4.1 per cent to $84.82. The sector has now lost 2.9 per cent over the year to date.Healthcare was the leading gainer and the only sector to hold positive territory consistently, climbing 1.3 per cent thanks to some decent earnings news from Johnson & Johnson and Genentech. The pair rose 1.9 per cent to $67.70 and 5.1 per cent to $79.25 respectively."
515;COP;Conocophillips;2008-07-09T18:42:43Z;It is their oil – western energy groups yield to state producers;;"Paolo Scaroni swivels round on the cream-coloured recliner towards his two fellow passengers on the Falcon 900 flying over the west coast of Sicily and says: “Now I will give you a short history lesson, if you don’t mind.” The chief executive of Eni, the Italian oil company, begins to summarise a century of Italy’s often fraught relationship with Libya.He explains that among the Libyans Italy exiled to the Tremiti islands during its occupation of the north African country that began in 1911 was the grandfather of one Shokri Ghanem. Mr Ghanem is the head of Libya’s national oil company and the man Mr Scaroni is on his way to see.That respectful awareness, along with the frequency with which he travels to see Mr Ghanem – 19 times last year alone – illustrates how the power relationships have shifted between the two men, between their countries and between international oil groups, such as Eni, and state entities such as Libya’s National Oil Corporation. As oil prices have risen to a record $140 a barrel, 14 times what they were a decade ago, oil- and gas-rich national energy companies have taken the driver’s seat and are exploiting their new-found power.Mr Scaroni and Mr Ghanem are meeting to sign perhaps the most important contract so far in Mr Scaroni’s three-year tenure at Eni. The deal sets out the new terms under which Eni will retain access to its most important oil patch, one it clung to for 44 years despite the threat of retaliatory US sanctions.Eni is the first of a list of companies, which also include Total of France and Spain’s Repsol, to have to renegotiate its contracts in Libya in order to give Tripoli a greater share of the profits of existing projects. In return, Eni and the other international oil companies will win the right to remain in one of the world’s pre-eminent oil and gas basins at a time when other petro-states are nationalising their fields or closing their doors to foreign oil companies.The two men joke that during the protracted negotiations they saw each other more often than their wives. But Mr Ghanem is a big fan of Mr Scaroni, whom he successfully nominated to become 2008’s petroleum executive of the year, an award to be presented in October at the annual Oil and Money Conference in London. He compares him with Enrico Mattei, Eni’s charismatic but controversial founder, who shook up the industry in the first half of the 20th century. By signing more generous deals with the poorer countries of the Middle East and the Soviet bloc, Mr Mattei broke the stranglehold the “seven sisters” – a phrase he coined to describe the main oil companies of the time, including Standard Oil – had over the industry.Sitting in his dimly lit conference room in Tripoli after signing the contracts last month, Mr Ghanem says: “Paolo has brought back the days of Enrico Mattei to Eni. Once again Eni is a major company.”But not everyone is happy with Mr Scaroni’s approach. Rival oil groups, many of which are descendants of the original seven sisters, are particularly concerned. In private, their executives say Mr Scaroni’s willingness to bend to national oil company demands makes it more difficult for others to stand their ground.In fact, Mr Scaroni even joked as he signed the Libyan deal that Mr Ghanem would use the new contract as a bargaining tool with other oil groups. “He is going to exploit the concessions he got from us as he negotiates with the other companies, because he plays the game to the end,” Mr Scaroni said.Analysts too are unsure whether Mr Scaroni is a visionary reaping the first-mover advantage of someone who has recognised that the industry has changed for good, or is giving away too much for too little gain. Neil McMahon, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, notes that Mr Scaroni – not unlike Mr Mattei – is more willing to bend than his peers because of necessity. “Eni are more desperate than Exxon for longer-term reserves as they have a smaller legacy position,” says Mr McMahon.The same could be said of Repsol. Antonio Brufau, its chairman and chief executive, says his strategy is closer to that of Mr Scaroni because those who move first have a better negotiating position than those at the end of the queue. “Being last is not going to change the picture, the fact that it will happen. Being first …at least you prove the will to adapt yourself.”Mr Scaroni simply counters his critics by saying: “I am not here to litigate with oil countries. It is their oil.”All around the world – from Kazakhstan to Alaska – oil-rich governments are reasserting that ownership as they squeeze international energy groups, raising taxes and royalties and taking a bigger share of projects. In Russia, the Kremlin has forced companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP and their peers to sell the majority share of their projects to Gazprom, the country’s state-controlled gas monopoly.In Venezuela, almost every big international oil company has had to give up part or all of its oilfields. Eni took Caracas to arbitration but quickly settled, agreeing to lose its Dacion field for compensation of at least $700m (£355m, €446m) and a chance to become involved in Venezuela’s heavy oil deposits in the Orinoco belt. ExxonMobil – seen as the strictest among its peers on sanctity of contract – is sticking to its guns and has taken Caracas all the way to the courts in the US, the Netherlands and the UK, antagonising the government of President Hugo Chávez in the process. “Eni has too few lawyers and Exxon has too many” is how one industry lawyer puts it.Kazakhstan’s Kashagan project, which Eni operates, is perhaps the starkest illustration of just how different the Italian oil company’s approach is from that of its peers. A consortium including Exxon, Total, Shell and ConocoPhillips has already invested $17bn in developing the Kashagan field, which when it hits peak production of 1.5m barrels a day some time in the middle of the next decade is projected to become one of the world’s three biggest.But over the past two years, the Kazakh government has escalated its demands on its foreign investors, eventually forcing the companies to reduce their stake in order to give Kazmunaigas, its national oil company, a larger share. The dispute pushed already slipping deadlines back even further and revealed acrimony not only between Kazakhstan and the companies but also among the foreign partners themselves. Rivals blame Eni for badly managing the project, which is seen as one of the industry’s toughest. Their executives say Eni promised the government too much, too quickly.Things turned so bad that Eni’s partners quietly began to lobby against the Italian company. They got their way late last year when the Kazakh government announced that Eni would lose its operatorship at the end of the primary phase of the project when the field comes on stream.Christ­ophe de Margerie, Total’s chief executive, says Exxon and Total long saw the earlier start-up dates as too optimistic. He adds that he is pleased Eni will not be running the second phase of the project on its own.But the tussle between oil companies and oil-rich nations has implications far wider than prompting infighting among the companies. Oil production growth is slipping as many national oil companies prove themselves ill-equipped to manage the industries of which they are increasingly in control. Often their governments use them as piggy banks rather than allowing them to reinvest their profits.In Venezuela, oil production has fallen steeply since the populist Mr Chávez took over. In Mexico, where politicians are again negotiating whether to give Pemex, the Mexican national oil company, more freedom to allow foreign companies to help, production is declining by more than 30 per cent a year at Cantarell, the country’s largest field. This not only threatens Mexico’s future national income but also buoys international oil prices. In Russia, the Kremlin’s power grab has also had dire consequences for what is the world’s ­second-largest oil producer: in the first quarter of this year the country suffered its first fall in production in a decade.Combined, these factors have led to stagnating oil production growth outside the Opec cartel. The International Energy Agency, the developed countries’ watchdog, forecasts in its latest medium-term outlook that, for the first time in the industry’s modern history, countries outside Opec will in the next five years hardly be able to increase production at all. Nobuo Tanaka, IEA executive director, last week called on non-Opec countries to grant companies greater access to their resources and create more transparent legal systems conducive to investment. He said: “The underground resource is still there; the problem is above ground.”The lack of growth means Opec’s share of the market is projected to rise from 40 per cent to 50-60 per cent, shifting money and influence from western countries to oil exporters in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. But even national oil companies within Opec are not investing as much as international oil companies. Exxon alone has a capital expenditure programme of $125bn over the next five years, 60 per cent of the $210bn that all 13 members of Opec combined intend to invest in the same period. This lack of investment means oil prices are generally forecast to stay high unless a recession drastically erodes demand in large parts of the world.In such a climate international oil companies, despite record profits, are struggling. Output will either remain flat or fall, while their reserves will probably shrink. That is a big problem for Mr Scaroni and his peers, whose success is judged by how much they can increase production and how well they do in finding the reserves that will yield the oil on which their companies’ future revenue depends.So it is no surprise that when asked, on the flight back from Tripoli, Mr Scaroni names growth as his single most important objective for Eni. And he has one more historical footnote, this time on the Republic of the Congo, where – in the quest to fulfil his ambitions for growth – Eni in April bought the right to exploit several oilfields. They include the first extra-heavy field that will come into production outside Canada’s tar sands and Venezuela’s Orinoco belt.Buoyed by his accomplishment in Tripoli, Mr Scaroni takes on a more competitive tone. He asks his fellow travellers where the capital of free France was in 1944. The answer is Brazzaville, a titbit Mr Scaroni picked up five years earlier in a biography of Charles de Gaulle. “When you have lunch with African presidents and other people you do business with, you can’t talk about oil the entire time,” he says.In the oil world, Congo-Brazzaville may not have the cachet of Libya. Nevertheless, Mr Scaroni is acutely aware of just how much his company, and the industry as a whole, now depend on the leaders of oil-rich nations. But whether his legacy will stand up to that of Mr Mattei, or whether he will be remembered as the man who gave away Eni’s riches, will become clear only long after he has retired from an industry where many projects now take a decade to complete."
516;COP;Conocophillips;2008-07-08T20:37:10Z;Wall Street rallies in late trade;;Wall Street stocks rallied the most in over a month on Tuesday, bouncing back from bear market territory as falling commodity prices boosted consumer facing stocks and financials roared ahead.Oil was the prime mover on Tuesday, falling about $6 a barrel and dropping below $137 a barrel.That retreat, and some new data showing that tax rebates continue to fuel spending helped consumer-facing stocks. Gap added 5.6 per cent to $16.75 and Ford rose 9.6 per cent to $4.90 while the consumer discretionary sector advanced 2.2 per cent.Office Depot, however, was a weak spot, dropping 31.6 per cent to $7.08 after it said North American same-store sales fell nearly 10 per cent in the second quarter and it warned on operating margins.Consumer staples also fared well, climbing 1.5 per cent. SuperValu rose 5 per cent to $32.67 while Wal-Mart rose 3.9 per cent to $59.11.Results from Pepsi Bottling Group took some of the shine off the sector, however. The company posted second-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations but investors were unimpressed, trimming the share price by 2.7 per cent to $27.88.Industrials and healthcare stocks also advanced, adding 0.7 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.An analyst upgrade boosted United Parcel Service 4.3 per cent to $60.40 while falling oil prices helped other transport-related stocks gain.GE climbed 3.5 per cent to $28.06, CSX advanced 6.9 per cent to $60.79 and Ryder System rose 4.4 per cent to $70.08.In healthcare sector, stocks rallied a day after S&P equity strategists upgraded the group to “market weight” arguing that with equity volatility likely to remain elevated and valuations low, “investors will re-focus on healthcare’s defensive qualities, allowing for better relative performance. ”Schering-Plough was among the leading gainers, climbing 4.6 per cent to $20.86 after it said its experimental treatment for infertility had met its main goals in a late-stage study.Biogen Idec and Abbott Laboratories gained 6.9 per cent to $62.94 and 5.9 per cent to $57.37 respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day up 1.7 per cent at 1,273.68. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent to 11,384.21 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3 per cent at 2,294.42. Both indices moved out of bear market territory.Financials stocks climbed sharply, adding 5.7 per cent for their biggest one day gain since early April. The Federal Reserve chairman suggested the central bank would give investment banks access to emergency cash into 2009 while the chief executive of JP Morgan said credit losses would ease.The news offered the sector some consolation after a volatile start to the week in which they re-tested five year lows.The most heavily sold stocks made the strongest advances. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Washington Mutual jumped, soaring 11.9 per cent to $17.62, 13 per cent to $13.64 and 16.8 per cent to $5.99 respectively.On Monday a wave of speculation that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government sponsored mortgage entities, might have to raise capital to retain their triple A credit ratings triggered heavy selling .In spite of Ben Bernanke’s soothing comments, there were some moments of excitement.IndyMac Bancorp provided the most spectacular of those, plummeting 38 per cent to $0.44. The California mortgage specialist said it did not have enough capital to offer new home loans and an analyst said shareholders may be wiped out.Energy stocks crumpled in response to the falling oil prices however. The sector fell 1.6 per cent and is now on the brink of a correction from its May highs, down about 9 per cent..Exxon Mobil fell 1.2 per cent to $85.94 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.3 per cent to $89.15.Still, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, warned: “It is a passing thing. I don’t think we are going to get a real break in energy prices until the fourth quarter when prices are seasonally weak and some Fed rate hikes take effect.”The materials sector fared little better, losing 0.6 per cent as commodity prices slipped back and investors worried that a global economic downturn would hurt demand. US Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $150.55 while Nucor lost 4.4 per cent to $63.16.
517;COP;Conocophillips;2008-07-08T18:45:38Z;Abu Dhabi set to exploit gas from Shah field;;State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and ConocoPhillips of the US on Tuesday signed a long-awaited deal to develop a mammoth onshore gas project.According to the interim engineering and design contract, Adnoc will take a 60 per cent stake in the Shah field, 180 km southwest of the city of Abu Dhabi, and ConocoPhillips will take 40 per cent.The aim is to process 1bn cubic feet daily of sour gas, the two parties said on Tuesday.The parties did not disclose the total project cost of the Shah field on Tuesday but development expenditure has previously been put at $10bn.Costs in the exploration and production industry have been spiralling as demand for labour and materials has risen with the price of oil.Sour gas, so-called because it contains large quantities of sulphur, is highly toxic and technically demanding to extract.The agreement to develop the Shah field paves the way for an easing of looming gas shortages in the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, has sizeable quantities of gas – the emirate is estimated to hold the fifth largest gas reserves in the world. But it exports much of its gas and has not developed the assets because of the cost and difficulty.Rapid urban and industrial development in Abu Dhabi and the other six emirates which make up the UAE, particularly Dubai, have eaten into the volumes of gas. Abu Dhabi imports gas from nearby Qatar, via the Dolphin pipeline.Royal Dutch Shell and Occidental had been viewed as frontrunners during the long negotiations but ConocoPhillips said earlier this year that it expected to be “working” on the project. The two sides said on Tuesday that “final project agreements are expected to be completed by year-end”.Analysts said on Tuesday that, even by the standards of tight-lipped Adnoc, the information disclosed on the agreement was unusually sparse. “This project has taken it to another level,” said Ross Cassidy, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based consultants.Mr Cassidy said the main challenge was dealing with the impurities that must be stripped out of the gas, which in turn have an impact on profitability of the deal.Aside from sulphur, Shah gas contains significant amounts of carbon dioxide which makes the gas acid and which, once separated, represents a sizeable environmental challenge.The technology to develop sour gas fields such as Shah has been used before in Canada and Kazakhstan, Mr Cassidy said, but the economics of Tuesday’s deal have yet to be tested.
518;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Exxon attacks Kazakh oilfield delays;;"ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest listed integrated energy group, on Tuesday blamed the government of Kazakhstan for delaying the development of the world’s biggest new oilfield, significantly raising the level of acrimony surrounding the troubled project.Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive, barely contained his anger as he warned the Kazakh government to stop delaying the development of the field, into which he said a consortium of the world’s biggest energy companies had already invested $17bn (€10.8bn, £8.5bn) but which has yet to produce a barrel of oil or a dollar of revenue.He said: “It is time for the government of Kazakhstan to stop delaying the project, [to] be supportive of the consortium and see the project through to a successful start-up.”Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of Total – which is also in the consortium with Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips among others – said that he agreed with Mr Tillerson and that Exxon and Total had long believed that earlier start-up dates had been far too optimistic.However, the usually blunt Mr de Margerie sounded uncharacteristically diplomatic in comparison with his US counterpart.Previous tensions surrounding the Kashagan project have stayed behind closed doors as oil executives are generally loathe to antagonise governments on whom they depend for access to oil reserves.Kashagan, which at its peak is expected to pump 1.5m barrels of oil a day, so becoming one of the world’s three largest fields, is now expected to start operations in 2013, two years later than previous forecasts and eight years later than the initial target of 2005.The field, which lies in the shallow waters of the Caspian Sea, is a huge technical challenge because of floating ice, high reservoir pressure, lethal levels of hydrogen sulphide gas and the environmental sensitivities surrounding native sturgeon and other species.How an industry can develop the field when its costs are escalating and supplies of labour and equipment are tight has been a large issue of contention among both the partners in the project and between the oil companies and the Kazakh government.But the relationship became even more strained when Kazakhstan began to demand a bigger slice of the partnership, insisting that Kazmunaigas, its national oil company, joined the group and then raised its share by forcing the other companies to take a smaller stake. Meanwhile, following the trend of oil-rich states demanding a greater share of the profits that come with $140-a-barrel oil prices, the government has also toughened its contract terms.Last year relations between the two sides hit a nadir when the government stripped Eni of its operating licence for the second phase of the project, which will begin with the start of production. And earlier this week Sauat Mynbayev, Kazakhstan’s energy minister, announced strict new sanctions if deadlines slipped
further."
519;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-30T23:13:07Z;Energy: Oil lubricates high-level links;;"When Kazakhstan’s giant Kashagan oil field was found in 2000, it was the biggest in decades. Few thought then that the Caspian field could be the last such discovery.But even the discovery of large deposits off Brazil, which caused huge excitement in the industry last year, fails to match the oil wealth of Kashagan, the largest oil field outside the Middle East with 13bn barrels of recoverable reserves.This has led to the belief among oil executives and analysts that there may be no more Kashagans to be found south of the Arctic Circle.But for all its hydrocarbon riches, Kashagan comes with some serious drawbacks. The field has suffered one delay after another. That has hit Kazakh­stan’s relationship with some of the world’s biggest oil companies – including Italy’s Eni, Exxon ­Mobil and ConocoPhillips of the US, France’s Total, and Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell.Kashagan is not the nation’s only field. The projects of Tengiz, Karachaganak, CNPC-Aktobemunaigas, Uzenmunaigas, Mandistaumunaigas and Kumokol already produce 1m barrels a day of liquids, or 70 per cent of the country’s total, with the rest made up by smaller fields.Other prospects include Khumangazy, near the Russian border, Zhemchuzina, in which Royal Dutch Shell has a large stake, and Kalamkas, discovered in 2001 by Eni.Together, they help bring Kazakhstan’s proven hydrocarbon reserves to as much as 40bn barrels. The Energy Information Administration, the US Department of Energy’s statistical arm, points out that Kazakhstan’s reserves are, in size, between those of Opec’s two North African members, Algeria and Libya.Kazakhstan’s petroleum industry already accounts for more than half its export revenues and about 30 per cent of gross domestic product, which has averaged an impressive 9 per cent growth since 2002.But Kashagan is Kazakhstan’s most important project and one that will enhance the position of the country, situated between the huge markets of Europe and Asia, as one of the world’s most important oil exporters.At its peak, Kashagan is expected to pump 1.5m barrels a day, almost certainly putting it in the world’s top three when it eventually comes onstream. But that date has been pushed further and further into the future, initially from 2005 to 2008, then to 2011 and now possibly as far off as 2013. All that time, costs have been rising.Early expectations were far too optimistic, but later date changes came as Eni, the field’s operator, had to admit that technical challenges – such as the high pressure and deadly hydrogen sulphide content of the field – were far tougher than it had thought.Additional reasons for the delays include infighting among the international oil companies and Kazakhstan’s insistence that the group give Kazmunaigas, Kazakhstan’s national oil company, a share of the field.This led to a nadir last year – Kazakhstan decided to strip Eni of its operatorship once the field moves into production and negotiate a new operating agreement with the consortium.Kazakhstan has also become tougher elsewhere, tightening its grip on the industry and demanding a higher share of the profit, as benchmark oil prices have risen to a record $140 a barrel, 14 times those of a decade ago and twice as high as last year.Irene Molodtsov, managing director of Molten, a consulting firm, says: “The biggest need we have found among international joint-ventures with Kazakhstan has been aligning the diverse cultures and processes of the groups involved.” This has been exacerbated by difficulties in obtaining visas, uncertainty surrounding government intentions and the challenge of attracting people to remote locations that are even less developed than, for example, Sakhalin, the oil- and gas-rich island off Russia’s Pacific coast.Kazakhstan’s decision to change the rules of the game has yet to reach the levels exhibited by its powerful neighbour to the north. In its attempt to take back control of its most precious resources, Russia dismantled Yukos, its most promising independent oil company; played hardball with Royal Dutch Shell in Sakhalin and appears to be making similar moves on TNK-BP.In so doing, Russia has scared Europe, its biggest customer, into seeking alternative sources of oil, natural gas and the pipelines that carry them. China has also looked for other suppliers.That has benefited Kazakhstan. The country already exports oil via every compass point. Some goes through the Black Sea, via Russia, some through the Persian Gulf, via swaps with Iran, some to the north via Russia by rail, and some to the east via pipelines to China.Kazakhstan is already expanding this network, adding capacity, upgrading old pipelines, linking to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, and extending its transport system to China.This will increase its importance in the region and to the US, Asia and Europe. It will also allow it to maintain a presence on the international stage, despite concerns by governments and human rights groups about its democratic credentials and its leader’s past, which included allegations – denied by President Nursultan Nazarbayev – of misappropriation of oil funds set to be tried in the Southern District of New York.It is unclear whether the next US president – due to take office on January 20 – will be as welcoming as the Bushes, senior and junior, who both invited Mr Nazarbayev to the White House. But his country’s oil wealth means that whoever takes over the world’s most powerful office will not be able to ignore him."
520;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-30T18:03:14Z;Wall Street ends month on dismal note;;New York stocks bounced back modestly on Monday as soaring oil prices boosted energy stocks but the rally was too little, too late to prevent the S&P 500 from registering its worst month since September 2002.The relentless rise in oil prices has been the scourge of stock markets this month, undercutting investor confidence with the threat of inflation and turning modest gains in April and May into significant losses in June.Oil, which hit $143 a barrel in early trading before easing back, took its toll on consumer-facing stocks again on Monday.Expedia which was also knocked by a price target cut from Citigroup, fell back 3.4 per cent to $18.51, while Hasbro also lost 1.3 per cent to $35.59. Ford and General Motorswere also hard hit tumbling 4.8 per cent to $4.74 and 3.5 per cent to $11.13 respectively. The consumer discretionary sector gave up 0.4 per cent.Gains for oil producers however helped broader indices advance. Exxon Mobiland Conoco­Phillips added 1.1 per cent to $87.52 and 2.5 per cent to $94.13 respectively, while the sector climbed 1.6 per cent.The positive momentum was reinforced after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its measure of business activity in the Midwest improved in June, calming fears that output would collapse as the slowdown takes its toll.Industrials rallied 0.7 per cent on the news. UPS added 1.7 per cent to $61.38 and Cummins climbed 2.8 per cent to $66.16.Strength in the telecommunications and healthcare sectors, which added 3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, helped offset further weakness in financials. The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day 0.1 per cent ahead at 1,280 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat at 11,350.01. The Nasdaq Composite fell back 1 per cent to 2,292.98Last week, surging oil prices, poor earnings reports from the technology sector and a slump in financials pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Index into bear market territory and the S&P 500 to within a hair’s breadth of its March lows.That pattern was repeated yesterday. The Dow fell to its lowest level since September 2006 – down more than 20 per cent from its October highs – before recovering. The index is down 7.2 per cent over the quarter and 10 per cent so far this month – its worst June performance since the Great Depression.The S&P 500 fared little better. Technical analysts had warned that if the index broke through its March lows, it could retest its 2002 depths, but the recent bottom held. However, the index is still down 8.4 per cent over the month so far and 3 per cent over the quarter.One bright spot yesterday morning though was better-than-expected results from H&R Block. The US tax preparer reported its first quarterly profit in two years, thanks to the sale of its loan servicing unit. H&R rose 3.2 per cent to $21.49.Campbell Soup also cheered investors with news that it plans to buy back up to $1.2bn of stock by 2011. The shares climbed 5.2 per cent to $33.86.Analysts expect second quarter earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole to decline 11.3 per cent – marking the first time that the index has recorded four consecutive quarters of negative growth since 2002. At the start of the year, analysts were forecasting growth of 4.7 per cent.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, says that, even with those revisions, full-year earnings predictions are too high as tighter credit conditions will have an impact on industrial activity.Telecoms were the leading gainers on the S&P 500. Sprint Nextel led the pack, adding 4.9 per cent to $9.35 after reports that its Instinct phone was proving popular. Verizon rose 2.5 per cent to $35.13, while AT&T gained 1.3 per cent to $33.19.The travails of the financial sector continued to weigh on sentiment. Bond insurer MBIA was among the biggest fallers, dropping 8.9 per cent to $3.80 after a report that it is selling municipal bonds to raise cash. Peer Ambac slumped 22.4 per cent to $1.25.Wachovia was the worst performing bank, dropping 4.9 per cent to $15.43 after analysts said it might cut its dividend.
521;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-29T15:35:18Z;Fresh Kashagan oil delay sparks anger;;Production at Kashagan, one of the world’s biggest oilfields, has been postponed by two years to 2013, Kazakhstan said at the weekend. It warned that new setbacks, blamed on rising costs, would lead to severe penalties for the western consortium developing the Caspian Sea project.A memorandum of understanding signed by the government and the Eni-led consortium builds on a framework agreement from January, when investors pledged to compensate Kazakhstan for late production and ballooning costs at Kashagan and committed to start production by late 2010 The consortium includes Shell, Exxon Mobil, Total, ConocoPhillips, KazMunaiGas and Japan’s Inpex Holdings.“In addition to important adjustments to economic terms, the new agreement also provides the republic of Kazakhstan with substantial assurances that the project will be implemented in accordance with the approved schedule,” KazMunaiGas, Kazakhstan’s state oil company, said.Sauat Mynbaev, energy minister, said if production was delayed beyond 2013, the Eni group would lose the right to defer royalties payments until after the recovery of development costs.“They have already invested $17bn (€11bn, £9bn) and this money will be refunded in [future] oil production. But if they continue to spend money beyond October 1 2013, the sum will not be refunded in oil. It will be purely their loss,” Mr Mynbaev said. “We think this is the last time there will be a delay.”Julia Nanay, a senior director at PFC Energy, said: “This is a memo of understanding, not a watertight agreement. There are likely to be more, complex negotiations before the Kashagan terms are laid in stone.”When Eni signed the Kashagan contract in 2000 it said production would begin in 2005 and build to 1.5m barrels a day. The field lies at the core of Kazakhstan’s plan to double oil production and enter the ranks of the world’s top oil exporters.The government is becoming more demanding of foreign investors in the country’s resources. Tough terms for oil and mining contracts will oblige them to support downstream projects to help the country diversify its economy, a senior official said.“If you would like to invest in Kazakhstan, you must first pay tax, second, follow the environmental agenda and third, bring something value-added,” Kairat Kelimbetov, presidential administration head, told the Financial Times.
522;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-23T20:41:00Z;Oil groups defy flat mood on Wall Street;;"US stock markets fluttered around the unchanged mark on Monday as rising oil prices lifted energy companies but hurt consumer-facing stocks while more analyst
downgrades weighed on the financial sector.Oil rose about $2, helping all 39 members of the S&P 500 energy sector to advance.ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil added 3 per cent to $95.54 and 3.3 per cent to $87.70, respectively, and the sector gained 3.7 per cent as a whole.As the second-quarter earnings season gains momentum, analysts have high expectations of the energy sector, predicting earnings growth of about 23 per cent. That would represent the third consecutive quarter of at least 20 per cent growth for the sector.That strength has come at the expense of oil-dependent companies and has also hit consumer-facing stocks. Investors worry that rising fuel costs will cut into disposable incomes, limiting spending on non-essentials.On Monday, the consumer discretionary and staple sectors fell back as oil advanced, dropping 1.6 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively.Even some deal news from the agriculture and waste management sectors could do little to improve market sentiment.Bunge, the oilseed processor, agreed to buy Corn Products International for $4.4bn in stock. Bunge fell 9.4 per cent to $110.70, while Corn Products jumped 18.3 per cent to $50.75.Meanwhile, Republic Services said it would buy rival waste-removal company Allied Waste Industries for $6.1bn in stock, concluding nearly two years’ worth of discussions. Allied fell 2 per cent to $13.29. Republic slipped 0.7 per cent to $31.29The benchmark S&P 500 closed roughly flat at 1,318.01 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average held steady at 11,842.36. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.9 per cent to 2,385.28.Last week, US stock markets slumped to their worst levels since March on the back of weak housing and manufacturing data and a flurry of downgrades and announcements from the beaten down banking sector.Analysts at Thomson Reuters said: “There hasn’t been a back-to-back weekly advance in the DJIA since the May 2nd week and . . . investor confidence is under duress with market technicians making unabashed calls for a 9,400 Dow and 965 S&P.”While many would see those predictions as too pessimistic, the leading indices are likely to come under pressure as the second-quarter earnings season progresses. This week, 16 S&P 500 groups announce quarterly earnings.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&P Equity Research, said: “You could say that we are in a period of range-bound optimism: optimism that the 1,270 [S&P 500 March] lows were the lows for this corrective action but range-bound until we get a better handle on earnings growth, energy prices and on what the Fed might be doing next.”With little in the way of economic data released on Monday, markets took their cues from the usual suspects – oil and financials.Carmakers were among the leading fallers in the consumer discretionary
sector. Fordlost 9.1 per cent to $5.28 while General Motors slipped 6.4 per cent to $12.91.In the consumer staples sector, Supervalu fell 4 per cent to $30.44. Walgreen the US drugstore chain, also lost ground, dropping 1.1 per cent to $34.70 after reporting a smaller-than-expected increase in third-quarter profit.Financials were the biggest drag on the S&P 500, however, dropping 2.7 per cent and setting new lows for the year.Lehman Brothers fell 5.8 per cent to $22.80, Bank of America dropped 4.5 per cent to $25.88, JPMorgan lost 2.6 per cent to $36.87 after a number of analysts cut their earnings forecasts and ratings for the industry. Goldman Sachs, for example, recommended selling financials, admitting that its May upgrade of the industry was “clearly wrong”.In other corporate news, US Steel rose 4.5 per cent to $191.02 after Goldman Sachs added the company to its “conviction buy” list.According to analysts at Barclays Capital, sentiment is likely to be muted prior to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which starts on Tuesday.The US central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold."
523;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ITV creative chief faces challenges;;Will Lee Bartlett, the Californian anointed as king of ITV’s creative wing and overseeing programmes from Coronation Street to The Royle Family, have time to acclimatise to his new realm before commercial pressures contrive to sully his reign?With a share price that hit another all-time low of 50½p on Friday, Mr Bartlett has a statistic other than ratings by which to judge his success, but he recognises that the need above anything else is to understand the product he is selling.He told colleagues that while familiarising himself with DVDs of ITV Productions’ best-known shows, he had “to watch a few of the Coronation Street episodes more than once since I was unfamiliar with the Manchester accent”.But he quickly became hooked. The only problem is that he has 47 years of back catalogue to catch up with.Michael Grade, ITV’s executive chairman, elevated Mr Bartlett to succeed Dawn Airey, the woman who had just poached him from Fox in Los Angeles, after she shocked the company by defecting to RTL’s UK channel Five last month.He admits he is on a “steep learning curve”. “I am really enjoying my time here, and it’s been quite an interesting ride, to put it mildly,” he says. “I’d be the first to say I am not steeped in British TV …but I have an amazing team here in ITV Productions, led by John Whiston, who certainly are.”Mr Bartlett is also something of an Anglophile, having lived in London quarter of a century ago when, after graduating from law school, he worked for Phillips Petroleum. His daughter Marike was born in the UK and has dual citizenship.As managing director of global content, he oversees ITV Productions, maker of Coronation Street and Emmerdale, as well as the sales of home-produced programmes round the world.It is here that Mr Bartlett sees the greatest opportunities for growth and that is particularly important for him, as Mr Grade made his division key to his whole turnround plan in 2007, charged with doubling revenues to £1.2bn by 2010.Whereas Ms Airey’s first move was to pay top-dollar to buy in growth, acquiring 12 Yard, the independent production company, Mr Bartlett has signed a co-operation and development deal with his old buddies at Twentieth Century Fox TV, the scripted-programmes arm of Fox. The arrangement will cost relatively little, but offers the prospect of external sales.“This deal is not to produce solely for ITV. I would sell to, say, Sky just as easily,” he says. “I would sell to anyone that wishes to buy.”At least one analyst had questioned how Mr Bartlett, whose experience is in the business affairs side of television as much as production, would handle the crucial relationship with ITV’s director of television Peter Fincham, who has extensive production experience as the owner of his own company, Talkback.Mr Bartlett is, unsurprisingly, positive: “Peter and I have an extremely good relationship because, with my experience, I see the point of view of the broadcaster and the scheduler, while with his, he sees the point of view of the programme maker. That is a very nice mix.”ITV’s shares closed at 50.6p, down 1.75 per cent, valuing the company’s equity at £2bn.
524;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-19T20:47:02Z;Wall St rebounds after drop in oil prices;;Wall Street stock markets rebounded on Thursday after a drop in oil prices buoyed consumer discretionary and transport stocks, taking the sting out of data showing continued weakness in the US economy and a warning from Citigroup about further writedowns.The day began in a downbeat fashion with new data that showed initial jobless claims dropped by less than expected last week, while manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region contracted more than expected in June.Still, it was the travails of the banking sector that weighed heaviest on equity markets in early trading. Comments from the chief financial officer of Citigroup accelerated losses.Gary Crittenden told investors that the largest US bank would have substantial writedowns on its holdings of subprime mortgage-related debt. Citigroup shares slid as much as 4.9 per cent before recovering to $20.17, down 1.3 per cent.As oil prices fell back however, a rally in the consumer discretionary and industrial sectors picked up steam, and they advanced 1.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively erasing early losses.Amid the broad market rally, even financials ended the day in positive territory, adding 0.9 per cent alongside a 1.2 per cent gain for technology.By the close S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent at 1,342.83 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly dipped below 12,000 points for the second successive day, before reviving. The index ended the day 0.3 per cent higher at 12,063.09 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 per cent to 2,446.99 points.On Wednesday, equity markets sold off sharply, and the Dow hit a three-month low, after declines in the banking sector and a downbeat outlook on the economy from FedEx weighed on sentiment.The pattern initially repeated on Thursday after analysts cut their earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley, triggering a sell-off. Morgan Stanley shares, which struggled to a small gain on Wednesday, fell 1.2 per cent to $40.19.Regional banks have come under particular selling pressure in the past few days as a number of analysts have questioned the ability of smaller, less capitalised banks to stand up to the strains of the credit crisis and mounting losses on mortgage assets.But they also found some positive momentum on Thursday, adding to their gains after BB&T said that it would increase its dividend, dismissing an analyst’s prediction that the North Carolina bank would do just the opposite. BB&T overturned early losses to climb 0.1 per cent to $24.35, while Fifth Third recovered 5.3 per cent to $9.75.Industrials proved robust, as transport stocks helped them shake off the poor macroeconomic data.A number of rail companies have given warnings that flooding in the Midwest of the US will dent earnings, most recently Burlington Northern Santa Fe, but analysts and investors remain positive over the long-term outlook for the sector.Burlington shares added 2.3 per cent to $105.55 while peers Union Pacific and CSX climbed 2.6 per cent to $77.80 and 3.3 per cent to $66.34 respectively.In earnings news, Circuit City Stores, the electronics retailer that put itself up for sale last month, disappointed investors by reporting a loss of $164.8m and revenue down 7.4 per cent to $2.3bn. Circuit shares fell 1.7 per cent to $3.98.Better than expected second-quarter results from Carnival, the cruise line company, a rally in oversold stocks in the staples sector and a $5 drop in oil prices helped keep consumer-facing stocks well above water.Carnival rose 5.4 per cent to $36.84 and Tyson Foods added 5.8 per cent to $14.47.Technology stocks were among the biggest gainers, benefiting from tumbling oil prices, which may ease strains on global economic growth. Microsoft rose 1.7 per cent to $28.93, Intel 2.6 per cent $22.85 and IBM 0.7 per cent to $125.02.Broadcom, the maker of chips for Nintendo’s Wii video-game console, rose 7.6 per cent to $27.22 after analysts at Lehman Brothers said second-quarter earnings will get a boost off higher demand.Energy was the only sector to close in the red.ExxonMobil dropped 2.3 per cent to $85.79 while ConocoPhillips fell 1.6 per cent to $93.66.
525;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-19T01:40:06Z;Energy from industry could halve gas imports;;Industries across the UK could generate as much electricity as 10 nuclear power stations and halve gas imports by installing or extending plants that generate energy while using the waste heat to warm local buildings.A report by Pöyry Energy Consulting, commissioned by Greenpeace, analysing the UK’s potential for combined heat and power units – which capture the heat from the electricity generation process and recycle it – found nine sites where CHP could be applied or extended.These include the ConocoPhillips and Total refineries on the Humber estuary, which is already the site of one of the biggest CHP units in Europe. It could be extended from its current capacity of 730MW of electricity to produce another 2,550MW, the report found.Other sites include the Petroplus refinery at Coryton, chemical and manufacturing facilities at Wilton on Teesside, the Stanlow manufacturing complex at Ellesmere Port, the Ineos refinery and chemical plant at Grangemouth and the ExxonMobil refinery at Fawley.If all of these were developed, UK industry could produce 16GW of electricity – the equivalent of building 10 nuclear power stations, and enough electricity to power two-thirds of the country’s households. Using the waste heat by pumping it to local buildings would also mean the UK would need to import only half as much gas as it does now.Tim Warham, principal consultant at Pöyry, said: “We were surprised at the large technical potential for industrial CHP we encountered. Provided the policy framework is right, CHP could make a huge contribution to securing power supplies for the UK.”Businesses installing or extending combined heat and power units could also save £1bn ($2bn, €1.2bn) a year on their energy bills, according to a Greenpeace estimate based on the report, and could profit by selling excess electricity and recycling their waste heat.The amount of CHP generated in the UK has nearly doubled in the past decade, from 3.68GW in 1998 to 5.55GW in 2006.But Graham Meeks, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association, said the government could do more: “Without effective and enduring incentives to make these investments, our next generation of power stations will simply replicate the failings of the past and continue with a needless waste of valuable heat.”
526;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-12T20:42:38Z;Wall St gains trimmed by oil rally;;"Wall Street stocks bounced back on Thursday as investors cheered takeover bid news and some better-than-expected retail sales data, but a late rally in oil prices pared gains at the close.In a largely positive day of trading the mood was barely dented by news that Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, had replaced Erin Callan and Joseph Gregory, its chief financial and chief operating officers, respectively.On Monday, Lehman spooked markets by pre-announcing a second-quarter loss and raising $6bn to help it survive the credit crunch. Its share price has been under siege ever since and has lost over 30 per cent of its value in the past week.Lehman shares fell 4.4 per cent to $22.70 but the news proved cathartic for the broader financials sector, which rallied as much as 3.6 per cent before falling back slightly to close 2 per cent higher.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 0.3 per cent higher at 1,339.87 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent at 12,141.58. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,404.35.Wall Street had fallen sharply on Wednesday as financials resumed their relentless downward path and technology stocks came under selling pressure after a key industry group cut its sales outlook for semiconductors.Thursday, however, began in upbeat fashion after InBev, the Belgian brewer, said it had offered $46.3bn in cash for Anheuser-Busch. InBev plans to fund the unsolicited bid with $40bn of debt, highlighting that bank financing remains available for the right deals.Anheuser jumped 5.2 per cent to $61.40 and the news lifted the consumer staples sector 0.6 per cent.Consumer-facing stocks more generally received a boost from a dip in oil prices and the latest retail sales data for May. According to the Commerce Department last month, retail sales rose twice as fast as forecast, spurred on by tax rebates.At present, consumer spending remains weak but has not entirely capitulated, thanks in part to the rebate cheques – a key part of President George W. Bush’s economic stimulus package.Among retailers, Office Depot rose 5.5 per cent to $12.53, Limited Brands added 3.3 per cent to $17.72 and Kohl’s gained 3 per cent to $43.88. The consumer discretionary sector advanced
0.7 per cent.Still, observers warned that the stimulus from the rebate cheques would not last forever.Lehman Brothers analysts said: “We expect the rebate to boost spending over the next few months. But we expect it to be temporary, acting like a shot of caffeine by boosting growth in the third quarter but pushing growth to negative territory in the fourth quarter as the caffeine kick fades.”Moreover, the macroeconomic news was not all good and gains were limited by a bump in the number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits.But it was the unlikely rebound in the banking sector that hogged the spotlight. Citigroup rallied 3.5 per cent to $19.89, JPMorgan added 2.4 per cent to $38.01 and Bank of America rose 2.1 per cent to $29.44. An index of investment banking stocks gained 2 per cent.Earlier in the day, strategists at Morgan Stanley upgraded financial stocks from underweight to neutral, arguing that lower interest rates and a correction in property prices had improved fundamental conditions, while banks were deleveraging.KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, was the exception, slumping 23.7 per cent to $11.98 after the bank said it would cut its dividend and raise $1.5bn after losing a tax case that will result in a second-quarter charge of as much as $1.2bn.Technology stocks were in focus on Thursday after Yahoo said it had ended all talks with Microsoft. Yahoo shares plunged 9.8 per cent to $23.59 but the sector held its ground as Microsoft advanced 4.1 per cent and Google popped 1.4 per cent to $552.95 on speculation it would step in and partner with Yahoo.In industrials, Cummins, the maker of heavy-duty truck engines, stood out, soaring 9.9 per cent to $69.38 after rival Caterpillar said it would pull out of a key market segment.Energy was one of the few sectors to cede ground, falling 1.8 per cent in spite of the rise in oil prices. ExxonMobil fell 1.2 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.7 per cent to $92.49."
527;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-11T20:40:57Z;Wall St falls led by financials;;Wall Street fell sharply on Wednesday as financials resumed their relentless downward path and technology stocks came under heavy selling pressure after a key industry group cut its sales outlook for semi­conductors.In the background, oil prices jumped more than $5 a barrel, taking the momentum out of Tuesday’s shallow rally in consumer-facing shares. The consumer discretionary sector fell 2.2 per cent while the homebuilder sub-sector fell 8 per cent to within touching distance of a seven-year low.The leading fallers, however, were financial stocks, which dropped 3.3 per cent, giving up recent fragile gains and suggesting that the sector has yet to find a solid bottom amid a steady trickle of bad news.Technology stocks followed close behind, slipping 2.4 per cent after the Semiconductor Industry Association said sales will grow less rapidly than expected this year as competition drives down prices, particularly for memory chips.Nine of the 10 leading industry sectors were in the red, dragging the S&P 500 index down 1.7 per cent to 1,335.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.7 per cent to 12,083.69. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2 per cent to 2,394.01.The tone on Wall Street has perceptibly darkened over the past few weeks as investors cope with bad news from financials and look ahead to rising inflation, weak consumer spending and a prolonged period of depressed earnings.While the S&P 500 posted monthly gains of 1.1 per cent and 4.8 per cent in April and May, so far in June the benchmark index is down 4.6 per cent.Scott Armiger, a vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust, said: “We were thinking that you would see some signs of expansion in the second half, and now it seems that it is going to be a long, hot summer and perhaps we won’t start to recover until next year.”Financials reprised their role as the villains of the piece on Wednesday and have fallen in all but two sessions in June. The sector is down 23.8 per cent this year.Washington Mutual, First Horizon and Huntington Bancshares fell 9.3 per cent to $6.06, 6 per cent to $8.27 and 6.5 per cent to $6.92 respectively. The banks have some of the highest exposures to home equity loans, which some analysts see as the next front in the ongoing credit crisis.Investment banks also took a beating as Lehman Brothers fell a 13.6 per cent to $23.75, dragging the sector down 5.3 per cent. It was followed by Merrill Lynch, down 6.6 per cent to $35.46. Matthew Albrecht, an equity analyst with S&P, said: “Preliminary results from Lehman Brothers should remind investors that this group is not out of the woods regarding mortgage and bridge loan exposure, and risk governance remains in focus.”Industrials came under pressure after UBS rated Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railway company, a “short-term sell”, suggesting rising fuel prices may impact second-quarter earnings. Burlington dropped 7 per cent to $103.77, dragging down peers Union Pacific and CSX, which slipped 5.7 per cent to $74.10 and 4 per cent to $63.60 respectively. CSX is in the middle of a messy proxy battle with British hedge fund The Children’s Investment Fund.Energy stocks were the sole gainers amid the broader malaise, following oil prices higher. ExxonÂ­Mobil rose 0.8 per cent to $88.61 and ConocoPhillips added 1.3 per cent to $94.08.Materials stocks fell in spite of some positive momentum for gold focused shares. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, for example, rose 0.6 per cent to $120.09.Gains for the broader sector were swamped, however, after JPMorgan downgraded Alcoa from “overweight” to “neutral”, suggesting that the aluminium producer would likely not be a take­over target. Alcoa dropped 8 per cent to $39.32.In technology, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel were among the leading fallers, losing 6.3 per cent to $6.96 and 3.8 per cent to $21.81 respectively.Amerigroup, the managed healthcare provider, fell 14.1 per cent to $23.36. It suspended its annual profit forecast as higher-than-expected claims forced it to renegotiate rates with the state of Tennessee.Meanwhile, Staples succeeded in its efforts to buy Corporate Express, a Dutch peer, with a revised $2.7bn offer. Staples shares rose 5.3 per cent to $24.38.
528;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-10T20:39:48Z;Rally in financials brings relief on Wall St;;Wall Street was mixed on Tuesday as a relief rally in financials helped investors to shake off hints about possible rate rises from the chairman of the Fed and a slump in energy stocks.Markets traditionally focus on the outlook for interest rates, and concerns that any rate rises would curtail whatever slow growth the economy was still generating initially knocked stocks.But analysts said that with record oil prices eating away at purchasing power and corporate profits, any moves to address those issues would be more helpful than harmful.Scott Armiger, a vice president at Christiana Bank & Trust, said: “Nudging rates up will drive down oil prices and do more for the consumer than keeping rates low.”The S&P 500 had pared losses by mid-afternoon after bouncing off technical support levels, while the Dow Jones had struggled into positive territory.The downtrodden financials sector lead the way, recovering 1.1 per cent as the most heavily sold stocks rallied off multi-year lows, while four of the 10 leading industrial groups made ground.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,358.39 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent higher at 12,289.36 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.4 per cent to 2,448.94 points.On Monday, equity markets rebounded meekly from last week’s dramatic sell-off. In a bumpy session of trading, analyst upgrades buoyed the energy sector, offsetting another poor session for financials.That pattern reversed itself yesterday as gains for the dollar dented oil and commodity prices while concerns about windfall taxes on producers also circulated.he energy sector gave up 2.2 per cent, the biggest one day fall since the end of April, while materials lost 1.3 per cent.ExxonMobil fell 1.3 per cent to $87.89. ConocoPhillips lost 2.5 per cent to $92.87 and Smith International eased 3.8 per cent to $80.28.XTO fell 1 per cent to $67.02 after it agreed to buy Hunt Petroleum for about $4.2bn in cash and shares.The banking sector also surprised investors, rising in spite of comments by Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, that added the prospect of higher borrowing costs for consumers and corporations to the list of significant problems facing the industry.Citigroup helped lead the way after Vikram Pandit, its chief executive, told a banking conference in London that liquidity at financial services companies and banks was returning to normal levels after the turmoil caused by the collapse of credit markets last year.Citigroup rose 3.4 per cent to $20.26, JPMorgan added 2.1 per cent to $38.29 and AIG climbed 2.4 per cent to $34.28.The leading gainers were Washington Mutual and National City. The former recovered from a 16-year low while the latter climbed after it said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with regulators over capital, risk and liquidity management.WaMu added 6.9 per cent to $6.68 and National City rose 3.8 per cent to $4.64.Conversely, Lehman Brothers remained in the doghouse after several analysts cut earnings estimates and stock ratings on the back of unexpected second quarter losses. Lehman shares fell 6.7 per cent to $27.50.The technology sector pared losses as investors digested the significance of Apple‘s new, cheaper iPhone.Apple shares, which were a drag on the sector on Monday, added 2.2 per cent to $185.64.Consumer-facing stocks moved higher thanks to better sales data. According to the International Council of Shopping Centres, chain store sales rose 1.7 per cent for the week ending June 7. The ICSC pointed to the federal stimulus cheques that were finally beginning to make an impact on retailers. For June as a whole, ICSC Research expects same-store sales to increase as much as 3 per cent.Gap shares rose 4.1 per cent to $17.69 while TJX, owner of TJ Maxx, added 2.8 per cent to $32.29 and the sector climbed 0.4 per cent.Consumer staples rose 0.9 per cent, led by Coca-Cola, which added 3.9 per cent to $58.01 after Deutsche Bank analysts upgraded the stock.Pepsi followed close behind, climbing 3.4 per cent to $67.58, while Kellogg also rose 3.4 per cent to $52.01.
529;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-09T21:40:39Z;Gazprom seeks acquisitions for toehold in US;;Gazprom is looking to make its first acquisition in the US as part of its move to enter the North American market.Vitaly Vasiliev, chief executive of Gazprom Marketing & Trading, the downstream arm of the state-controlled Russian gas company, told the Financial Times a takeover was one of the options under consideration for building Gazprom’s presence in the US market, where it hopes to sell increasing volumes of liquefied natural gas.He said: “We can build organically, we can do it with a partnership to build an outlet for us in the US or the third option would be acquisition”.He hopes to decide which route to take by the end of the year.A takeover of a US energy business by Gazprom, majority-owned by the Russian government, could be controversial.Foreign takeovers of US energy companies can be politically explosive, as was demonstrated in 2005 when CNOOC, the Chinese oil company, unsuccessfully attempted to acquire Unocal of California for nearly $20bn amid a congressional uproar.Gazprom is likely to face less rigorous scrutiny given that its plans for a toehold in the US appear fairly small-scale and do not involve the purchase of a large upstream US oil producer.GM&T has 8 per cent of the wholesale market in the UK after making small acquisitions of gas suppliers and it is considering a similar model for the US.Last month, GM&T signed a deal to join in an LNG regasification project in Canada, taking a stake and making a long-term commitment to use the import capacity. GM&T hopes to use the terminal for gas from Shtokman, the vast field off northern Russia that Gazprom is looking at developing with Total of France and StatoilHydro of Norway. It plans to start production in 2014.Gazprom has no LNG of its own yet but is trading a few cargoes a year to build expertise.It has high hopes for the terminal at Rabaska in Quebec but it is also considering other regions in North America and is likely to focus on Texas, where it already has a small office in Houston.Mr Vasiliev said: “It is important that we have a position in the most liquid gas market, which is in Houston for Henry Hub.”Gazprom said at the weekend that it would hold talks with ConocoPhillips and BP on the planned Alaskan gas pipeline.
530;COP;Conocophillips;2008-06-09T20:49:54Z;Lehman losses end hopes of Wall St bounce;;"In a bumpy session of trading on Monday, Wall Street rebounded limply from Friday’s dramatic sell-off as analyst upgrades buoyed the energy sector offsetting another poor session for financials.Energy stocks were the leading gainers after Goldman Sachs recommended investors buy into the sector, highlighting ConocoPhillips and Hess, among others. Goldman analysts said share prices were relatively inexpensive while high oil prices might boost earnings.The sector has massively outperformed the broader S&P 500, adding 8.3 per cent compared with a 7.3 per cent decline. ExxonMobil, Conoco-Phillips and Hess added 2.6 per cent to $89.07, 3.3 per cent to $95.24 and 2.9 per cent to $127.47 respectively.Those gains helped markets skim past news of record losses at Lehman Brothers and comments from Fed officials that higher interest rates might be needed to curb inflation.The KBW banking index set new multi-year lows, while the S&P 500 index of financials fell 2.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,361.77 points; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent at 12,280.32 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,459.46 points.On Friday the Dow Jones suffered its biggest one-day fall since February 2007 as equity markets were hit by surging oil prices and a jump in the unemployment rate that pointed to continued recession-like conditions in the US economy.Some analysts argued that this was an over-reaction and stocks seesawed between gains and losses in afternoon trading.There were bright spots. McDonald’s rose 4.1 per cent to $59.31 after the fast-food chain said it had made gains in May same-store sales due to strong international demand. That did not stop the wider sector from falling 0.1 per cent.New data that showed a surprise rise in pending home sales in April helped improve sentiment. According to the National Association of Realtors, the index of pending home re-sales rose 6.3 per cent to 88.2, the highest level in six months. That too had a limited impact and an index of homebuilding stocks slipped 0.9 per cent.Energy and materials stocks were leading gainers, up 2.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Alcoa rose 7.5 per cent to $42.17 after Barron’s said the aluminium producer could rise markedly in value to $60 a share if it were to become a takeover target, citing a Citigroup analyst. Monsanto rose 2 per cent to $138.45 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 2.2 per cent to $118.26.Banking sector travails curbed those gains. Lehman, the smallest of the leading investment banks, said it lost $2.8bn in the second quarter and that it would raise $6bn in new capital.Fitch, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Lehman, while its peer Moody’s lowered its ratings outlook for the brokerage. Lehman, which has lost more than half its value in the past year, fell 8.7 per cent to $29.48, striking a 52-week lows before recovering slightly. The news hit the financial sector, which is reeling from the protracted fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis.Merrill Lynch fell 3.2 per cent to $37.76, JPMorgan lost 6.4 per cent to $37.51 and
Citigroup slid 2.3 per cent to $19.60. A UBS note suggesting Washington Mutual would suffer $21.7bn in mortgage losses through 2011 crushed the banks’ share price, while earnings downgrades for Fifth Third Bancorp and KeyCorp weighed on their stocks.WaMu slipped 17 per cent to $6.25, Fifth Third Bancorp edged up 0.2 per cent to $16.78 and KeyCorp fell 3.8 per cent to $16.65.In the past few weeks analysts have slashed earnings estimates for the financials sector with the result that according to Thomson Reuters the consensus estimate is for a 45 per cent decline in the second quarter.Technology shares slipped in spite of a positive note on the sector from Lehman.Apple led the fallers, off 2.2 per cent to $181.61 as investors took profits after the company unveiled a new and cheaper iPhone. Google slipped 1.6 per cent to $557.87 while Intel fell 1.8 per cent to $22.49.According to Thomson Reuters, tech is expected to achieve the second-highest earnings growth rate among leading industry sectors in the second quarter of 2008."
531;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-30T01:28:09Z;Petronas backs Santos LNG project;;World interest in Australia’s reserves of coal-bed methane was underlined on Thursday when Petronas of Malaysia agreed to invest $2.5bn in a liquefied natural gas project being developed at Gladstone by Santos, the Australian energy group.It comes as BG, the UK oil and gas exploration group, was locked in late-stage talks to buy Origin Energy for A$13.6bn ($13bn) in cash, equalling A$15.50 a share.The parties were working towards a deadline of making an announcement before the Australian stock exchange opened on Friday morning.BG wants Origin in order to get control of coal-bed methane reserves in Queensland’s Bowen and Surat basins, which would then be transported hundreds of kilometres overland to the port of Gladstone.Santos and Petronas said on Thursday they planned to build an LNG plant in Gladstone, the world’s first such project to convert coal-seam gas into LNG.Under the deal, Petronas will take a 40 per cent stake in the A$7.7bn Gladstone project, which will have an initial capacity of 3m tonnes per annum, with first exports expected by 2014. Petronas needs to invest a further A$3bn to fund its share of the project, lifting its total commitment to nearly $5.5bn, although part of that could be debt funded.The deal also underlines the growth in demand for gas which is increasingly recognised as a cleaner burning fuel.“It is becoming a fuel of choice and the fuel of the future,” a person close to the deal said. “This deal underscores the viability of coal-seam gas.”David Knox, acting chief executive of Santos, said. “No one has done coal seam gas to LNG anywhere else in the world.”Petronas has been scouting the world for quality gas assets and is particularly interested in coal bed methane.The Malaysian state-owned energy group is understood to have outbid rivals in the final states of an auction.Groups that had expressed an interest in the Gladstone project included Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips of the US, Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, and Sempra, owner of the largest US natural gas utility.Petronas will make an initial cash investment of $2bn, plus a further payment of $500m after a decision is made on a second LNG train.BG formed a joint venture with Queensland Gas Company in February to develop an A$8bn liquefied natural gas project in Gladstone, one of four projects based on coal-seam gas.The Petronas transaction requires approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board.Santos was advised by Citi, with JPMorgan acting for Petronas.
532;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-29T20:40:38Z;US stocks rise as oil prices edge down;;Wall Street stocks rose for a third straight session on Thursday as oil prices dropped, financials rallied on a bullish analyst report and data showed the US economy grew faster than previously thought in the first quarter.Crude prices dipped well below $130 a barrel on Thursday, giving companies dependent on discretionary consumer spending a boost.Some macroeconomic data also buoyed sentiment. In spite of inflation and the credit crisis, first-quarter gross domestic product came in at a revised 0.9 per cent, suggesting the US economy may yet skirt a full-blown recession.A rally in financials kicked markets into decidedly positive territory after a report from JPMorgan predicted the sector was due for a bounce based on tightening spreads on bank credit default swaps.Still, a rise in the number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week, after an unexpected fall in the prior week, held gains in check.The benchmark S&P 500 trimmed gains at the close but remained 0.5 per cent higher at 1,398.23 for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.4 per cent at 12,646.22. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent to 2,508.32.In the past few days, equities have recovered about half the ground they lost last week as softening energy prices have offered some respite to US consumers.Rising prices are having a mixed impact on corporations and households. On Thursday, Sears Holdings, the department store chain, reported an unexpected first-quarter net loss, knocking its share price 3.6 per cent to $86.14.Analysts said that the store’s middle-of-the-range goods were particularly susceptible to the current economic slowdown as consumers were trading down to cheaper brands in order to save money. Conversely, Big Lots, which sells excess inventory, reported better-than-expected quarterly profits and raised its full-year earnings forecast.HJ Heinz was another consumer-facing company to report positive results and forecasts. The food group said fourth-quarter profit rose thanks to gains from currency effects and higher prices and raised its predictions for full-year earnings.Big Lots shares climbed 7.5 per cent to $30.66, Heinz climbed 3.6 per cent to $49.25, while the consumer discretionary sector added 1 per cent.Whether corporations will be able to maintain that earnings growth going forward remains a moot point.Alongside the other data released on Thursday, the Department of Commerce noted that corporate profit growth during the first quarter rose 3.8 per cent after falling 3.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year.The headline numbers may go some way to easing fears that corporate profits will be swamped by rising costs and falling demand. But the details were less salutary as domestic profits and profits from financial firms both declined.Many are sceptical about the broader earnings outlook. Strategists at UBS said: “Estimates for this year may still be a bit high given our forecast for slowing growth and peaking margins . . . Moreover, estimates for 2009 appear far too rosy, driven by a forecast record expansion of profit margins.”Some of the weakest performers earlier in the week were amongst the strongest gainers on Thursday. Healthcare advanced 1.5 per cent in part due to a Goldman Sachs recommendation that investors should by call options in the sector.Merck was a notable gainer, adding 0.7 per cent to $38.92 after a series of court decisions overturned claims against the pharmaceutical giant resulting from its withdrawn painkiller, Vioxx.Consumer staples and financials added 1.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively.In financials, Bank of America, which rose 2.2 per cent to $34.60 and Citigroup, which added 2 per cent to $22.04, led the way.MasterCard was another stand-out, rising 7.7 per cent to $309, after it raised its targets for profit growth. Rivals Visa and American Express advanced 4.1 per cent to $85.25 and 1.3 per cent to $46.75 respectively.But material and energy stocks followed commodity prices lower, losing 0.9 per cent each. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and ConocoPhillips dropped 5.4 per cent to $113.18 and 1.7 per cent to $90.96.
533;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-28T20:41:19Z;US stocks climb in volatile session;;Wall Street stocks climbed for a second session on Wednesday, after a stop-start day of trading that featured bad news from regional banks, a lurch in oil prices that boosted related stocks but trimmed advances elsewhere and a steady rally in materials.A drop in crude prices initially sent markets into positive territory, a trend reinforced by data showing an unexpected rise in orders for core durable goods in April.By mid-afternoon in New York, oil prices had made an abrupt U-turn, retracing earlier declines. This combined with a sell-off in financials to forestall the positive momentum - but only temporarily.A rally in materials stocks, which followed some commodity prices higher, helped kick the broader equity markets back into the black in late afternoon.By the end of the day, materials had added 2.8 per cent, breaking a four session loosing streak and powering to their biggest one day gains in a month.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,390.87, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.4 per cent at 12,594.03. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,486.70.On Tuesday, falling crude prices and some post-holiday cheer helped markets bounce back from their biggest weekly fall in three months. The momentum carried investors through another round of dismal housing statistics and a survey showing languishing consumer confidence.The consumer discretionary sector held onto narrow gains on Wednesday, adding 0.4 per cent thanks to decent results from American Eagle Outfitters and Polo Ralph Lauren.American Eagle shares, which have lost 36 per cent of their value over the last year, clawed back 8.1 per cent to $18.61.Polo Ralph Lauren surged 11.7 per cent to $69 after the clothing brand reported an unexpected increase in fourth-quarter profit, helped by its new line for JC Penney and sales in Europe.Expedia also made ground, advancing 4.7 per cent to $22.75 on speculation that chairman Barry Diller might attempt to take the internet travel agency private.Despite pockets of outperformance, the picture for retailers remains bleak. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, weekly chain store sales stalled last week as gasoline prices continued to drag on consumer spending.Investment banks were in the spotlight again on Wednesday after JPMorgan became the latest brokerage to cut its earnings estimates for the sector, citing Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley in particular.JPMorgan analysts argued that less effective hedges, slowing client activity and yet more write-offs would hurt results. The group advised investors to steer clear of the sector.The sector swung between gains and losses during the day before settling up 0.4 per cent. Lehman slipped 1 per cent to $36.84, hit also by suggestions it might need to raise more capital, while Goldman and Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $174.83 and 1.3 per cent to $42.77 respectively.AIG, the insurance group, was among the sector’s biggest fallers, dropping 4.7 per cent to $34.91 after a Citi analyst suggested it might need more capital on top of the $20.3bn it has raised.Regional commercial banks also came under pressure after KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, doubled its forecast for loans that are unlikely to be repaid.KeyCorp slumped 10.4 per cent to $19.66 and was followed down by Regions Financial and Huntington Bancshares, which dropped 5 per cent to $18.08 and 4.9 per cent to $9.04 respectively.Commercial banks, as measured by the KBW index, have lost over 12 per cent of their value since the start of the month and are down about 37 per cent since their highs in February 2007.Energy-sensitive stocks such as carmakers swung from profits to losses as energy prices rebounded above $130. Ford fell 0.3 per cent to $6.78 while General Motors lost 1.6 per cent to $17.15.The volte-face in oil prices also helped energy groups overturn early losses and snap a four-session losing streak. Chevron rose 0.8 per cent to $100.42, ConocoPhillips added 2.1 per cent to $92.56, while the sector as a whole rose 1.5 per cent.In materials, Ashland, Allegheny Technologies and Monsanto were among the leading gainers, advancing 5.2 per cent to $58.19, 5.1 per cent to $76.73 and 5.3 per cent to $125.32.
534;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-27T18:50:40Z;Pressure builds for green chief at ExxonMobil;;"Nineteen institutional investors, including some of ExxonMobil’s largest shareholders, have said they will support a resolution on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting to split the posts of chairman and chief executive.The shareholders want to appoint a chairman who will invest in technologies to combat climate change.In recent years, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have trumpeted their investments in wind, solar and biofuels. Exxon had remained relatively quiet about its investments until momentum on the proxy measure started to build.Now it is mounting a more spirited defence. Ken Cohen, vice-president of public affairs, told the FT that Exxon would spend more than $100m this year to develop low-emission and alternative-energy technology. The company hopes to make advances in fuel efficiency, carbon capture and biofuels. “We’re looking for the ‘ahas’,’’ Mr Cohen said. “We’re looking for the genius-type breakthroughs.”Over the past five years, according to Mr Cohen, Exxon has spent $2bn to improve its own energy efficiency and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. In the next three years it will commit a further $800m to that effort. It has also spent $200m in the past five years on developing alternative energy technology.Mr Cohen outlined inventions that the company has made in recent years that have benefited the environment. These include an improved inner liner that makes tyres lighter and retain air longer, so cars go farther on a gallon of petrol. Exxon has also developed light plastics for use in automobiles to enable them to use less fuel.The company does not want to invest in areas where government subsidies are required. Corn-based ethanol and current generation solar, for example, are not robust enough to go global and truly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Exxon says.That does not mean it is not hopeful for the future. It is investing in a plastic film that will protect a lithium-ion battery from short-circuiting and overheating when scaled up for use in hybrid and electric cars. The separator film will make such vehicles more efficient and economic when they are deployed in 2009-2010.If just 10 per cent of cars were traded in for hybrid or electric vehicles, that would take 5m cars off the road and save 28m tons of carbon dioxide, according to Pat Brant, chief polymer scientist at Exxon’s chemical company. “We’re going to help make it a reality.”In addition, Exxon is co-operating with Toyota, Caterpillar and others on improving fuel efficiency by 30 per cent; the area of hydrogen generation, which could lead to an 80 per cent improvement in fuel economy; and technology to make carbon capture and storage more affordable and therefore realistic.The company is also working with scientists at Stanford University and others on breakthrough solar and cellulosic technology.Exxon’s critics insist it could be doing more. Between 2007 and 2009, Chevron, which also does not have an independent chairman, plans to spend $2.5bn on alternative and renewable energy technologies and efficiency services.But, as Garfield Miller, chief executive of Aegis Energy Advisors, asks: “Should we be asking Exxon, or anyone, to be an inefficient mutual fund for alternative energy?”"
535;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-21T23:39:55Z;US oil companies defend high profits;;"Top oil executives defended their record profits and called for the US to open up more fields for exploration at a heated congressional hearing on Wednesday that reflected increasing political pressure on lawmakers to tackle the rising cost of petrol.As the price of crude oil broke through $133 per barrel, Stephen Simon, senior vice-president of Exxon­Mobil, the biggest US oil company, told the Senate judiciary committee: “Our profitability in absolute terms is large but must be viewed in the context of the massive scale of our industry and our dependence on high earnings in the current up cycle to sustain the huge investments required over the long term.”Mr Simon, along with executives from BP, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, were grilled by lawmakers including Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, who said: “You rack up record profits, quarter after quarter after quarter, and apparently have no ethical compass about the price of gasoline and think you are victims.”Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat pushing for the removal of an exemption to antitrust laws granted to members of Opec said: “Consumers are angry and they have every right to be. The oil industry seems to get richer and richer.”Even as the soaring cost of energy has risen up the political agenda, US politicians have struggled to find common ground on energy policy, except for a recent bipartisan effort to force the Bush administration to stop filling America’s strategic petroleum reserve.While Democrats have called for removing tax breaks for oil companies in order to direct more investment to renewable energy, many Republicans are asking for restrictions to be lifted on exploration.The Republican proposals were broadly backed by the oil executives on Wednesday. “We cannot expect other countries to expand their resource development to meet America’s needs when our government limits development at home,” said
Peter Robertson, vice-chairman of Chevron. However, the arguments put forward by the energy companies were met with strong scepticism.Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, asked: “Does it trouble any of you when you see what you are doing to us, the profits that you are taking, the costs the you are imposing on working families, small businesses, truckers, farmers?”"
536;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-20T20:51:07Z;Wall St hit by fears of prolonged credit crisis;;Wall Street stock markets were knocked off four-month highs on Tuesday after a rise in core inflation and record high oil prices threatened to trim corporate profits and a leading banking analyst said the credit crisis could extend well beyond 2009.The latest inflation figures gave a mixed picture of the price pressures on US businesses. Prices paid to producers in April, excluding food and fuel, rose twice as fast as forecast but a surprise decline in gasoline prices restrained overall increases to 0.2 per cent.Still, analysts said the trend was clear. “Inflation pressures are mounting and that is spooking the market,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “And of course record oil prices aren’t helping.”Crude prices pushed above $129 for the first time after billionaire investor T. Boone Pickens predicted oil could hit $150 and a number of analysts raised their price targets for 2008.The strains on the consumer of high fuel prices appear to be limited – so far. Home Depot joined the group of retailers who have posted first-quarter results that were not as bad as feared.The numbers were poor nonetheless. The home-improvement retailer said on Monday that net income slumped 66 per cent to $356m on revenue down 3.4 per cent to $17.9bn.Home Depot shares, which have lost about a quarter of their value in the last year, fell another 5.2 per cent to $27.37.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed the day down 0.9 per cent at 1,413.42 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.5 per cent lower at 12,828.68. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,492.26.On Monday US stocks pared gains in late trading but held on to close at their highest levels since early January after new data suggested that the US economy may skirt outright recession.Significant drag factors remain, foremost among which are the cascading effects of the credit crisis.According to Meredith Whitney and a team of analysts from Oppenheimer, the extended credit crisis will result in further multi-billion dollar revenue reversals at the major banks.“We believe the real harrowing days of the credit crisis are still in front of us and will prove more widespread in effect than anything yet seen,” Ms Whitney said.The culprit is less the writedowns themselves than the “shut-down” in the securitisation market which at its height provided 66 per cent of household borrowings in the first quarter of 2007.Without that market, consumer credit losses may be “far worse than what is currently estimated, even by the most draconian of investors”. Ms Whitney and her colleagues also slashed their 2008 earnings estimates for the large-cap banking stocks they cover by an average of 17 per cent.Financial stocks were among the leading fallers in the S&P 500, dropping 2.2 per cent while an index of investment banking shares also slumped 2.2 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 3 per cent to $44.80, JPMorgan lost 5 per cent to $43.70 and Citigroup slipped 3.8 per cent to $22.11.Elsewhere, AIG, the insurer hit by massive subprime-related losses, said it would raise about 60 per cent more capital than it originally indicated in order to strengthen its balance sheet, knocking its share price 2.1 per cent to $38.12.On Tuesday, concerns about rising input costs, as well as a credit rating downgrade for a leading homebuilder, hurt the consumer discretionary sector in particular. The sector fell 1.6 per cent, led down by Centex and KB Home which lost 5.5 per cent to $21.81 and 5.5 per cent to $23.15 respectively.Amid the broader market malaise, energy was one of the few sectors to find any positive momentum. ConocoPhillips rose 0.9 per cent to $93.55, Chevron added 0.9 per cent to $103.09 and the broader sector climbed 0.8 per cent.After a strong run last week materials were largely flat on Tuesday, as rising gold prices weighed against analysts’ comments that weaker demand from China might result in soft metal prices. Newmont Mining rose 1.7 per cent to $49.88 but Alcoa fell 3.1 per cent to $43.23.Packaging stocks were also hit by a number of analyst downgrades. Sealed Air deflated, falling 4.4 per cent to $23.96 while Bemis dropped 4.1 per cent to $26.45.
537;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-19T21:19:03Z;Groups see unconventional future for crude;;Unconventional oil is the future, both for the world’s fuel supplies and for western oil companies. The announcement on Monday from Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, that it had found a deposit of oil sands in the Republic of Congo that could contain many billions of barrels was a dramatic illustration of that.The world has huge resources of oil sands and other forms of heavy oil, which does not flow easily and cannot be conventionally produced from wells.Yet developing these resources presents formidable challenges that are likely to set a limit on the rate at which they can be produced, putting a constraint on their commercial potential and their importance as a source of oil supplies.Interest in unconventional oil has mounted as the price of crude has soared past $120 a barrel. Traditional oil regions in the west, such as the North Sea, are in decline, and access to resources in many oil-rich countries, such as Russia and Venezuela, has become increasingly difficult for a variety of reasons, generally political.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, believes conventional production from countries outside Opec, the producers’ group, will peak in the next decade.“For oil companies trying to grow, they will either have to go to Opec countries, which is not easy, or look at unconventional oil,” says Rhodri Thomas of Wood Mackenzie.All the big international oil companies have some involvement in unconventional oil. Even BP, which held out for years after its rivals had committed to heavy oil, announced a joint venture in Canada’s oil sands with Husky Energy late last year.Heavy oil projects are being pursued in places including Tatarstan in Russia, where Royal Dutch Shell won a contract last year, Madagascar, Albania and Romania.By far the two biggest known resources, however, are in Canada and Venezuela, and in both countries the development of heavy oil has run into problems.In Venezuela, the drive by President Hugo Chávez to renegotiate contracts on the heavy oil upgrader projects, which process the oil into a form that can be readily sold on world markets, has prompted ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips of the US to pull out.Only Eni among the western companies has announced substantial fresh investment in Venezuela since those moves from Mr Chávez, with a planned commitment worth an estimated $4bn. Other investments welcomed by Mr Chávez are from countries such as China.“It is not that Venezuela’s resources are not there, it is just whether the strategic partners the country has been selecting have the technology to develop those resources in the short term,” says David Fyfe of the International Energy Agency, the developed countries’ energy watchdog.In Canada, there has been a flood of foreign investment, but there are also mounting concerns about the effect of developing the oil sands on the environment, especially because of their use of water and their carbon dioxide emissions.Imperial Oil, which is 70 per cent owned by Exxon, last month lost a court appeal against a regulatory ruling denying it a water use permit for a large new oil sands project.Canadian oil sands projects have also been hit by soaring costs because of shortages of staff and equipment.Eni’s Congo development will have lower costs, the company says, and water is plentiful in the area. However, environmental constraints will bite here, too. The project is in the forest, and trees will be felled to clear space so the oil sands can be mined.Eni says it will proceed carefully and restore the forest once the oil has been extracted. But that will limit output to at most 200,000 barrels a day.As Mr Thomas of Wood Mackenzie puts it: “The volumes are there. It’s a question of how quickly you can get them out of the ground in an economic fashion. And there are bottlenecks in a wide range of systems.”
538;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-19T18:47:09Z;Running on empty? Fears over oil supply move into the mainstream;;On a rainy day last month, four drummers, three guitarists, a bagpiper, two didgeridoo players and 186 others assembled in the rural English town of Cirencester to discuss turning their neighbourhoods into low-impact communities built around farming, arts and crafts and herbal medicine.After communal meditation and a few speeches, those present gathered in small groups to discuss everything from transport without oil to engaging local politicians in the “Transition Towns” movement’s stated aim: reducing their carbon footprint in response to concerns over diminishing hydrocarbon reserves as well as global warming. The mood in the group discussing energy was sombre. One former civil engineer predicted the demise of the lightbulb within a decade and derided the idea that market forces and human ingenuity could save the planet, laughing it off as “the magic wand” theory.For years, such meetings have been dismissed as eccentric. Most of the world’s oil executives, government ministers, analysts and consultants reject the “peak oil” theory – the notion based on the 1950s work of Marion King Hubbert, a Shell geologist, that crude production will soon enter terminal decline. They say it understates remaining reserves, plays down the contribution of technological advances and ignores the role of market forces in shaping future supply.But with the oil price at a record $126 a barrel, more than 1,000 per cent higher than a decade ago, fears of the end of the hydrocarbon age have seeped into the mainstream. Many in the industry itself now accept that supply constraints are shaping the price as much as rampant demand. Calls for greater investment to ease these constraints formed the crux of many of the discussions at last month’s meeting in Rome between energy ministers of the world’s main oil producers and consumers. A few weeks later, analysts at Goldman Sachs and elsewhere, as well as ministers of the Opec oil cartel, predicted that prices could reach $200 within two years.So are the peak oilists right? A series of recent events certainly appears to lend credence to those who argue that the world’s ageing oilfields are being sucked dry amid China’s and India’s determination to lift themselves out of poverty and the west’s reluctance to give up the luxuries of modern oil-dependent life.The fact that Russia’s oil production declined almost half a percentage point in April, the first drop in a decade, was shocking enough news from the world’s second biggest oil producer, whose output was growing at a rate of 12 per cent just five years ago. But Russian oil executives have gone a step further: Leonid Fedun, vice-president of Lukoil, told the Financial Times the country’s production may have already reached its peak.Just days later Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil producer and by far the largest exporter, confirmed it had put on hold plans to increase the kingdom’s production capacity. Ali Naimi, Saudi energy minister, said the demand forecasts he was reading did not warrant an expansion past the 12.5m b/d capacity Saudi Arabia’s fields will reach next year, following a laborious investment of more than $20bn (£10.3bn, €12.9bn). King Abdullah, the country’s ruler, put it more bluntly: “I keep no secret from you that, when there were some new finds, I told them, ‘No, leave it in the ground, with grace from God, our children need it’.’’Most other forecasts show the world will need Saudi Arabia’s oil. Thus the kingdom’s reluctance to invest further in its fields has led some to ask whether Saudi Arabia can boost production or whether, after 75 years, the world’s biggest oil deposit has been cashed.Friday’s announcement by Mr Naimi that Saudi Arabia would pump slightly more oil did little to ease prices because it failed to reduce concerns over supply: when the kingdom produces more oil, it eats into its cushion of spare supply. This means such measures sometimes backfire, driving prices higher – the opposite of what US President George W. Bush, who requested the increased output, had in mind.One problem is that nobody really knows what is going on inside Saudi Arabia’s oil industry. Riyadh is so guarded that analysts from Sanford Bernstein, the financial services company, took to spying on its activity via satellite. They spent nine months monitoring the country’s drilling activities and measuring whether Ghawar, the world’s biggest oil­field, had subsided. Their conclusion: Saudi Arabia is having to work harder than the country’s engineers and geologists expected in 2004 to squeeze more out of the northern part of the ageing Ghawar field.Matthew Simmons, an energy investment banker, has a bleaker view of Ghawar’s health. He took the news that Saudi Arabia was not planning to expand to 15m b/d as further evidence that the kingdom was struggling to ward off a collapse of its oilfields.With his book Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy, published in 2005, Mr Simmons, more than any other individual, laid the seeds of doubt over Saudi Arabia’s future reliability. Poring over 200 technical papers written by engineers over 20 years, some stored electronically and others gathering dust in the filing cabinets of the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ offices on the outskirts of Dallas, Texas, he uncovered evidence the kingdom’s fields were far more complicated to tap and declining more quickly than the secretive nation was willing to reveal.Less well known, but equally damning, is his study of the rest of the world’s oilfields. Mr Simmons launched his project in 2001 after none of the analysts brought in to help the US Central Intelligence Agency map the world’s remaining big sources of oil came up with answers that satisfied him.He found that the world depends on just a few giant, old, declining oilfields and that almost nothing to match them has been discovered since the 1970s. One in every five barrels of oil consumed each day is pumped from a field that is more than 40 years old. Not a single field discovered in the past 30 years has ever been able to produce more than 1m b/d and the number and size of fields discovered since then have been shrinking dramatically.Output declines as an oilfield ages – sometimes dramatically. One example is Mexico’s Cantarell field. Discovered by a fisherman in 1976, Cantarell at its peak produced more than 2m b/d. Today, the field pumps half that volume and is in relentless decline, losing 24 per cent of its production each year.The same trend – though at a slower pace – is plaguing most fields around the world, possibly including the four biggest: Ghawar, Cantarell, Kuwait’s Burgan and China’s Daqing. This means running to stand still: each year as much as two-thirds of new oil supply capacity goes towards covering for the slowdown at ageing fields.Mr Simmons’ work is potent fodder for peak oilists, who espouse their gloomy views of the future on websites ranging from those with an academic air to more alarmist ones that come complete with advertisements for freeze-dried food and survival guides.Hubbert in 1956 correctly predicted that US production would peak between 1965 and 1970. His later forecasts proved less reliable, as did prophecies by his followers. The Hubbert model maintains that the production rate of a finite resource follows a largely symmetrical bell-shaped curve, meaning that post-peak life could turn quickly to economic turmoil followed by a horse-and-cart existence.Mr Simmons knows his peak oil views have moved him towards the fringes of a business in which he used to occupy a far more central position. But he is not alone. T. Boone Pickens and Richard Rainwater, the billionaire US investors whose net worth is estimated at more than $3bn each, have profited from their view of peak oil, through their hedge funds of mainly oil and gas holdings. Last Thursday Mr Pickens placed a $2bn order for the first 667 of 2,500 wind turbines that he plans to erect on the Texas Panhandle as he goes about building the world’s biggest wind farm.Fears over supply increasingly extend to the corner offices of international oil companies. James Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips of the US, and Christophe de Margerie, his counterpart at Total of France, both recently said they did not think world oil production would ever surpass 100m b/d.That is the amount of oil the International Energy Agency, the consuming nations’ watchdog, estimates the world will need in seven years’ time. By 2030, it will need 16m b/d more.Mr Mulva and Mr de Margerie would take deep offence at being called peak oilists. But they, together with a rapidly growing number of industry executives and ministers, believe the world is running out of “easy oil” and that political barriers – such as Nigeria’s crippling unrest, the nationalisation that has stunted Russia’s energy industry and the international tensions that have for two decades stymied Iraq’s energy potential – are keeping companies from being able to exploit the 2,400bn-4,400bn barrels that remain.Instead of preparing for Armageddon, they are using technologies such as horizontal drilling to squeeze more oil out of their old fields and looking for reserves in harsher terrains. But even they advocate that consumers, who rely on oil for everything from light to lipstick, should be less wasteful.Industry executives admit that fields in the developed world, such as those in the North Sea and Alaska, are about to peak. (Sanford Bernstein believes production outside Opec will peak this year.) But they argue that unconventional fields, such as those in Alberta and in Venezuela’s Orinoco belt, hold more barrels of oil than Saudi Arabia, while the Arctic’s riches could be immense as well.Natural gas, coal, corn, sugar cane, algae and turkey innards are promising alternative sources that could fuel China’s new love affair with the car, they say. Meanwhile the biggest oilfield, as Joseph Stanislaw, adviser to Deloitte Consulting, likes to point out, lies beneath Detroit. In other words, millions of barrels a day of oil could be saved if Americans traded in their gas-guzzlers for more efficient vehicles.All of this means global production will follow an “undulating plateau for one or more decades before declining slowly”, says Peter Jackson of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an industry consulting firm. After studying its oil production and resources database, the group concluded that it saw no decline in the world’s ability to produce oil before 2030, making Cera’s one of the most sanguine forecasts.But the ride could yet prove a bumpy one, even Cera admits. Saudi Arabia’s spare capacity is at its lowest level in a generation, having been eaten into by China and other fuel-hungry customers. It now stands at 2m-3m b/d, too little to cover a big interruption in supplies from elsewhere. This has already added a sizeable premium to international oil prices, though no one has a grasp of exactly how much.Meanwhile, the long-term alternatives have serious downsides. The Alberta project is a big, dirty mining operation, both energy- and water-intensive. Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s populist president, has made it risky for international oil companies to pour billions of dollars into the Orinoco belt. The technology to tap the Arctic’s big reserves and bring them back ashore has not been invented. Regarding power of the solar, wind and turkey-gut varieties, even the most optimistic forecasts say these will remain a small fraction of the overall energy mix.In fact, even if all the policies to increase renewable fuels and to use oil more efficiently were to be enacted immediately, the world would still need Opec’s daily production to increase by 11.5m barrels by 2030, the bulk of which would have to come from Saudi Arabia, the IEA says.That is a tall order. It is 50-plus per cent more than the amount by which Opec managed to increase output between 1980 and 2006. This time, the oil business is faced with a shortage of skilled labour (the industry’s average age is just shy of 50) and a squeeze in the supply of steel and other critical components.So what if politics, an ageing workforce and a dearth of equipment get in the way and Saudi Arabia cannot – or will not – come to the rescue? Will the peak oilists turn out to be right, for the wrong reasons?The answer depends on the market’s ability to adjust. For optimists, the worst that could happen is high oil prices eventually damp demand while giving the entrepreneurially inclined time to think of ingenious ways to produce and conserve energy.Growth in demand is in fact already slowing, especially in the US and other developed countries. Neil McMahon, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, suggests the downturn in developed countries may prove large enough to allow hungrier nations, such as those within Opec and China, to continue to demand increasing volumes of oil. “The question is: Have these [developed] nations been squeezed enough yet, or will prices have to go higher?” he asks in a recent report. Though he leaves open the possibility that prices will continue to rise for a while, he argues: “Based on 3.5 per cent [growth in] global GDP, overall oil demand growth will be close to zero.”Guy Caruso (right), head of the Energy Information Administration, the statistical and forecasting arm of the US Department of Energy, also points to the power of the market to drive changes in government policy and the behaviour of consumers and oil companies. “As you know, we are not believers in peak oil. We believe the above-ground risk is the issue,” he says.The EIA predicts that US imports of oil and petroleum products will decrease slightly in the next 22 years. This means the import dependence of the world’s biggest oil consumer is forecast to drop from 60 per cent to 50 per cent by 2015 before climbing again slightly to 54 per cent by 2030. The reasons for the drop include improved car efficiency, slower demand, higher use of biofuels and a 1m b/d increase in oil production from the US’s Gulf of Mexico by 2012. “One of the things M. King Hubbert couldn’t have known is about the technology to drill in 12,000 feet of water and to drill horizontally,” Mr Caruso says.A pessimist’s version of events would include a more serious and widespread downturn, as developing countries buckle under the burden of subsidising their citizens’ swelling fuel and food bills. At the extreme end are the views of Jeremy Leggett, a geologist turned entrepreneur and author of Half Gone: Oil, Gas, Hot Air and the Global Energy Crisis. In his worst-case scenario parable, he writes: “The price of houses collapsed. Stock markets crashed …Companies went bankrupt …Workers fell into unemployment by the hundreds of thousands and then millions. Once affluent cities with street cafés now had queues at soup kitchens and armies of beggars on the streets.”Industry executives dismiss this as doom-mongering so corrosive that it has the power to distort policy and investment decisions. But such visions also have the power to prompt people to use energy more efficiently. The bagpipers and didgeridoo players of Transition Towns are indeed already a part, if only a small one, of the solution to the uncertainties ahead – even if the world never has to experience quite the disaster that they predict.
539;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-16T17:59:58Z;US energy stocks race ahead;;Wall Street stocks slipped back on Friday but remained ahead for the week as resurgent oil prices boosted energy stocks but threatened to squeeze already weak consumer spending and financials lost ground.Energy stocks were in sharp focus again. Oil prices hit record highs after analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their oil price forecast for the second half of 2008 from $107 to $141 a barrel.ConocoPhillips shares rose 2.1 per cent to $91.19, Chevron added 1.4 per cent to $99.88 and an index of energy stocks advanced 1.5 per cent.As oil moved higher, consumer discretionary stocks shrank back. The sector slipped 1.5 per cent in early trading, led down by Liz Claiborne, which fell 6.7 per cent to $18.24 and Jones Apparel, which dropped 5.7 per cent to $16.68.The sector was not helped by the latest Reuters/University of Michigan index that showed consumer confidence this month slumped to the lowest level in 28 years.Financials also proved a weak spot, slumping 1.7 per cent after Merrill Lynch analysts recommended selling regional banks and Nobel Prize winner Myron Scholes said the worst of the credit crisis may not be over.KeyCorp and Regions Financial led the sector lower, dropping 5.1 per cent to $23.80 and 5.4 per cent to $20.16, respectively.By lunchtime in New York, the benchmark S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent to 1,416.66 yesterday but up 2.1 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent lower at 12,904.32 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,512.90.The technology sector was notably active this week. Hewlett-Packard, started the ball rolling on Tuesday when it tabled a $13.9bn deal to buy Electronic Data Systems. HP shares fell 5.2 per cent to $46.60 over the week while EDS was among the weeks leading gainers, rising 29 per cent to $24.33.Equities were surprisingly jaunty this week and markets are on course for their best performance since mid-April. Of the leading S&P 500 industrial groups, the energy and material sectors were the standouts, adding 3.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively.Earnings from retailers that were not as bad as feared and the stimulating prospects of government rebates played a part in that rally. Consumer discretionary stocks added 3.1 per cent over the week.On Wednesday, Macy’s reiterated its annual forecasts, in spite of tough trading conditions, and saw its share prices bounce. That picture of weak but better-than-expected results has been a hallmark of the first- quarter earnings season and some analysts expect the pattern to sustain equity markets.Analysts at UBS said: “We think the S&P 500 should continue rallying from here as investor’s price in resilience and sustainability in earnings.”The outlook for financials is less rosy. Meredith Whitney, at Oppenheimer, slash- ed her earnings forecasts for brokers this week, citing accounting changes, weakness in the capital markets and reduced revenues.But over the week, financial stocks rose 0.8 per cent on the back of some positive news. On Wednesday, for example, Freddie Mac posted a smaller-than-expected loss.In the background, the saga surrounding Yahoo and its decision to reject a take-over offer from software giant Microsoft trundled on.Yahoo is now fighting efforts by billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn to replace its board and force the company back into negotiations with Microsoft. Over the week, Yahoo shares rose 7.3 per cent to $27.80 and Microsoft shares added 2.2 per cent to $30.05.Homebuilders were also in focus as dismal data and earnings from the sector continued to pour out.But stocks maintained their composure, taking solace from news of efforts in Congress to address the housing slump. Lennar and Centex added 7.1 per cent to $19.71 and 7.2 per cent to $22.90, respectively, over the week.
540;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-15T03:20:23Z;Oil and gas: Battle to exploit hidden riches;;When the United Arab Emirates is listed among the world’s top 10 oil producers, the UAE’s name could easily be substituted for that of Abu Dhabi.The emirate – which is the nation’s capital – is home to about 95 per cent of the UAE’s proven oil reserves and 90 per cent of its proven gas reserves.But, like other countries in the region, rising drilling and riggings costs, combined with shortages of skilled personnel and equipment, are affecting Abu Dhabi’s expansion plans.The emirate embarked on a multibillion-dollar programme a few years ago to increase oil production to 4m barrels a day, through the development of new and old fields, by the end of the decade. However, tight market conditions have meant delays seem inevitable.Abu Dhabi’s current production is around 2.6m b/d.“Things are moving more slowly than planned, mainly because of the tight markets in labour, services and materials,” says Ross Cassidy, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie.Officials say 4m b/d is still the target, with the ambition to reach it as quickly as possible, but there is a recognition that it will “take as long as it takes”.A report by the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London said in April that the UAE would boost oil production by more than 10 per cent to 3m b/d in 2012 – below earlier targets – as part of Opec plans to manage resources.The UAE has proven oil reserves of about 97.6bn barrels, according to the US’s Energy Information Administration, the fifth largest in the region, and there remains scope to increase production at numerous underdeveloped fields.Abu Dhabi is also one of the few Gulf countries where international companies are able to be fully operational. However, although there is no income tax in the UAE, oil companies remain an exception and pay 50 per cent or more, making for tight margins of an estimated $1 per barrel.The 75-year-old onshore and offshore oil concessions granted to foreign companies are set to expire in 2014 and 2018 respectively. Little has been said publicly about negotiations as the international oil companies try to get a better deal when the concessions are renewed.Another area where Abu Dhabi is seeking to expand is with non-associated gas. The UAE’s gas reserves are estimated to be the fifth largest in the world, with proven reserves of 214 trillion cubic feet.A significant development expected this year is the award of a $10bn sour gas contract by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) to develop the Shah field.The notoriously secretive company has kept its cards close to its chest, but ConocoPhillips said in April it expected to be “working” on the project. Royal Dutch Shell and Occidental had been viewed as frontrunners during the months-long negotiations.“Hopefully, there will be an announcement that we will be working together in the next month or two,” Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, told the FT in Houston.“ConocoPhillips’ win was a surprise as the industry expected Shell or Occidental to win,” said Mr Cassidy. “The company’s sour gas experience and aggressive bid perhaps gave it a competitive edge over its rivals, but it remains a very challenging project.”Yet there have also been difficulties with Abu Dhabi’s gas expansion plans.Officials had initially put the development of the Bab and Shah fields out to joint tender, hoping the two would eventually produce 3bn cu ft a day towards meeting rising demand for power generation and energy intensive industries.But the development of the Bab field has been delayed, mainly because of the scarcity of specialised equipment needed for the sour gas project. The lead time for some equipment is 18 months to two years, experts say.Adnoc elected to re-tender just for Shah as it is less complex and has higher liquid yields, analysts say.A large portion of Abu Dhabi’s gas is sour gas, which requires expensive and complicated production techniques to reduce high levels of toxic hydrogen sulphide.In an attempt to help the emirates meet soaring demand for gas for power generation, water desalination and industry as the UAE’s economies expand, a project called Dolphin, that imports 2bn cu ft a day from Qatar to Abu Dhabi, went online last year. That was a landmark because it was the first export pipeline within the region, said Mr Cassidy.But plans to increase its capacity to 3.2bn cu ft a day are unlikely to materialise any time soon because of a moratorium Qatar’s North Field until 2010.Occidental Petroleum of the US and Total of France are Abu Dhabi’s partners in Dolphin, which carries gas from Qatar’s North Field gas reservoir to the UAE and Oman.“It seems hard to believe there’s a gas supply shortfall,” says Mr Cassidy. “But gas is needed to support oil production as well as meet domestic demand and the whole region is facing supply pressures.”
541;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-15T03:20:23Z;Diversification: Search for other ways to kick the oil habit;;Abu Dhabi’s combination of energy and capital has always made industry an attractive option for an economy that wants to find the means to diversify and create a pool of quality jobs for its growing population.Industry – from traditional heavy industry such as steel, aluminium and petrochemicals to modern light industry such as aerospace, and even experimental sectors such as renewable energy – has taken centre stage on the planning table over the past few years as the government seeks to diversify the oil-dependent economy.“Industries which are capital- and energy-intensive are big pluses for us,” says Hussein Nowais, chief executive of government-owned Abu Dhabi Basic Industries Corporation, or Adbic. “We’re going into aluminum, petrochemicals, steel – these industries are highly automated and don’t need a lot of labour, so we can train our own people for them,” he says.Mubadala’s joint venture with Dubai Aluminium Company, Emal, will start producing aluminium in April 2010. The first phase is scheduled for completion in 2011 with a capacity of 750,000 metric tons. Adbic has already committed $2bn to plans to multiply the capacity of the emirate’s steel smelter over the next four years from 700,000 tons a year to 5m tons a year.That Abu Dhabi has the financial muscle to back – and get reasonable spreads on – its debt in notoriously difficult times for credit markets is uncontested, but the main challenge remains access to gas.Abu Dhabi may straddle the world’s fifth-largest gas reserves, but the costs and delays in turning its large reservoirs of dangerous sour gas, which is expensive to process, threaten to undermine broader industrial strategy.Mr Nowais concedes that the rapid development of real estate, tourism and industrial projects, along with the need for gas to re-inject into oil fields to maintain production, has created a potential shortage, which could take years to rectify. But he insists that the government is working hard to solve this, pointing to the expected award of a $10bn sour gas contract to ConocoPhillips. “We should streamline the execution of industrial projects and exploit gas reserves in parallel,” he says.To extract as much value from this capital-intensive production, the government is rolling out a “cluster concept”, encouraging manufacturers to congregate near main areas of production. It has already pushed the concept for basic industries, aviation, logistics and tourism.Polymers Park in Musaffah, on the outskirts of the capital, will encourage manufacturers processing basic petrochemicals products from Abu Dhabi and the wider Gulf to go into manufactured plastics. Even before its launch later this month, officials said a large number of plots had already been booked. The anchor investment is a joint venture, between Adbic and Low & Bonar of the UK, to produce artificial grass yarn.Extending the cluster concept into aluminium and steel, Adbic is also promoting Metals Park in the Khalifa Port Industrial Zone, the second pillar of industrial strategy, at Taweelah near the Abu Dhabi-Dubai border.Chemicals Industrial City will form a petrochemicals-related cluster at Taweelah, where two state entities have teamed up with Borealis to build the world’s largest green-field chemicals production facility by 2013.Looking ahead, Adbic says it is also considering building clusters around construction materials to help reduce the large amounts of specialised materials – such as pipes, ceramics and fibreglass – that the emirate is importing for its ongoing real estate boom.The strategy goes beyond heavy industry and related manufacturing. (Mubadala’s Masdar) includes plans to build manufacturing facilities for solar panels at the Taweelah zone. It is also looking closely at aerospace, competing with and at times jointly investing with neighbouring Dubai.Abu Dhabi pushed forward last year with deals with Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin that will see the emirate build its air-services business for both military and commercial aircraft.Mubadala’s Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies is seeking to expand its maintenance and repair business beyond its contract with Abu Dhabi’s national carrier, Etihad.Boeing is setting up a research and development centre in Abu Dhabi, while Mubadala’s 35 per cent stake in Italy’s Piaggio Aero Industries could lead to the manufacture of business aircraft in the emirate, opening the door to higher-end industry that Abu Dhabi wants to develop as part of the strategy of creating jobs.“And that all brings us back to aluminium,” one official says.
542;COP;Conocophillips;2008-05-06T20:45:16Z;Wall St rebound led by energy stocks;;Wall Street stock markets bounced back from early losses on Tuesday to hit their highest levels since the start of the year as record oil prices boosted energy companies and investors focused on the positive in a mixed batch of results from the financial sector.With oil climbing to $122 a barrel on Tuesday and analysts predicting that the $200 barrier could be breached within the next 6 to 24 months, shares in energy companies powered ahead. An index of the sector climbed 2.2 per cent.But it was the volatile fortunes of financials that drove markets. Dismal results from Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored enterprise, initially weighed on stocks, only for investors to find a silver lining amid the bad news as the day progressed.The benchmark S&P 500 recovered from early losses and closed 0.8 per cent higher at 1,418.40, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.4 per cent at 13,024.01. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 per cent to 2,483.31.The day began in downbeat fashion with news of yet more writedowns and job cuts at UBS, the Swiss bank that has been battered by the subprime crisis.Meanwhile, Legg Mason, the fund manager, posted its first loss in 25 years and said it planned to raise $1bn by selling 20 million equity units. Its shares slid 10.3 per cent to $56.30.However, the S&P 500 financials index swung into the black after positive comments by executives of Fannie Mae helped cushion news of $2.2bn first-quarter loss at the largest buyer of mortgages in the US.Shares in Fannie Mae, and its peer Freddie Mac, overturned losses of as much as 6 per cent after the company’s regulator said it would reduce Fannie Mae’s capital requirements. The move should allow Fannie to buy more mortgages.Fannie closed 8.9 per cent higher at $30.81 while Freddie was up 7.1 per cent at $27.33.NYSE Euronext, the stock exchange operator, also made ground, adding 7.2 per cent to $72.95 after it said first-quarter profit more than tripled on record volumes of trading. An index of financial stocks added 1 per cent.In energy, ConocoPhillips rose 1.8 per cent to $88.74 while Chevron added 1.3 per cent to $96.87.Oil and gas exploration and production company Anadarko Petroleum made the biggest gain in the sector, climbing 9.4 per cent to $74.53 after reporting estimate-beating earnings.Technology stocks also buoyed markets, led by AMD which climbed for a second session, adding 9 per cent to $7.12 on speculation that the chip maker could break itself up.Nonetheless, results from DR Horton underscored the scale of the problems facing the housing sector and the wider US economy. The largest US home builder lost $1.3bn in the second quarter after it wrote down the value of its land holdings and backlog of unsold homes.DR Horton shares fell as much as 3.8 per cent before recovering, popping 5.5 per cent to $16.85.In other earnings news, Qwest Communications, a local phone service provider, said first-quarter profit slid as customers abandoned their home lines. Qwest shares, which have lost 47 per cent of their value in the last year, fell 6 per cent, to $5.04.Also among the day’s leading fallers was food products manufacturer Sara Lee, which dropped 6.1 per cent to $13.86 in spite of posting an 82 per cent increase in third-quarter profits.The company, which makes Sara Lee cakes and Jimmy Dean sausages, fell short of expectations and said full-year 2008 earnings and revenues would also undershoot Wall Street’s estimates.Those earnings misses came as a raft of new evidence suggested the housing crisis and credit crunch were spilling over to the real economy.US business bankruptcy filings in April increased 49 per cent compared with a year earlier, as the slowing economy forced more companies to shut down.Moreover, according to the Federal Reserve, banks are tightening lending standards, making it more difficult for consumers and businesses alike to borrow.Tobias Levkovich, chief US strategist at Citigroup, said: “Given the tougher credit environment..it would seem very realistic to assume that more cyclical earnings estimates [will] face substantive downward guidance with equity market implications.”
543;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-30T17:37:34Z;Exxon blasted by its founding family;;The Rockefeller family, the longest continuous shareholder in ExxonMobil, on Wednesday blasted the world’s biggest listed oil company for failing to recognise the need to move away from oil and gas into alternative fuels.“We are trying to keep a giant from falling,” said Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, economist and great-granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller, the company’s founder. “ExxonMobil needs to reconnect with the forward-looking and entrepreneurial vision of my great-grandfather.”“As he noted, ‘If you want to succeed, you should strike out on new paths, rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success’,” she said. “ExxonMobil is profiting in the short term from investments and decisions made many years ago, and by focusing on a narrow path that ignores the rapidly shifting energy landscape around the world, including developing nations.”The Rockefeller family is abandoning its traditional behind-the-scenes role at Exxon as private energy companies of all stripes seek to find new ways to compete with state oil companies that now control more than 80 per cent of the world’s reserves.The family said Exxon appeared haunted by previous ill-fated forays into nuclear and solar power and should be making greater investments in alternative fuels.Competitors such as ConocoPhillips have called for new business models and have sought to find new, environmentally-friendly raw materials – even including chicken fat – that can be made into fuel.Peter O’Neill, head of the family committee dealing with ExxonMobil and great-great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller, said Exxon researchers told him in September that they had identified two promising alternative energy sources, but had not made any investments in them.“The takeaway was that they are not moving fast enough,” he said.Alan Jeffers, Exxon spokesman, told the Financial Times that oil and gas would provide up to 80 per cent of the world’s energy needs over the next 30 years and that “to abandon that would not be wise”.Exxon began as part of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, but the family has not had a representative on the board since 1911.However, its name still resonates with investors and it could help build support at the May 28 annual meeting for shareholder resolutions calling for an independent chairman to prod Exxon to “look beyond its short-term focus on oil and gas”.
544;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-24T20:48:38Z;Wall Street rally led by financials;;Wall Street stocks rallied for a second day on Thursday as financials led markets higher and investors picked out the positive in a mixed batch of earnings reports.The day began in gloomy fashion as cautious outlook statements from several corporations, including Apple and Amazon, stirred fears of a consumer-spending slowdown.Materials and energy stocks, which have supported equity markets for much of the past few weeks, had their worst day in over a month, following commodity prices lower in spite of strong results from industry leaders.But an unexpected rally in financials helped wipe out those declines thanks to upgrades and strong results at a handful of insurance companies.Homebuilders contributed to the turn in sentiment after the National Association of Home Builders said the US housing market would begin to recover in the third quarter, brushing aside new data showing sales of new homes slumped in March.The benchmark S&P 500 erased losses of as much as 0.6 per cent to close up 0.6 per cent at 1,388.82 while the Nasdaq Composite ended 1 per cent higher at 2,428.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,848.95.Financials advanced 3.8 per cent on Thursday, their biggest gain since the start of the month, as investors looking for a bottom to the market rotated out of energy stocks and into the downtrodden sector. T Rowe Price, the fund manager, led the gainers adding 11.8 per cent to $60.24 after posting its 20th straight quarterly increase in earnings.Insurers Travelers and Aflac added to that revival, climbing 4 per cent to $50.23 and 4.1 per cent to $67.76, respectively, after both beat first-quarter estimates and raised their full-year forecasts.Investment banks also made ground after the chief executive of Merrill Lynch said the firm would maintain its dividend. Merrill Lynch added 7.1 per cent to $48.09 while Lehman Brothers rose 6.2 per cent to $46.38.James McGlynn, portfolio manager of the Summit Everest Fund, said: “There was so much uncertainty going into the earnings season, people thought financials were going to drop another shoe, so the stocks have perhaps been overly discounted.”Mike Mayo, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said: “The crises now seems closer to the end, albeit with lingering uncertainty related to monoline insurers, CDO dispositions and short-term money markets.”As oil slipped off its highs and the dollar rallied, giving consumers more wiggle room, JC Penney climbed 3.5 per cent to $41.97 while Macy’s added 5 per cent to $24.36.Ford led the consumer sector higher after the car group unexpectedly swung into profit in the first quarter as reduced costs offset weak US sales. Ford jumped 11.7 per cent to $8.40 while rival General Motors added 5.6 per cent to $22.11.Companies reliant on discretionary spending had initially found it hard going after several bellwethers cut forecasts and were sold by anxious investors.Starbucks tumbled 10.4 per cent to $15.99, Whirlpool, the appliance maker, slid 10.1 per cent to $73.89 and 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $79.25.Homebuilders helped the advance. Lennar added 7.9 per cent to $18.38 while Pulte Homes rose 5.4 per cent to $13.81.In technology, too, early despair gave way to enthusiasm. Better-than-expected results and forecasts from LSI pushed the sector into the black. The maker of storage chips advanced 20.8 per cent to $5.99.By the close, Apple, which added 15 per cent in the month running up to the results, was 3.7 per cent higher at $168.94. Amazon fell 4.1 per cent at $77.69.Energy and materials stocks were a drag on indices. Gold producer Newmont Mining said first-quarter profit rose fivefold thanks to record prices for bullion but its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $42.94, mimicking the pattern of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold on Wednesday. Freeport shares fell 3 per cent to $112.61 while energy groups Chevron and ConocoPhillips dropped 2.2 per cent to $92.40 and 1.8 per cent to $82.96.Industrials rose after Northrop Grumman, the shipbuilder, and Goodrich, the aerospace components maker, posted better-than-expected results. Goodrich shares jumped 9.7 per cent to $67.66 while Northrop climbed 4.4 per cent $72.55.
545;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-24T20:11:37Z;US petrol price at historic low;;"Despite having reached an all-time high, US petrol prices are at a historical low in relation to crude oil prices, according to a study by a prominent think-tank at Rice University in Texas. Given stagnant or even falling demand at the pump, refiners are finding it difficult to pass oil price increases on to consumers.Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the third biggest US oil and gas company and second biggest US refiner, said in an interview with the Financial Times refiners were only “breaking even” despite the outcry over rising petrol prices.The university study reveals that if the price of petrol followed that of crude oil, petrol should have risen to $3.68 a gallon once oil hit $100 a barrel, based on the historical price relationship.Given that crude oil costs usually make up about
60 per cent of fuel prices, there has always been a close correlation between petrol and oil prices. Yet despite oil having risen as high as $119 in recent days, average US petrol prices have remained below $3.68.As a result, margins of refiners have decreased and the cost of crude oil now accounts for 65 to 70 per cent of the price at the pump.The US’s biggest refiner, Valero, has pre-announced first-quarter earnings of between 10 and 35 cents per share, a sharp drop from Credit Suisse Global Energy’s $1.14 estimate.Integrated oil companies, conducting exploration and production as well as refining and marketing, are better shielded from the inability to raise petrol prices further. ConocoPhillips reported a first-quarter net income of $4.1bn (€2.6bn, £2.1bn) yesterday, but only $520m in net income for its refining and marketing segment, down from $1.1bn in the first quarter of 2007.In addition to sagging petrol demand, Credit Suisse’s US equity research team says refinery margins are also under pressure because of the introduction of ethanol into the US market.If petrol prices continue to rise, analysts expect demand to fall further, leaving refiners with oversupply. According to Mr Mulva, some refiners have already stopped “some runs” because they judge the market to have excess supply.Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at the Baker Institute, says that in the past couple of years rising prices have begun to have an impact on US demand, resulting in the average annual consumption increase falling sharply from the previous decade. From 2003 to 2004, US petrol consumption rose 1.9 per cent, but increased only 0.6 per cent from 2004 to 2005 and
1 per cent from 2005 to 2006. Preliminary data for 2007 indicate demand rose 0.5 per cent from 2006 to 2007.This month, oil companies were called to hearings in Congress to explain the record price rises.
● Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, yesterday called on the White House to temporarily stop sending crude oil to the nation’s emergency stockpile, Reuters reports from Washington.The White House has resisted calls to stop deliveries to the reserve, saying they have a minimal effect on prices and are a necessary buffer against supply disruptions. Ms Pelosi said suspending deliveries would cut pump prices by five to 24 cents per gallon."
546;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-24T16:14:24Z;ConocoPhillips suffers low refining margins;;ConocoPhillips, the US’ third largest oil and gas company, said its first-quarter results were hit by lower margins in its refining and marketing segment, as petrol prices failed to keep pace with rising crude oil prices.Despite a better-than-expected overall financial result, of $4.1bn, or $2.62 per share, up from $3.6bn, or $2.12 per share, for the year-earlier quarter, the company’s refining segment suffered the effect of US petrol prices well below expectations, in addition to lower volumes on operational problems, unplanned downtime and asset dispositions.Conoco’s refining and marketing segment reported net income of $520m, down from $1.1bn in the year-earlier quarter.Even as the price of crude oil, which comprises 60 per cent of the price of petrol at the pump, continued to rise, petrol prices did not keep pace in the US, where Conoco is the second biggest refiner, given already flat-to-dropping demand for petrol on above average crude oil prices and a slowing economy.Nonethelesss, Credit Suisse Global Energy, said Conoco’s above average exposure to diesel is likely to have helped, given the relative strength of diesel to gasoline in the period. The research group called the results “a credible performance in one of the worst quarters of recent years”.Valero, the US’ biggest refiner, is expected to register the impact of falling petrol margins when it reports on Tuesday, as are ExxonMobil and Chevron, which will report at the end of next week.Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, said that while margins should improve in the second quarter, he expects “continued negative pressure from crude costs”.The company’s exploration and production segment provided net income of $2.9bn, up from $2.3bn in the year-earlier quarter on the rising oil prices. Analysts aid that included a better contribution than expected from its Lukoil investments, which are “difficult to model”. Conoco’s 20 per cent holding in that Russian oil and gas group yielded net income of $710m, up from $256m in the year-earlier quarter.He pledged to share repurchases of between $2bn to $3bn for the second quarter, which is in line with Conoco’s plans to spend $10bn on share buybacks this year.The oil majors have been committing billions of dollars toward share buybacks in recent years, as investment opportunities have grown increasingly constrained by nationalism in oil-rich nations limiting their prospects. The shortage of talent and supplies in the energy industry, ramping up to take advantage of high oil prices and the move into alternative energy, has also contributed to investment constraints.
547;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-22T21:25:19Z;ConocoPhillips nears Abu Dhabi deal;;ConocoPhillips expects to announce in the “next month or two’’ that it will be working on Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s $10bn sour gas project.“We’re working very hard on this project,’’ Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, told the Financial Times. “Hopefully there will be an announcement that we will be working together in the next month or two.’’The contract has been under negotiations for months, with Royal Dutch Shell and Occidental Petroleum reported as front contenders at the end of last year. However, in recent months Occidental has been advised it is not a finalist.Winning the gas contract would be a boon at a time when international oil companies, such as Conoco, are having difficulties accessing new resources amid growing nationalism in oil-rich countries.High oil prices have made the project economic and United Arab Emirates is looking to international oil companies to help, given the experience they have with such difficult projects.Much of the gas will be used to meet the increasing needs of the United Arab Emirates amid its rapid economic development.The country is estimated to have more than 200 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, making it the world’s fifth-largest holder of gas reserves. Securing this contract would put Conoco in a strong position to win others in the UAE.Mr Mulva’s comments are the furthest Conoco has gone to confirm still officially unconfirmed reports from the UAE that it was going to get the contract.And while Mr Mulva would not say specifically that Conoco had won the contract, his comments reflect unconfirmed reports by the UAE that the company was in the final running.“We expect to be working with Adnoc,’’ Mr Mulva said. “It’s an important project for Adnoc, and it’s an important project for ourselves.’’Separately, Mr Mulva would not give specific details about talks in another part of the world, Venezuela, where it took a $4.5bn writeoff last year after the government seized control of its assets in a nationalisation of the energy sector. The company is attempting to recover those losses.“We’re trying to determine the value of the investment made,’’ Mr Mulva said. Once Conoco and Caracas agree to the value, he said, they can determine how the country could reimburse Conoco.“I’m always an optimist,’’ Mr Mulva said. “I would like it sorted in 2008.’’During the interim, Conoco continues to buy oil from Venezuela, where Mr Mulva routinely meets officials in what he describes as a “very cordial relationship’’.
548;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-15T20:47:44Z;US stocks edge up in volatile session;;"Wall Street stocks climbed on Tuesday for the first time in three days as advances by financial and energy companies offset declines in healthcare stocks in a temperamental session of trading.The S&P 500 financials index swung between gains and losses but by mid-
afternoon bank and brokerage stocks had recovered thanks to a rare spot of good news from a pair of regional banks.Regions Financial, the biggest bank in Alabama, and M&T Bank, part-owned by Berkshire Hathaway, said gains from selling their stakes in Visa and increased fee income had enhanced first-quarter results.Regions shares rose 8.4 per cent to $20.12 while M&T added 6.3 per cent to $85.86, pushing broader indices into the black.That news helped offset revelations that State Street, the money manager for institutions, could be forced to bail out a number of mortgage-backed debt funds, or “conduits”, that have already incurred $1.49bn in unrealised mark-to-market losses. State Street fell 9.9 per cent to $69.23 after rising as much as 4 per cent earlier in the day after the company had reported a 69 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings.“If you are looking to see if we have turned a corner with financials, then the answer is probably no,” said Thomas Nyheim vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust. “They are going to keep coming out with mixed numbers, but it seems to be priced into the market.”The financials sector was among the leading gainers in the broader S&P 500, with the financials index up 1.1 per cent, snapping a five-day losing streak.Throughout the day the markets struggled to find a clear direction as investors were hit with a raft of conflicting data including reports showing rising inflation, stabilising manufacturing activity in New York state and a slightly more optimistic outlook among homebuilders.By the close, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,334.44.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,286.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also added 0.5 per cent, to 12,362.47.Still, the S&P 500 has fallen in four out of the past six sessions, as a string of disappointing first-quarter earnings results from the likes of Wachovia, and expectations of worse to come, weighed on investor confidence.Markets started on Tuesday in a positive mood after better-than-expected results from healthcare sector bellwether Johnson & Johnson.The group’s profits jumped in the first quarter, breaking the run of bad earnings news from major US corporations that has undermined sentiment in the past two weeks.But the results left investors largely unmoved once trading began and the shares fell 0.1 per cent to $65.65 while an index of healthcare stocks fell 0.2 per cent.Technology companies also suffered after a series of earnings downgrades by analysts worried that a slowdown will hit profits. An index of technology stocks shed as much as 0.9 per cent before rallying towards the close.Computer component makers EMC and Emulex led the fallers, dropping 3.2 per cent to $14.17 and 6.3 per cent to $12.74 respectively after Citigroup downgraded the stocks.Cisco and IBM also lost ground, falling 0.9 per cent to $23.11 and 0.1 per cent to $117.17 respectively.First-quarter results from Intel, the leading semiconductor manufacturer and industry bellwether, should help reassure investors spooked by disappointing results from arch-rival AMD last week however. Intel said profits fell 12 per cent to $1.44bn but first quarter sales rose 9.3 per cent to $9.67bn. The shares fell 0.9 per cent to $20.75 in after-hours trading.Record oil prices and buoyant commodity prices lifted oil producers, material stocks and wider indices. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips added 1.2 per cent to $90.80 and 1.8 per cent to $81.24 respectively.Airline companies, however, fared poorly as analysts and investors worried that rising fuel costs would eat up any benefits from recent moves to consolidate the industry.Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines jumped in pre-market trading after they agreed to a $3.63bn merger, but by the close Delta shares were down 12.6 per cent to $9.66. Northwest fell 8.4 per cent to $10.28."
549;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-14T20:55:05Z;Financials lead Wall St lower;;Wall Street stocks fell on Monday as sagging financial stocks, depressed by news of unexpected first-quarter losses at Wachovia, overshadowed advances in the energy sector.After a downbeat morning session in which the S&P 500 fell as much as 0.5 per cent, markets found some positive momentum on the back of rising commodity prices.An index of energy stocks rose 1.8 per cent led by coal and oil companies.Consol Energy rose 4.8 per cent to $79.27 while Noble climbed 4.7 per cent to $55.25 and ConocoPhillips added 1.6 per cent to $79.81.Bad news from the financial sector, and expectations of worse to come, prevailed however, and the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,328.27. The S&P 500 has now fallen for four of the past five sessions.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,275.82 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2 to 12,302.06.Leading the way was Wachovia, which swung from a profit to a loss in the first quarter and took a writedown of $2.8bn. It said it would raise $7bn in capital and slashed its quarterly dividend in response. Shares in the bank tumbled 8.1 per cent to $25.55.Meanwhile, Federated Investors, the asset manager, said first-quarter earnings rose 10 per cent, but that still missed consensus estimates. Federated slipped 3.2 per cent to $33.09.The news dragged down other financial stocks, including National City and First Horizon, which fell 10.5 per cent to $7.56 and 11.1 per cent to $11.65 respectively.According to Thomson Financial, first-quarter earnings in the financial sector are expected to fall 64 per cent in the first quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of negative earnings growth.Financials are likely to remain in focus as a number of major banks and brokerages, including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, report results towards the end of the week.Analysts have repeatedly cut their earnings expectations for Citi and Merrill, and the pair are predicted to report losses in the first quarter and writedowns of more than $10bn and $7bn respectively.Such results could further damage already fragile confidence in the sector. Financial stocks have now fallen 10 per cent from their highs after the rescue of Bear Stearns.Citigroup shares slid 3.6 per cent to $22.51, Merrill dropped 1.8 per cent to $42.88 while an index of financial stocks lost 2.5 per cent.The earnings season began last week with a lacklustre set of results from Alcoa, the aluminium producer, and has continued in that vein.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said: “Early signs are awful . . . We expect generally disappointing results and a swathe of lowered profit guidance that will drive the S&P 500 lower in coming weeks.”After a downbeat report from United Parcel Service hit markets mid-week, on Friday General Electric delivered the coup de grâce, missing its targets for the first time in five years.GE shares tumbled 12.8 per cent, the most since the crash in 1987, and dragged the S&P to its lowest close in more than a month. GE fell again on Monday, edging down 0.9 per cent to $31.75.Still, pockets of good news helped the industrial sector hold its own. Eaton, the industrial manufacturer, raised its profit target for 2008 after first-quarter earnings beat expectations. It rose 1.4 per cent to $80.03.WW Grainger, the building supplies distributor, beat first-quarter estimates and raised its 2008 earnings forecast, sending its shares up 2.2 per cent to $81.73.Ryder System, the trucking company, also received a boost after it agreed to buy Gator Leasing, a Miami-based rival, for an undisclosed sum. Ryder climbed 2.6 per cent to $62.18.This week should fill out the picture as nine Dow components and 65 S&P 500 companies release results.Deal activity remains a potential bright spot for investors hunkering down for a stormy earnings season. On Monday, Blockbuster said it would take an unsolicited bid of up to $1.4bn for Circuit City Stores directly to shareholders.Circuit City shares jumped as much as 47 per cent before easing back to $4.97, up 27.4 per cent, as analysts questioned the logic of the deal. Blockbuster shares fell 10.2 per cent to $2.81.
550;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-08T13:46:24Z;Rosneft;;"What’s not to like about Rosneft? The Russian company is one of very few majors worldwide capable of extracting oil cheaply, increasing production volumes and generating oodles of cash in the process. Output should rise by about 5 per cent this year and next with no acquisitions, putting Rosneft on a par with Brazil’s Petrobras, investors’ favourite emerging market growth story.Yet Rosneft has traded more or less sideways since listing in July 2006. In euro terms, its market capitalisation has fallen. Far from keeping pace with the likes of Petrobras and Petrochina (both also state-controlled), it has moved roughly in line with Repsol. Rosneft’s valuation multiples – similar to ConocoPhillips – suggest a mature integrated company struggling to grow the top and bottom line.The company’s 2007 figures, announced on Tuesday, hardly fit that picture. The company raised output in the fourth quarter while achieving a rise of almost 20 per cent in selling margins. Debt worries – the company needs to refinance $10bn by year-end – and rouble appreciation are inadequate explanations for the valuation lag.The real problem is still one of image. Disclosure is basic, to say the least, as are governance standards. Three-quarters owned by the government, Rosneft holds another 10 per cent in treasury shares that it picked off from the remains of Yukos over a year ago; strictly speaking, it should have cancelled or sold them by now. A lack of research and equity sales coverage, outside of Russian banks, compounds the problem. The lack of support from international institutions makes the share price fragile. Two of the largest, Deutsche Bank and Julius Baer, have been heavy sellers in the last six months.It is clear that the Kremlin sees Rosneft as its chosen vehicle to create a world-beating oil major. Winning westerners’ affections will be quite another matter.Post and read comments on this Lex"
551;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-02T20:51:33Z;Wall St eases back in choppy session;;Wall Street stocks eased back in choppy session on Wednesday as investors took profits after Tuesday’s rally and digested a cautious view of the US economy from the Federal Reserve’s chairman.In testimony before congress Ben Bernanke alternately spooked and soothed, noting that the economy may contract in the first half but saying that it was unlikely that any other investment bank would require a Bear Stearns-like rescue. Still, traders and analysts noted that the market reaction was relatively muted after significant advances a day earlier and before crucial employment data due on Friday.Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets, said: “We had a huge run Tuesday and I think it is a normal to retrace some of the gains we saw.” He added that surging oil prices late in the day had also dented equities.But fuel and commodity concerns were both the villain and the hero of the piece, knocking the broader markets but boosting energy and basic materials stocks.Exxon Mobil rose 1.7 per cent to $88.52 while ConocoPhillips climbed 1.4 per cent to $78.77.Gold producers Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining also rallied, adding 2.2 per cent to $99.73 and 3.3 per cent to $46.25 respectively.In New York the benchmark S&P 500 closed down for the first time in three days, dropping 0.2 per cent to 1,367.53 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,361.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 12,608.92.On Tuesday stock markets around the world bounced back from a dismal first quarter on news that several banks had taken further big writedowns on risky assets and were moving to recapitalise.That momentum stalled early on Wednesday during Mr Bernanke’s testimony to Congress on US economic growth and amid a welter of poor economic current and predictive data.The International Monetary Fund slashed its forecasts for growth in the US, adding that there was a 25 per cent chance of a global recession, while the Commerce Department released data showing further weakness in manufacturing.Financials ended down for the day. An index of investment banks fell 0.3 per cent while the broader S&P500 index of financial stocks lost 0.7 per cent. But there were pockets of resilience. Citigroup added 0.8 per cent to $24.02 while Morgan Stanley rose 0.5 per cent to $49.09.Consumer discretionary stocks also found some unexpected impetus, led by department store chain Dillards, after it made a deal with a group of shareholders that would allow it to avoid a proxy fight. Dillards shares, which have lost 38 per cent of their value over the last year, climbed 14.5 per cent, to $21.08. Family Dollar Stores, another retail chain, rose 2.3 per cent to $21.40 while JC Penney gained for a third day – 2 per cent to $40.91.Homebuilders were also boosted after top US Senators agreed on Tuesday to try to pass legislation that could help some homeowners avoid foreclosure. Centex added 0.8 per cent to $26.01, KB Home gained 4 per cent to $28 and DR Horton rose 0.5 per cent to $17.16.Mr Bernanke’s statements also overshadowed better than forecast results from Best Buy and news that private sector jobs increased unexpectedly in March.Best Buy, the consumer electronics and entertainment software retailer, said profits fell 3 per cent to $737m in the fourth quarter.However analysts had been expecting greater declines and revenues proved resilient, climbing 4 per cent to $13.42bn.Best Buy shares rose 1.8 per cent to $44.24, while smaller rival Circuit City, gained 5.7 per cent to $4.65.A report by ADP, the payroll services firm, also cushioned falls after it suggested private sector jobs had climbed in March .But the decline in factory orders hit consumer staple and industrial stocks in spite of some positive news.Caterpillar lost 1.8 per cent to $78.51 despite of announcing that it would increase prices for its machinery by up to 5 per cent, while General Electric dropped 1.1 per cent to $38.02.Walgreen, the retail drugstore chain, fell 2 per cent to $38.14 despite revealing that total sales rose 10.6 per cent to $5.11bn in March, compared to last year.
552;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
553;COP;Conocophillips;2008-04-02T19:55:39Z;Taxing Big Oil;;It is becoming a ritual: petrol prices rise and the oil industry is hauled before Congress for a kicking.Six years into the oil bull market, Washington still struggles to frame a coherent response. President George W. Bush’s surprise at a recent briefing, when one journalist helpfully informed him that petrol might soon reach the unheard-of price of $4 a gallon, spoke volumes.Politicians have belatedly raised vehicle fuel efficiency standards. But they are reluctant to do more for fear of limiting consumers’ choice about what cars they can drive. “Big oil” makes a much easier target. The five majors testifying on Tuesday – ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and BP – made a collective net profit of more than $120bn last year.A consistent line of attack is the call to remove industry tax breaks. Besides government figures showing oil companies paid in effect a tax rate of 41 per cent in 2006 – about double that for the manufacturing sector – higher taxes would actually be counterproductive to helping consumers. US energy officials reckon that 69 per cent of the cost of an average gallon of petrol relates to the cost of crude oil.Record crude prices result more from Chinese demand interacting with geopolitics than any “Big oil” conspiracy. The weak dollar does not help either. Higher taxes at a time when the majors are already struggling to increase output would merely serve to push up oil prices further by raising the hurdle for new upstream projects.There is no escaping the fact that, even as alternatives are being developed, oil will remain a dominant energy source for a while yet. New production, where possible, ought to be actively encouraged. And if Washington really wants to do something about $4 petrol, it would do well to make tougher choices on energy conservation.Post and read comments on this Lex
554;COP;Conocophillips;2008-03-19T20:43:04Z;Wall St falls as oil and gold prices drop;;US stocks gave back much of their recent gains towards the end of the session on Wednesday as markets were dragged down by energy and mining stocks amid tumbling commodity prices.Some of the largest US oil companies were among the fallers after oil experienced its biggest one-day drop since 1991.Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips fell 4.6 per cent to $84.43, 4.9 per cent to $81.89 and 6 per cent to $73.61 respectively.With gold prices also off recent highs, Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, two of the top US gold producers, dropped 7.2 per cent to $46.03 and 3.6 per cent to $49.06.The benchmark S&P 500 index – which recorded its biggest one day gain in five years on Tuesday – closed down 2.4 per cent at 1,298.42 points, while the Nasdaq composite index was down 2.6 per cent at 2,209.96 points.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.4 per cent to 12,099.66. Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said: “We had a pretty good start to the day and were holding yesterday’s [Tuesday’s] levels for most of the morning but as time ticks on people get a little nervous and they think ‘I want to lock in some profit now’.”Indeed, falling oil and mining stocks wiped out early gains sparked by reassuring results from Morgan Stanley and news that regulators had cleared Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pump money into the embattled US mortgage market.Morgan Stanley shares rose as high as $47.07 in early trading before dropping back to $43.45, up 1.4 per at the close.The broader financial sector, which helped drive the benchmark S&P 500 index up 4.2 per cent on Tuesday, fell back amid renewed concerns about the fragility of the banking sector.An index of investment bank stocks, which had rallied in recent days, fell back 5.4 per cent, while the broader index of S&P 500 financials fell 2 per cent.At the epicentre of the sell off was Merrill Lynch, with shares falling 11.11 per cent to $42.52, after the bank sued XL Capital Assurance to prevent the bond insurer from canceling $3.1bn of credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations.Lehman Brothers also gave back some of its gains on Tuesday, dropping 9.2 per cent to $42.23 after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said the bank could be exposed to further writedowns.Investors in Clear Channel, the largest US radio company, were spooked by reports that its buy-out by two private equity firms may be delayed due to difficulties in financing the $21bn in loans needed to complete the deal.Clear Channel shares were among the leading fallers in the S&P, dropping 8.9 per cent to $32.60.Rebecca Engmann Darst, an equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers, said the sell-off in financials could be due to news that brokerages were selling leveraged buy-out debt at reduced prices and “underlying skittishness” in the market.However, falls were cushioned somewhat by news that regulators have allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to inject $200 billion into the struggling housing market. The government-chartered mortgage company’s shares surged 8.8 per cent to $30.71 and 14.9 per cent to $29.90.Elsewhere in the mortgage market, shares in Thornburg, a specialist in “Jumbo” mortgages which is struggling to meet margin calls, plummeted 49.66 per cent to $1.50.On Tuesday the shares spiked on news that Thornburg’s lenders had agreed to freeze demands for more collateral until 2009, but on Wednesday the company revealed the tough terms of the deal.Thornburg agreed to give five lenders warrants equivalent to about a 27 per cent stake in the company and committed to raise at least $948m within seven days by issuing senior notes.In corporate news, Visa, the world’s largest credit card network, began trading on Wednesday and its shares soared as high as $69 before falling back to close at $56.50, up 28.4 per cent.On Wednesday the San Francisco-based company raised more than $17.9bn after selling 406m shares for $44 each – $2 higher than top estimates in the prospectus.In technology, Adobe Systems, the maker of design software, led the sector higher after first-quarter profit beat consensus estimates.The shares rose 9 per cent to $34.75
555;COP;Conocophillips;2008-03-10T22:29:03Z;Venezuela’s oil belt reopens to private groups;;Less than a year since president Hugo Chávez seized control of the vast oil fields in Venezuela’s Orinoco belt, executives from international energy companies are back, armed with smiles, pens and cordial handshakes.US oil groups ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips spurned the compensation offered by Caracas, preferring to fight it out in the courts – Exxon is awaiting a ruling in London this week. But France’s Total, Norway’s Statoil­Hydro and Italy’s Eni have signed potentially significant new deals.Eni’s deal to develop an area of the Orinoco belt could be worth more than $4bn (€2.6bn, £2bn) and there may be more tie-ups in the offing.“Venezuela has oil, and plenty of it. As long as there is a window of opportunity for a company to operate and make some profits, greed will always win through,” says Roger Tissot at PFC Energy, the consultancy.Despite the president’s hardball tactics, Venezuela’s enormous reserves – by some measures the largest in the world, with more than 300bn barrels recoverable – seem too good an opportunity to miss. In a context of record high oil prices that show no signs of falling, companies may be willing to take the gamble.PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, certainly needs help and international oil groups may be its best option, particularly in the short term. In turn, Mr Chávez needs PDVSA: he depends on Venezuela’s abundant oil wealth to bankroll his socialist revolution as he struggles with an unstable economy riddled with distortions that cause problems such as inflation and shortages.PDVSA has set itself the ambitious goal of almost doubling production by 2012, from over 3m barrels a day – according to official data that even government figures privately question – to almost 6m. However, most analysts say this target is unrealistic.“Undoubtedly, PDVSA could never do this alone,” says Mr Tissot.Developing the particularly heavy oil reserves in the Orinoco region involves a complex refining process known as “upgrading”, in which some international oil companies have developed considerable expertise and experience, while most national oil companies have not.“There are areas where PDVSA needs support, and that is what we are here to provide,” says Thore Kristiansen, who runs Statoil­Hydro’s operations in Venezuela.The deals with Total, StatoilHydro and Eni suggest a growing awareness in the Venezuelan government that it needs as many players as possible to maximise the potential of the Orinoco belt. Help from outside is all the more necessary if Mr Chávez is to achieve his aim of reducing dependence on the US oil market.The timing of the deals is indicative of PDVSA’s attempts to prove its willingness to work with private companies, says Patrick Esteruelas at the consultancy Eurasia Group. That image may help it in the legal dispute with Exxon, which is attempting to freeze more than $12bn of PDVSA’s global assets through the British High Court. Exxon argues that the state company does not intend to compensate it fairly.Nevertheless, none of the European companies have yet made big new investments in the Orinoco belt, even if they have secured the possibility of doing so in the future. So far both private and state-owned oil companies operating there have committed themselves only to certifying reserves – which requires minimal investment – rather than to exploring or developing them.“Are the companies committing to work with the Chávez administration despite all the risks attached? Or are they betting on the long haul, hoping to secure a foothold in Venezuela before Chávez is eventually forced to loosen terms for private investment, or should he be replaced by a more market-friendly administration?” asks Mr Esteruelas.
556;COP;Conocophillips;2008-03-09T18:13:17Z;US airlines pressed on climate change;;US airline companies are facing shareholder resolutions on climate change for the first time this year.This reflects the spread of investor concerns over environmental risks, which were previously focused largely on the power and energy ­sectors.US Airways and SouthWest Airlines are both facing resolutions that call on them to report on strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.A similar resolution against Continental Airlines has been withdrawn, after the company agreed to respond.The airlines join retailers such as Best Buy, RiteAid and Kroger and home building companies Standard Pacific and Centex, which are also being asked to give details of their efforts to assess and reduce their output of greenhouse gas.The resolutions are among 54 climate change-related resolutions filed by investors this year.This is more than double the number filed two years ago, according to Mindy Lubber of Ceres, a non-profit partnership of investors and environmental groups.“The bottom line is the growing interest in investors and their need for this kind of information …investors need this information in order to make smart investment decisions,” said Ms Lubber.Calstrs, the powerful California teachers’ retirement fund, has also filed its first climate-change resolutions this year.These are aimed at Dynegy, the power company, and Oneok.ConocoPhillips and Chevron, the oil and gas companies, are also facing new resolutions reflecting concern about the environmental impact of oil sands mining in Canada.Citigroup will face a resolution calling on it to end financing of “mountain top removal” coal mining, and for coal-fired power plant projects.Bank of America won approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject a similar proposal.More than a dozen of the resolutions have been withdrawn so far, after companies responded to the issues raised.Four have been blocked by the SEC in response to company claims that they had interfered in “ordinary business”.Last year, 43 similar shareholder resolutions secured an average 21 per cent of shareholders’ votes.Laura Shaffer, of the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which has filed resolutions, calling on US homebuilders to report on efforts to increase energy efficiency in their houses, said the sector had yet to respond to concerns about the environment.“At this point the industry as a whole is not doing so much disclosure,” she said.In September, 11 state institutional investors joined a petition calling on the SEC to require companies to report regularly on how climate change may affect their business.
557;COP;Conocophillips;2008-03-02T18:42:55Z;Gas is key to future growth of oil groups;;"The world’s international oil groups are turning to gas for future growth after increasingly being blocked by national companies from pursuing oil opportunities.Gas-centred deals such as Chevron’s 2005 acquisition of Unocal, ConocoPhillips’ 2006 purchase of Burlington Resources and Eni’s buy-out of Dominion’s assets in the Gulf of Mexico last year underline the change in strategy.The shift is forcing large oil companies to adapt their approach to the business that has generated the bulk of their profits for more than a century.As state-owned oil groups have taken control of more than 80 per cent of the world’s oil reserves, the share of gas in international companies’ reserves has expanded from 39.5 per cent in 2003 to 44 per cent in 2006, according to a report by PFC Energy, the consultancy.International oil companies dominate big parts of the gas value chain, and are still being sought after as partners for new projects in countries ranging from Qatar to Iran.“Gas is the segment where the international oil companies are still indispensable,” said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy.According to PFC, international companies or utilities own 49 per cent of the world’s liquefaction capacity, both existing and under construction, and 72 per cent of its re-gasification capacity.Nikos Tsafos, analyst in PFC’s Global Gas Group, said international groups have an edge in gas because of the specialised technology and project management skills required for the massive projects involved; the reassurance they provided bankers in projects costing $10bn to $20bn; and their access to markets.National companies have the cash and skills to manage many conventional oil projects, allowing them to force international groups into minority positions – or completely out of projects they would have once dominated.But even Venezuela, which has taken a hardline position on the nationalisation of its oil projects, still looks to international companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips for help on gas export projects.Only Algeria and Libya have liquefied natural gas projects wholly owned by their national oil companies.John Gass, president of Chevron’s Global Gas group, said natural gas is projected to be among the fastest growing segments of the Chevron energy portfolio. Chevron owns the biggest natural gas resources in Australia, and has significant holdings in west Africa, Asia, the Caspian region and Latin America.“The natural gas business we’re building today will shape what Chevron looks like 10 years from now,” he said.Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said US energy policy should include expanding the role of natural gas, noting much of the US potential for natural gas lies in areas off-limits. Such restricted areas run from the Rocky Mountains to Alaska."
558;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Italy’s Eni to invest $4bn in Venezuela;;"Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, plans to invest $4bn in Venezuela, making the biggest commitment by a western oil company since President Hugo Chávez began to take control of the country’s oil projects in 2005.Eni has reached agreement in principle with PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, to develop an area of the Orinoco belt – on some measures the world’s largest oil reserve.The investment would expose Eni to the risk of further expropriation by Mr Chávez, while giving it access to Venezuela’s huge reserves ahead of its European and US competitors.Paolo Scaroni, Eni’s chief executive, and Rafael Ramírez, Venezuela’s energy minister, were expected to sign the deal in Caracas last night, in the presence of Mr Chávez and Massimo D’Alema, Italy’s foreign ­minister.The deal is the most concrete sign yet of Venezuela’s enthusiasm for foreign investment to revive its ailing oil industry.It also reflects Eni’s strategy of being among the first big oil companies to invest in politically risky countries. It is, for example, the biggest international oil company in Libya, where it has operated since 1959.Eni has only just resolved its dispute with Venezuela over the Dacion oil field, where the government took control in 2006. Venezuela forced Eni to accept a settlement worth $700m – less than the asset’s book value – before it would agree to the new investment plan.On Friday PDVSA was in court in London, trying to lift an order, secured by ExxonMobil in January, that froze an estimated $12bn of assets in connection with a dispute over Venezuela’s Cerro Negro heavy oil project, pending arbitration proceedings in New York.Exxon walked away from the project after Venezuela moved to take control last year. The court is expected to rule on the issue next week.Mr Chávez’s government has been keen to sign deals with other western oil companies in an attempt to show that Exxon and ConocoPhillips, which also walked away from its heavy oil project last year, are isolated in the industry.Other western oil companies, including StatoilHydro, Total and Royal Dutch Shell, have recently signed up preliminary agreements to look at possible investment opportunities in Venezuela.Total, for example, last month signed two joint study agreements with PDVSA to look at reserves in another area of the Orinoco belt.Eni’s plans are much more advanced, however. It hopes to begin production at a rate of 30,000 barrels per day in 2010, and step up to 300,000 b/d by 2014.In a statement, Eni said it would conduct joint studies of the area with PDVSA, and “upon the successful completion of the joint studies…the award of the prospective area to a PDVSA-Eni joint venture will be requested and the development plan will then be sanctioned.”The project would conform to the new contract terms imposed by Mr Chavez, giving PDVSA 60 per cent, and Eni 40 per cent of the joint venture. Its total investment cost has been estimated at $10bn, including the upgrading of a plant to convert the heavy oil of the Orinoco Belt into crude that can be sold on world markets. Eni’s share would be $4bn.The deal gives Eni access to resources estimated at 2.5bn-3bn barrels of oil,
adding about 10 per cent to the company’s resource base. Eni’s proven reserves under the definition used by the US Securities and Exchange Commission are about 7bn barrels of oil equivalent.David Thomson of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, said that although there was undoubtedly political risk in Venezuela, “there is an incredible amount of oil down there.” He added: “It is heavy oil, so it is expensive to get it out. But with the oil price remaining so robust, it is a very big prize to win.”"
559;COP;Conocophillips;2008-02-10T18:23:36Z;Venezuela plays down Exxon’s assets freezes;;Rafael Ramirez, Venezuela’s energy minister, on Friday rejected concerns that PDVSA, the state oil company, would be affected by attempts by ExxonMobil to freeze assets worth $12bn.Exxon won court orders on Thursday in the UK, the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles to freeze PDVSA’s global assets in an attempt to secure compensation for operations lost to President Hugo Chavez’s nationalisation drive last year.“This does not affect our cash flow or our operations at all. We are operating at 100 per cent, and there are no direct consequences for our assets,” said Mr Ramirez, after PDVSA’s dollar-denominated bonds suffered their steepest fall in six months.Last year, Exxon walked away from projects worth up to $2.3bn in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt, which is believed to contain the world’s largest deposits of extra-heavy crude oil. This came after the group failed to reach an agreement over its revised contract when PDVSA announced it would increase its stake to a majority.According to Patrick Esteruelas, an analyst at Eurasia Group, if the court orders are upheld, PDVSA’s ability to raise finance for ambitious investment plans and growing spending obligations could be limited.PDVSA’s debt jumped from $3bn to $16bn last year amid concerns that it was suffering a cash shortage because of Mr Chavez’s use of its financial resources for political ends.Exxon’s move could also complicate PDVSA’s strategy of selling overseas refining assets, after it divested some owned by its subsidiary Citgo in the US last year. PDVSA still has stakes in 14 refineries in the US, Europe and the Caribbean worth about $15bn.The legal challenge will set a precedent for companies seeking compensation from PDVSA over the Orinoco projects. Conoco­Phillips abandoned assets worth up to $7.2bn last year, filing for international arbitration in November, shortly after Exxon.ConocoPhillips said it was continuing to discuss a resolution specific to the assets that were expropriated.The four other companies operating in the Orinoco – US-based Chevron, the UK’s BP, French group Total and Norway’s StatoilHydro – accepted the revised terms.
560;COP;Conocophillips;2008-02-04T08:32:38Z;Liquid assets;;That’s the banks dealt with, so what next for sovereign funds? How about oil? Sovereign wealth funds have been busy pumping money into western financial institutions – at least $80bn over the past 12 months. But the sovereign stash is estimated to be at least $2,000bn and counting. Further rescues of banks may well be on the cards but the funds must also look elsewhere for other opportunities.The energy sector is one of the largest and most liquid in the equity markets of the industrialised world. It constitutes 12.4 per cent of the S&P 500, ranking third behind IT and the much-diminished financials. Sovereign funds could deploy large sums in oil stocks without reaching significant stakes. Buying 5 per cent of just the top three US majors – ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips – would cost a cool $39bn.Sovereign funds hailing from the Persian Gulf make the likeliest potential buyers. To say they have some familiarity with the sector would be an understatement. Western majors trade at stock prices implying a long-term oil price in the mid-$50s per barrel. If you are a sovereign fund within Opec, your government is doing its utmost to keep crude well above that level. Meanwhile, the majors, struggling to stay relevant in a world of rampant resource nationalism, might welcome anything that holds out the prospect of better access to Middle Eastern reserves. It could even underpin a re-rating of their stock.What about politicians? Even if they have not moved on since China’s CNOOC was blocked from buying Unocal of the US in 2005, the world has. It would be hard to justify welcoming sovereign cash to shore up the western banking system while simultaneously preventing it from buying small stakes in oil companies. Some backlash is inevitable. But it may be possible to offset this by, say, making better access to projects an explicit condition of the investment. Alternatively, structures other than straight equity stakes could be considered – what about a joint investment vehicle backed by sovereign cash with a western major managing it as a general partner?In any case, a large portion of the west’s oil industry was built originally by exploiting opportunities with the help of government backing – often in the Gulf countries themselves. The injection of state capital from these now forbidden drilling grounds would merely bring the process full circle.Post and read comments on this Lex
561;COP;Conocophillips;2008-01-23T23:07:16Z;StatoilHydro to step up Venezuela operations;;StatoilHydro, Norway’s national oil company, signed a deal with Venezuela on Wednesday to step up operations in the oil-rich Orinoco Belt.Two US oil majors walked away last year from multibillion-dollar projects in the region over disagreements with the government.StatoilHydro is to quantify the reserves of the Junin 10 block in the Orinoco Belt, possibly the largest deposit of extra-heavy crude oil in the world, with the possibility of developing them.Thore Kristiansen, who runs StatoilHydro operations in Venezuela, said: “We see enormous reserves potential in Venezuela”.Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s president, says he wants the reserves certification process under way in the Orinoco Belt to be complete by 2010. He hopes this will boost reserves from 100bn barrels to more than 300bn, more than any other country.StatoilHydro has a 9.7 per cent stake in a nearby block, Petrocedeño (formerly Sincor), which Mr Kristiansen said was producing roughly 200,000 barrels per day.He said: “If Junin 10 proves to have reserves of the magnitude of Petrocedeño, there is huge potential”.ExxonMobil and ConocoPhilips walked away from projects in the Orinoco Belt last year. They refused to agree to new terms after state-owned PDVSA, announced it would increase its stake in their projects, choosing instead to file for international arbitration.StatoilHydro, Chevron, Total and BP accepted the terms.Industry analysts say Venezuela is in desperate need of foreign investment and expertise. PDVSA has been struggling since a damaging strike five years ago resulted in the loss of many of its most experienced and qualified employees. Meanwhile, its financial resources are stretched as Mr Chávez is diverting a large portion of oil income towards social programmes.Following the government’s decision to take a controlling stake in all oil projects, many analysts are expecting a similar move this year in the gas sector. StatoilHydro has recently completed exploring Block 4 of the Plataforma Deltana, an offshore gas field.Mr Kristiansen – who explained that the development stage was still some way off – said: “We have not been informed of any changes to our contract,.“Before we make any decisions concerning development, the legal, fiscal and commercial framework needs to be clarified. This will take some time.”
562;COP;Conocophillips;2008-01-23T16:18:14Z;Conoco lifted by high commodities prices;;ConocoPhillips on Wednesday set the tone for strong financial results from the major oil companies over the next two weeks.But the numbers masked the dilemma in which Conoco and other international oil companies find themselves, with limited access to resources and an unclear path for investment.High commodity prices enabled the US’s third largest oil and gas company to report fourth-quarter net income of $4.4bn, or $2.71 per share, up from $3.2bn, or $1.91 per share, in the year-earlier quarter, even as production fell.Daily production averaged 1.84m barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from 2.05m barrels in the fourth quarter of 2006.Conoco, like the other oil majors, has been intent on repurchasing its shares, with $2.5bn of stock purchased in the quarter and $7bn in stock bought during the year.The company expects to spend between $2bn and $3bn on share repurchases during the first quarter.It plans to spend $15.3bn in 2008 on growth strategies as well as increased dividends and continued share repurchases.While this strategy has kept investors engaged, the PFC Energy 50 rankings of the world’s largest listed energy companies, released on Wednesday, reveals that investors are increasingly betting on the long-term growth potential of national oil companies, which rose significantly in this year's rankings.Energy consultants insist international oil companies must shift the emphasis from share repurchases and increase investment if they are to remain relevant in an industry increasingly dominated by national oil companies. These latter now control over 80 per cent of the world's reserves.The international oil majors “have benefited from very high oil prices but that is not going to be sufficient to maintain their growth”, said Rodolfo Guzman, director at Arthur D Little, the consultancy. “I’m sure all of them are struggling at the moment considering which avenue to take to growth.'”Conoco reported net income of $2m in the fourth quarter in its emerging business segment, down from $8m in the year-earlier quarter as it boosted spending on alternative energy programmes.Revenues were $52.7bn, up from $41.5bn a year ago.For 2007, Conoco said net income was $11.9bn, or $7.22 per share – against net income of $15.6bn, or $9.66 per share, for 2006 – after a second-quarter impairment charge of $4.5bn from the expropriation of its Venezuelan oil projects in the nationalisation of energy assets.Full-year revenues were $187.4bn, down from $183.7bn in the previous year.
563;COP;Conocophillips;2008-01-02T23:36:09Z;Oil chiefs told to focus on reinvestment;;Oil’s flirtation with the $100-a-barrel mark will heighten pressure on energy companies to reinvest profits rather than continuing to use them for share buybacks, energy experts said Wednesday.“This year, with $100 oil, is a great year for the chairmen of all the oil companies to think more creatively about how to spend their higher income flows on productive investments,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at the James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy. “By productive investment, I mean investment on: how do I find more oil? How do I access unconventional oil? And ways to make money in alternative energy.”She noted that a recent study by the Baker Institute revealed the Big Five international oil companies have cut exploration spending in real terms between 1998 and 2006, in spite of the rise in oil prices. ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips used 56 per cent of their increased operating cash flow on share buybacks and dividends instead of exploration.“To just say we are opportunity constrained and need to stick our money under the mattress is not an adequate response to higher revenue and $100 oil,” Ms Jaffe said.The international oil companies feel constrained by the reversal of ownership of global oil assets. In 1970, international oil companies controlled 85 per cent of the world’s oil reserves. Today, state-owned oil companies control 80 per cent of those reserves. Oil-rich countries, such as Russia and Venezuela, reacted by raising taxes and royalties, or even blocking access to reserves or taking ownership of projects away from the international oil companies.Nonetheless, Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy, said: “The companies must reinvest and if they can’t, they have a problem.” He said some have hesitated, believing oil was bound to return to $50 or $60 a barrel. “Some don’t believe these prices will hold.’’They also face challenges in the form of rising costs for personnel and parts across the industry. Some prices have gone up more than 100 per cent in recent years, even as government take has been rising in oil-rich countries that want an ever-growing piece of the pie. Nonetheless, Mr West said, international oil companies must focus on reinvestment.“The ability to reinvest is fundamental to the future of these companies,’’ Mr West said. He singled out Chevron for being the boldest for its size. The US’s second-largest oil company recently announced $22.9bn in capital spending in 2008, up 15 per cent from 2007.That is more than ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest public oil company, allotted for this past year. Exxon has not announced its 2008 budget.
564;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BP to review Alaska investment plans;;BP, Europe’s second largest oil company, will review its investment plans in the US state of Alaska following legislation by the state to raise taxes on oil producers there.The move by the state government is a blow to all oil companies doing business in one of the most important oil regions in the world’s third largest oil producer.It is also another piece of bad news for BP, the UK-based oil producer, which is still under investigation by state officials for last year’s oil spill in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, for which it has already paid $20m in fines.Sarah Palin, Alaska’s Republican governor, last week signed the tax rise into law, boosting levies on the net value of oil from 22.5 per cent to 25 per cent. The state government expects to raise $1.5bn in revenues next year from the measure.Oil executives say the measure will almost certainly cause a disruption to investment plans. Doug Suttles, president of BP Exploration Alaska, said he was “disappointed” by the move and hoped the government would reconsider the tax increase once the effect of the measure became clear.He said: “This massive tax increase will weaken investment in Alaska’s oil fields at the very time that more investment is needed …This will impact our business plans in 2008.”The tax rise is the latest blow to international oil companies, which have seen their assets come increasingly under threat by governments in resource-rich countries looking for a greater share of oil revenues.In spite of Alaska’s importance to the US oil industry, local opposition to the oil industry has intensified following allegations of corruption and bribery. This year, two former Alaskan lawmakers were convicted of accepting bribes from oil executives working for Veco, an oilfield services company.Oil companies have been criticised by local politicians for not doing enough to safeguard the environment. This month Alaskan officials began investigating a small oil spill from a pipeline operated by ConocoPhillips.
565;COP;Conocophillips;2007-12-24T08:27:12Z;Jan 15 deadline for Kashagan partners;;Kazakhstan and the group of oil companies led by Eni of Italy have set January 15 as the new deadline for talks over the fate of the disputed Kashagan oilfield, Kazakh energy minister Sauat Mynbayev said on Monday, adding progress is being stalled by Exxon.Kazakhstan and the consortium of oil companies on Friday came close to resolving a dispute over the Kashagan oilfield after all the foreign partners agreed in principle to sell part of their stakes in the project to KazMunaigas, Kazakhstan’s state oil company.The consortium has also agreed to pay the Kazakh government about $4bn to compensate for the delayed start to production and massive cost inflation at the flagship Caspian Sea oil development.However, ExxonMobil, one of the members of the consortium with an 18.5 per cent stake, is holding out for a higher price for any shares it surrenders to KazMunaigas.Exxon was earlier accused by Kazakhstan of blocking a settlement.The company said in a statement that it was “not opposed” to KazMunaigas taking a larger stake in the project but said it was still working with Kazakhstan “to seek an amicable solution on the appropriate value for the equity”.Mr Mynbayev on Monday said Kazakhstan did not like Exxon’s offer. ”Such an approach bears risks for the project,” he told reporters.The consortium of companies working on Kashagan, which is led by Eni of Italy, issued a statement saying “significant steps” had been taken towards settlement during talks leading up to the expiry of a December 20 deadline set by Kazakhstan.The dispute erupted in August after investors handed Kazakhstan a revised development plan for the field, postponing first production by two years until 2010 and doubling the cost of phase one to about $20bn. Separately, Kazakhstan said the full estimated cost of development had ballooned to $136bn from an earlier $57bn.The Eni-led group has agreed that Kazakhstan is entitled to about $4bn of compensation for the setbacks, which have derailed the republic’s plan to triple oil production by 2015.Oil company sources described earlier Kazakh media reports that Kazakhstan would demand $7bn worth of compensation as ”totally unrealistic”.The final size of the payment will be linked to oil prices. Many observers are sceptical that the Eni-led group will be able to meet the revised 2010 schedule for start-up at the field.With the exception of Exxon, all companies in the consortium, which also includes Total, Shell, ConocoPhillips and Inpex of Japan, have agreed a price at which they will sell their shares to KazMunaigas which is seeking to increase its 8.33 per cent stake in Kashagan.Exxon said it and the other consortium members were “working with Kazakhstan to resolve the key issues”. It added: “ExxonMobil is not opposed to KMG increasing its equity and continues to work with Kazakhstan to seek an amicable solution on the appropriate value for the equity.”The Eni group said a final settlement of the Kashagan dispute was expected early in 2008.
566;COP;Conocophillips;2007-11-12T22:00:52Z;Saudi oil chief rejects talk of supply crunch;;"As Saudi Arabia hosts a key oil summit in Riyadh this weekend, its national oil company, Saudi Aramco, has begun testing new facilities in the Khursaniyah field that are expected to raise the kingdom’s production capacity by about 500,000 barrels a day by early next year.The extra capacity will cover almost a quarter of next year’s projected rise in demand, estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA) – the west’s energy watchdog – at 2.1m b/d. For Ali Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, this is proof that fears of an imminent “supply crunch” are inaccurate.The news also reinforces the message from Opec, the oil producers’ cartel, at its summit, which will attempt to underline the reliability of supply and Opec’s concerns about continued world economic growth.Fears that runaway demand from developing nations, particularly China, will outstrip supply from Opec in the medium term are helping to propel oil prices towards $100 a barrel.Those fears were exacerbated last week when the IEA gave warning in its World Energy Outlook that a supply crunch before 2015 was possible.The IEA said that although investment and new production capacity were expected to increase, it was uncertain whether this would be sufficient to offset both the decline in output at existing fields and the projected rise in demand.The agency also cast doubt over the willingness and ability of national oil groups to increase installed capacity, forecasting that Opec would need almost to double its production capacity to about 60.6m b/d by 2030.The chief executives of Total and Conoco, two of the world’s biggest oil companies, have recently expressed concerns that global crude production will never reach 100m b/d.Without making any specific references on Monday, Mr Naimi criticised “pessimists”, saying they were creating a propitious environment for speculators and hedge funds to invest in the oil market and push prices above what was warranted by market fundamentals. The scepticism was “doing a lot of damage to the stability of the market”.Saudi Arabia’s expansion plans would allow the country to increase sharply its exports to China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer. Mr Naimi said the kingdom would ship about 360,000 b/d to two new Chinese refineries next year, an increase of 30 per cent from current levels. “Why are people so pessimistic?” he asked. He pointed out that Saudi Arabia had a production capacity of 11.3m b/d but was pumping only about 9m b/d.“The demand is not there; the customers are not there,” he said, referring to the extra oil.The IEA forecasts that oil demand will hit 87.6m b/d in the fourth quarter of the year – up 2.1m b/d from the third quarter. Without another Opec increase on top of the 500,000 b/d the cartel agreed last September, the IEA fears that crude oil inventories will suffer a larger-than-usual draw.In an attempt to reassure consuming countries, however, Mr Naimi said that Saudi Arabia and other Opec members were thinking about the impact of the oil price on future economic growth.“We are focused on economic growth, particularly of developing countries. We work very hard and consciously to make sure whatever action we take doesn’t dampen economic growth worldwide,” he said.He said Opec did not fear the impact on oil demand from alternative sources of energy, such as biofuels, for the next 10 years. But he felt that the current attempts to stop using fossil fuels were misguided.“We are pragmatic,” he said. “The world will continue to need fossil fuels. If it is damaging the environment, let us apply technology to clean it and continue using them.”"
567;COP;Conocophillips;2007-11-09T04:36:05Z;Resource nationalism: State groups give majors a run for their money;;With the steep rise in oil prices over the past four years, a new group of companies has risen to the fore. National companies, from Saudi Aramco, to Russia’s Gazprom and Venezuela’s PdVSA control about 80 per cent of the world’s oil reserves and 50 per cent of gas reserves, and have become increasingly important as resource nationalism has resurfaced as a global phenomenon.The multinationals that have traditionally dominated oil and gas operations are shut out of some of the world’s most prolific hydrocarbons basins, notably in Saudi Arabia, which expects to entrench its position as the global swing producer of oil by expanding output over the next years. International oil companies everywhere are struggling to pump more from maturing fields elsewhere and are increasingly under pressure from governments, such as Venezuela and Russia, to accept harsher economic terms.Even the biggest international companies, from ExxonMobiland Chevron to BP and Royal Dutch Shell, have seen their profits squeezed by rising industry-wide costs while struggling to book extra reserves. A recent study by John S Herold, an oil and gas research company, and Harrison Lovegrove, an industry advisory group, found spending by 228 global oil and gas companies increased 45 per cent to $401bn in 2006. But reserves grew just 2 per cent.In the meantime, high oil prices have deepened the pockets of national oil companies that are not subject to the taxes or capital expenditure requirements of the many international companies they deal with. “There is an enormous tectonic shift going on,” says Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. “There is a difference between oil business and oil wealth and the initiative is shifting away from the international oil companies.”Recently, there have been a number of high-profile expropriations that illustrate just how that balance is shifting, most notably Gazprom’s acquisition of a majority stake in Shell’s Sakhalin-2 project in Russia late last year. Since then other countries have flexed their muscles. Venezuela’s PdVSA in June took over ExxonMobil’s and ConocoPhillips’ assets in the country after the companies chose to walk away and seek compensation rather than hand over greater control.Kazakhstan has also stepped up pressure on a consortium led by Eni to hand over a greater share of its stake in the Kashagan field, one of the world’s biggest, to the state owned company KazMunaiGaz.Even a country such as Nigeria, long considered by industry executives as having relatively easy commercial terms, is looking to review contracts on offshore developments as part of a strategy of revamping its national oil company, NNPC.While national oil companies everywhere try to redefine themselves, many are far more advanced than others when it comes to their scale, scope and competence. “Some are clearly determined to be significant international players,” says Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. “But others do not have the global perspective.”Saudi Aramco is regarded as the best upstream operator among the state companies, having retained personnel from its original partners, but it is only a significant operator on the world stage in the downstream sector, where it is set to spend $7bn on expanding a US refinery with Shell. PetroChina, the state-controlled Chinese oil and gas group, this month overtook ExxonMobil to become the world’s biggest company by market capitalisation, but more than 90 per cent of its production is domestic.By contrast, Brazil’s Petrobras and Malaysia’s Petronas are both examples of national groups to have picked up the know-how and become competitors to international companies. Petrobras is a recognised leader in deepwater technology and derives 30 per cent of corporate revenues from abroad.But not all national oil companies are success stories. Iran’s Nioc and Venezuela’s PdVSA are examples of groups that operate as little more than bureaucracies struggling to maintain production targets amid their countries’ difficult investment climate, wasteful fuel price subsidies, and in PdVSA’s case, huge social spending bills to foot.Both Nioc and PdVSA, nevertheless have plans to form the Venezuelan-Iranian Oil and Gas Company, which they envisage becoming an important operator on the global exploration and production scene. Some analysts are sceptical over just how far the joint venture will go, but it is undeniably part of a wider trend of increasing technical co-operation or supply agreements among state entities.Over the past three years, such deals have increased markedly, with Chinese state-owned companies Sinopec, CNPC and CNOOC and India’s ONGC partnering with the likes of Gazprom, Algeria’s Sonatrach or Mexico’s Pemex to name a few.In such a context, international oil companies could become more marginalised, squeezed by escalating costs and emerging operators capable of dealing directly with the oil service companies that are essential contractors for the major multinationals.
568;COP;Conocophillips;2007-10-26T05:45:14Z;Shell and BP struggle to dig up returns;;"Shell’s drop in third-quarter profits follows a trend seen elsewhere in the global oil and gas industry.In spite of record oil prices, the major multinationals are struggling to book growth in profits, taking hits in their refining divisions or facing industry-wide cost pressures and delays to important new oil and gas projects.John S Herold, an oil and gas research firm, and industry advisory group Harrison Lovegrove recently estimated that spending by the 228 global oil and gas companies increased 45 per cent to $401bn in 2006 but they generated only a 2 per cent increase in reserve volumes to 263bn barrels of oil equivalent.The majors are still recording multibillion-dollar profits, but not at the levels they enjoyed before cost inflation took off.BP’s announcement this week of a 45 per cent reduction in third-quarter replacement cost profits was followed by drops in earnings at ConocoPhillips. And analysts predict similar gloomy news for Exxon’s results next week.At both Shell and BP, Europe’s two biggest oil companies, upstream production has fallen since 2005. This week Shell reported third-quarter production of 3.14m barrels of oil equivalent per day from 3.25m boe/d a year ago. BP reported a 4 per cent drop to 3.65m boe/d.Shell’s refinery processing intake was down 1 per cent while BP’s refining throughput was also slightly down.Yet companies such as Shell and BP seem to have beaten market expectations on profits, prompting some in the industry to question whether their prognosis has been too severe.Others say Shell’s $413m earnings – which reflect higher insurance underwriting income, improved interest income and favourable foreign exchange movements – mask weaker performance in its operating divisions.“Do not be fooled,” says Jason Kenney, senior oil and gas equity analyst at ING. “The potential for deals, reserves replacement [and] exploration upside all look cautious.”Other analysts disagree, saying Shell is in a strong cash position to keep pushing on with new projects. It had $14bn in hand at the end of September.With Shell and BP both expected to spend more than $20bn on capital projects next year, the question is where and what kind of return they will generate.Peter Voser, finance director of Shell, says that in the long term 60 to 70 per cent of cash flow is expected to be generated from projects with low or very low risk.But in this category he includes projects that have already been affected by government intervention, such as: Canadian oilsands refining; a multibillion-dollar, technologically complex gas-to-liquids project in Qatar; the Sakhalin-2 project in Russia; and Kashagan in Kazakhstan.Shell’s framework for production growth in the near term is 1 to 2 per cent a year, and longer-term 2 to 3 per cent a year. Its 2006 reserve figure of 12.9bn barrels of oil equivalent was buoyed by Canadian and Qatari reserves.The company says it is not in the business of chasing reserve volumes at the expense of profitability, but is focusing on the highest long-term value possible in a context where oil companies everywhere are having to look to new frontiers.BP is similarly bullish about production plans. It told investors this week that revenue streams and production figures were expected to increase now projects that had long been delayed were due on stream.But it, too, has had to look away from its traditional assets, and this week announced job cuts in the North Sea.“Both companies are in a mode where they have to go to parts of the world to get new growth, moving on from old assets. The challenge is looking at delivering very complicated projects in the non-OECD world,” says James Neale, an analyst at Citigroup.Both companies can also expect to take hits in the years to come when production-sharing contracts hit maturity and they have to begin to split profits with the host countries that the projects are in.But in the meantime, Shell may be facing more immediate problems.The provincial government in Alberta is considering raising taxes on Canadian oilsands projects. In Nigeria, where Shell holds a significant portion of its reserves, the government is also looking at altering contracts."
569;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Backlash against carbon capture plan;;Several energy groups led by Centrica are preparing to challenge a government plan for subsidising low-emission power generation, accusing ministers of poor consultation and potentially wasting taxpayers’ money.John Hutton, the business and enterprise secretary, announced on Tuesday that the government would subsidise only one “carbon capture and storage” power plant, to be chosen through a competition among energy suppliers.However, he drew fierce criticism from sections of the industry and the carbon markets by stipulating that the support would be awarded only to companies using “post-combustion” carbon capture techniques at a coal-fired plant. The result is that many companies’ plans have been suddenly made ineligible.The method requires carbon dioxide to be separated from the flue gas produced when fossil fuels are burnt to generate electricity. A chemical solvent is used to take out the carbon dioxide, by a well-established industrial process.An alternative method, rejected by the government, is to capture carbon dioxide pre-combustion, using technology called integrated gasification combined cycle.This requires the fuel to be combined with oxygen, air or steam, to produce a gas consisting mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.A reaction between carbon monoxide and steam then produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which is separated off.Mr Hutton said coal had been chosen as the fuel with which to demonstrate the project because it was abundant but dirty.A spokesman said the technology was the most easily retrofitted to existing power stations, particularly in developing countries such as China.He added that the US and Norway were working on different technologies, so it made sense for the UK to choose its own route.But Ian Temperton, managing directory of the advisory unit at Climate Change Capital, an independent investment bank specialising in climate issues, said the government had made a mistake in picking a technology winner.“We think that the government’s decision to back only a post-combustion carbon and capture power plant is wrong. The government is basically telling power companies that they can keep building conventional high- emitting coal plant and that the taxpayer will bail them out.”Energy companies whose carbon capture projects are now not eligible for subsidies were on Thursday preparing to mount a challenge to the government’s decision.Centrica, owner of British Gas, is leading the formation of an industry group to oppose the policy, which is expected to include Shell, Marathon Oil, ConocoPhilips, BP, Scottish and Southern Energy, and Richard Budge’s Powerfuel group, as well as Climate Change Capital and Greenpeace.Nick Luff, Centrica finance director, was last night due to raise the issue with Mr Hutton at a dinner, and top executives of the energy companies are planning to meet over the weekend to discuss what form the challenge will take.Centrica accuses the government of not consulting energy companies properly before making its decision and says that funding post-combustion projects is not the best use of taxpayers’ money.“Excluding pre-combustion capture technology in favour of post-combustion capture technology means bypassing a cheaper method for capturing carbon that will have more international application in favour of a technology largely used to retrofit existing coal plant,” said Jake Ulrich, managing director of Centrica Energy.Centrica was planning to put forward its £1bn pre-combustion capture project on Teesside, but said that without government funding there was “a question mark over the economics of this project”.Scottish and Southern Energy, Powerfuel and Eon have all been working on pre-combustion carbon capture projects that now look in doubt. Scottish and Southern said it would encourage the government to review its decision “to ensure that the scope of the competition allows the maximum possible participation”.
570;COP;Conocophillips;2007-10-09T02:09:06Z;Nazarbayev says no revision of Kashagan;;Kazakhstan’s dispute with an Italian-led consortium over delays and cost overruns in developing the Kashagan oilfield can be resolved without rewriting the contract, President Nursultan Nazarbayev told Italy’s visiting prime minister on Monday.Romano Prodi and Paolo Scaroni, the head of Eni which is 30 per cent owned by the Italian government and is the project operator, both pronounced themselves pleased with the outcome of discussions over the world’s most expensive oil project.Analysts noted, however, that negotiations still lay ahead and that the consortium could face a large bill from Kazakhstan, possibly in the form of a penalty.“The attitude of the president is extremely positive and can be instrumental in reaching an accord in the future,” said Mr Prodi at a joint press conference in the capital Astana with Mr Nazarbayev.Mr Prodi’s visit, together with more than 150 Italian business representatives, had been planned before the dispute blew up in August when Kazakhstan threatened to suspend work at the oilfield for environmental reasons. The Kazakh government also suggested that, KazMunaiGas (KMG), the state oil company with an 8.3 per cent stake in the consortium, become co-operator.Mr Scaroni told the Financial Times from Astana: “As a result of the Prodi visit, everyone is more optimistic about the Kashagan project and about the direction in which Kazakhstan is moving with foreign oil investors.”He told reporters that the consortium would respond to KMG’s desire to have a “bigger involvement” in the project. Partners include Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp, Total, ConocoPhillips and Japan’s Inpex.In his first public intervention over the dispute, Mr Nazarbayev appeared to want to reassure the Italian side, following tough comments from his ministers.”We are not talking about revising the contract signed 10 years ago,” he said. But he also noted that delays had cost Kazakhstan a lot of money and that the Kazakh side had the right to act according to the law if contracts were violated. “And I think Eni understands that,” he added.The president was referring to amendments recently passed by parliament that would allow the state to rewrite or annul contracts concerning natural resources under special circumstances. Mr Prodi’s delegation raised its concerns over the law.Eni faces an October 22 deadline to settle the dispute amicably. Analysts questioned how the issue would be resolved without a renegotiation of the contract.“It would be possible for Kazakhstan to solve the dispute without changing the contract if it were to levy a penalty for delayed production,” commented Julia Nanay, senior director of PFC Energy consultancy.Mr Prodi is to visit the Caspian sea oil field, which is projected to pump 1.5m barrels a day, on Tuesday.Kiev agrees debt repayment terms with GazpromGazprom and Ukraine are to sign a deal on Tuesday spelling out exact terms for repaying $1.3bn (€910m, £640m) in natural gas arrears owed by Kiev, the Russian state-run gas group said, potentially resolving a standoff that has raised fears of shortfalls in gas supplies to Europe.Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said the latest round of talks between the gas group and Ukraine’s fuel and energy minister Yuriy Boiko on Monday had resulted in “agreement on a scheme to repay the debt”.Mr Kupriyanov, however, declined to disclose the terms, saying only that the repayment deal would be formally signed on Tuesday when Ukrainian prime minister Viktor Yanukovich is due to arrive in Moscow.But a spokesman for Ukraine’s energy ministry disclosed that payment would be partly made via transfers of gas kept in underground storage facilities by the gas group’s partner in Ukraine. “Some gas will be returned on the balance of Gazprom, namely the gas in underground storage. And some debt will be paid with money,” he said.Gazprom last week threatened to cut supplies to Ukraine if the country failed to settle the $1.3bn debt by November 1. The warning sparked fears of a re-run of a 2006 price dispute which resulted in shortfalls in gas supplies to Europe after Moscow turned off deliveries to Ukraine for three days. About 80 per cent of Europe’s gas supplies from Russia transits through Ukraine’s pipeline network.Gazprom’s latest threat had also sparked accusations it was politically motivated, coming just two days after parliamentary elections in Kiev in which a pro-western coalition headed by President Viktor Yushechenko and former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko looked set to return to power.Officials in Kiev have said the debt is not owed by the Ukrainian state, as Gazprom initially charged, but by Gazprom’s partners: namely the two companies in charge of selling the gas to Ukraine, Rosukrenergo and Ukrgazenergo. Gazprom owns 50 per cent of Rosukrenergo, which in turn owns 50 per cent of Ukrgazenergo, where most of the debts to Russia lie.Mr Boiko told Ukrainian television over the weekend that about $600m worth of the debt could be paid off by transferring gas kept in storage facilities in Ukraine.But Oleksiy Ivchenkohas, the former head of Ukrainian gas monopoly Naftogaz Ukrainy, cautioned payment in such a way could weaken Kiev’s future position in price talks with Russia.
571;COP;Conocophillips;2007-10-05T03:00:13Z;Prodi juggles twin roles in Kazakhstan;;"Romano Prodi, Italy’s prime minister, takes a 200-strong business delegation to Kazakhstan this weekend while facing the tricky task of lobbying for foreign investors without politicising the dispute over the development of the giant Kashagan oilfield by an Italian-led ­consortium.Italian officials said on Thursday that Mr Prodi, joined by Emma Bonino, the international trade minister, would put a “strong focus” in their talks with President Nursultan Nazarbayev on Monday on new amendments to the natural resource law.The amendments, which empower the government to annul or revise contracts damaging Kazakhstan’s economic security, were passed by the Kazakh parliament last week. But they still require the president’s signature to come into force.The timing of parliament’s move raised suspicions it was intended to put pressure on Italy’s Eni and its consortium partners while talks continue over renegotiating the terms of the Kashagan contract.That follows long delays and soaring costs in developing the world’s most expensive energy project.The new law “could have a wider fall-out in terms of giving cause for concern to foreign investors at large”, even though it was restric­ted to natural resources, Ms Bonino told the Financial Times. Italy is still evaluating its legal implications.Ms Bonino said Italy strongly supported Kazakhstan’s early accession to the World Trade Organisation and continuing European Union/Kazakh negotiations.But she reminded Kazakhstan that the WTO membership implied “a more instinctively multilateral approach when considering legislation of this kind”.Eni, which is 30 per cent state-owned, is in the difficult position of wanting political support over the Caspian project while keeping negotiations limited to financing and management.Italian officials said Eni had not requested that Mr Prodi intervene in the negotiations, although he will visit the Kashagan field on Tuesday.Talks are to resume on Friday in the capital Astana with Eni and its consortium partners, including Shell, ExxonMobil, Conoco­Phillips, Total and Inpex of Japan.Kazakhstan is confident that investors will continue to beat a trail to its door.Askar Balzhanov, the president of KazMunaigas Exploration and Production, a division of Kazakhstan’s state oil company, said the law would not diminish investor interest.“When Hugo Chávez forcibly buys up foreign oil company interests in Latin America it is all right; so why, when Kazakhstan introduces a civilised legal amendment, does everyone suddenly get worried?“I don’t think the investment climate in Kazakhstan will become less attractive,” he told the Financial Times.Kazakhstan said this week that most of its complaints about environmental abuse at Kashagan had been settled.That removed an earlier threat by the ministry of ecology to halt work at the oilfield.Sauat Mynbayev, the oil and gas minister, told a conference in Almaty this week he hoped the dispute would be resolved without resort to legal action."
572;COP;Conocophillips;2007-09-26T19:01:22Z;Kazakh law allows breaking of contracts;;Lawmakers in Kazakhstan have approved a bill empowering the state to annul natural resource contracts, strengthening the oil-rich Central Asian republic’s hand in its dispute with foreign oil groups led by Eni of Italy at the giant Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea.The Majilis, Kazakhstan’s parliament, voted unanimously in favour of an amendment to the natural resource law on Wednesday allowing the government to cancel or introduce retrospective changes to contracts perceived to harm the national economic interest.Yerlan Nigmatulin, a Kazakh MP who proposed the bill, said: “The draft law aims to enhance our country’s national interest over natural resources.”The new bill requires approval from parliament’s upper chamber and from Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s president, before becoming law. Approvals are likely to be forthcoming as all parliamentarians belong to Mr Nazarbayev’s party.Kazakhstan has set an October 22 deadline for settlement of the row over Kashagan. The government has demanded compensation for delays to production and cost overruns at the field, the core development in the republic’s plan to triple oil output within a decade.Eni maintains that the dispute over Kashagan is commercial in nature and that the contract can be renegotiated by all consortium members together with KMG.The western partners do not see the government wanting to put the whole future of Kashagan in danger at the risk of damaging investor confidence.Other members of the Kashagan consortium include ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Inpex.Eni and its partners submitted a revised development plan this summer, postponing by two years until late 2009 a start to production at Kashagan and admitting that the cost of the first phase of the project had almost doubled to $19bn (€13bn, £9.4bn).The cost overrun will cause Kazakhstan substantial financial losses because the contract allows Eni and partners to delay payment of royalties to the government until after cost recovery.Kazakhstan has interpreted the delay and cost inflation as a change to the Kashagan contract, entitling it to revise terms itself. Kazakhstan’s ecology ministry has also accused the Eni group of breaking environmental rules, while tax authorities complain that investors have evaded customs duties on equipment.Some analysts see parallels between the Kashagan dispute and last year’s dispute over cost inflation and alleged environmental damage at the Sakhalin-2 gas and oil project in Russia, which ended after a Shell-led group allowed Gazprom to muscle into the project.Kazakhstan has demanded that KazMunaiGas, the state oil company, be appointed co-operator at Kashagan.Additional reporting by Guy Dinmore in Rome
573;COP;Conocophillips;2007-09-13T21:53:20Z;Exxon to seek ruling on oil asset handover;;ExxonMobil’s decision to seek compensation from Venezuela via international arbitration after Caracas increased state control of oil projects in the Orinoco Belt has increased the likelihood that rival ConocoPhillips will follow suit.Both US oil companies refused to sign an agreement on the handover of their operations to PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, in June, choosing instead to walk away from their multi-billion dollar investments and seek compensation.Exxon opted for arbitration after failing to reach a settlement directly with Hugo Chávez’s government.“Arbitration always looked to be the most likely route for both companies. Conoco will have no option but to follow suit and file for arbitration, especially given PDVSA’s reluctance to pay at market value and in cash,” said Patrick Esteruelas, analyst at Eurasia Group in New York.He said that since Conoco is owed far more than Exxon, its chances of receiving what it wants were “even slimmer”.Exxon’s stake in the Orinoco had a book value of $750m and a market value in excess of $2bn. Conoco’s assets had a combined net book value of $4.5bn and a market value of about $7bn.Analysts say that if Exxon’s case is successful, and Venezuela refuses to comply, the government may have to speed up plans to sell its Citgo refining assets in the US, worth around $20bn, to avoid the possibility of any action being taken against themMr Esteruelas points out that the key problem is not how much the companies are paid, but the form of compensation. “Here the distance separating PDVSA and the companies has been too big to bridge,” he says, explaining that PDVSA has insisted on paying in crude or reserves.ExxonMobil said it was “disappointed” it had had to resort to international arbitration.ConocoPhilips said it was continuing its talks with the government. “We are hopeful that we can resolve matters amicably,’’ said spokesman Bill Tanner. This month, however, John Lowe, head of exploration and production conceded that international arbitration was a possibility.Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty in Houston
574;COP;Conocophillips;2007-09-12T18:45:32Z;Lukoil seeks bigger presence in EU;;Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil company, is planning more acquisitions in the European Union, believing that the market has become more favourable for deals, a senior executive has told the Financial Times.Lukoil, which is 20 per cent owned by ConocoPhillips of the US, has earmarked $9bn for buying downstream businesses in Europe, including refining, distribution and retailing.Leonid Fedun, Lukoil’s vice-president for strategy, said: “Until recently, it was not a good situation for acquisitions, be-cause stock markets were going up and the oil price was high, so sellers had very high expectations as to prices. Now the stock markets are much healthier.”Lukoil’s ambitions reflect its strategy of using its upstream strength in oil production in Russia to build its position in EU markets. It operates about 2,000 petrol stations in Europe.Lukoil showed its increased market power in July, when it slowed deliveries of oil through the Druzhba pipeline as part of negotiations to win a better price from refineries in Germany.Mr Fedun said if Lukoil could refine the oil it sold in Europe, it would make “at least $1bn more [a year]”. He was speaking as Lukoil reported a 4.8 per cent decline in net income for the first half of the year, to $3.82bn. He added that Russia now had more export options for its oil, so could negotiate better terms with European customers.“These refineries are not going to get windfall profits any more, meaning that they will be more willing to talk,” said Mr Fedun. “It is no longer a buyer’s market [for crude oil], it is a seller’s market.” Mol of Hungary and PKN Orlen of Poland were among the companies whose refining margins had been squeezed, he said.Lukoil has been rumoured as a potential partner for Mol, which is resisting overtures from OMV, the Austrian oil company that has taken an 18.9 per cent stake.However, Mr Fedun said: “Of course we are interested in Mol, but . . . what we are seeing in central and eastern Europe is nationalism, and this nationalism is getting stronger in other European countries as well.”Lukoil may be more able to pick up assets such as refineries. The European refining market is changing because of the decline in production from the North Sea, and companies such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil have been selling refineries in EU countries.
575;COP;Conocophillips;2007-09-11T16:36:52Z;Kashagan delays to hit Kazakh growth;;Kazakhstan on Tuesday told Italy’s Eni that delays and cost inflation at the huge Kashagan oil development would stymie the Central Asian republic’s econ­omic growth.Paolo Scaroni, chief executive of Eni, the operator of the consortium developing Kashagan, met Karim Massimov, the Kazakh prime minister, and Sauat Mynbaev, the energy minister, in Astana to discuss the ­government’s demand for improved contract terms. The Kazakh government is seeking compensation for a two-year delay to production and a doubling of costs of the first phase of the Kashagan project.Kazakhstan is dissatisfied with Eni’s management of Kashagan, which lies at the heart of the republic’s plans to triple oil production within the decade.Mr Mynbaev issued a statement saying problems at the field would “substantially reduce the planned rate of economic growth in the coming decade, threatening fulfilment of the long-term programme for the econ­omic development of the country”.Eni said the talks were held in a “climate of co-operation”. Mr Scaroni also met officials from KazMunaigas, the Kazakh state oil company, which the government said last week should co-operate on Kashagan.Eni’s partners at Kashagan include ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, ConocoPhillips and Inpex of Japan.Mr Mynbaev said Kazakh­stan was “ready for open dialogue” with the Eni group, adding: “I ask you not to politicise our basic demand that resource users fulfil their obligations.”
576;COP;Conocophillips;2007-09-09T17:39:50Z;Early resolution unlikely in Eni’s Kashagan standoff;;Over a month has elapsed since Kazakhstan gave a foreign oil group led by Italy’s Eni 60 days to agree how to compensate the government for damage caused by delays and cost overruns at the giant Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea, one of the biggest and most complex oil developments in the world.So far there appears to be no agreement about anything – except that the Kashagan dispute is a mess for all involved.It is also unclear how far Kazakhstan, which is understood to have consulted with US lawyers, is prepared to go to force the Eni group to concede more favourable terms at Kashagan.Karim Massimov, prime minister of Kazakhstan, told reporters last week that the government had a “Plan B” up its sleeve if the dispute was not soon resolved. “I’ll tell you about it later,” he said.Kashagan is crucial to Kazakhstan’s ambition to triple oil production and emerge as an important force on world energy markets in the coming decade.Anvar Saidenov, governor of the national bank of Kazakhstan, said: “Kashagan will determine the macroeconomic landscape and the shape of the economy in the future.”The project will impact “foreign investment flows, export revenues, the national oil fund, the budget – everything,” he told the Financial Times.Mr Saidenov did not rule out the possibility of an early resolution of the dispute but added: “We are probably just at the beginning, not even the middle of negotiations.”Eni and its partners – ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, ConocoPhillips and Inpex of Japan – also face losses from the late start of the project where much of the $19bn of investment required for the first phase has already been sunk.The central struggle in talks will be over the division of cash flows from the field where, with the full development now expected to absorb $137bn, returns will be less attractive than oil majors usually expect.There is concern that Kazakhstan might demand a larger share in Kashagan, one of the only fields in the north Caspian where Kaz-MunaiGas (KMG), the state oil company, does not have a majority interest.Mr Massimov called last week for the appointment of KMG as a co-operator with the project but said that Kazakhstan was “immune” to resource nationalism.However, government officials admitted that KMG is being groomed as a “national champion”.There are also fears that Kazakhstan might offer Kashagan to rival investors. An announcement that President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan would visit Brazil this month aroused speculation that Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company, might be invited into the project.Analysts said few international oil companies had the financial and technical might, or even the desire, to take on a field as complex as Kashagan.Eni last week thanked Kazakhstan for its “constructive” approach to the dispute.The government alleges that the Eni group has infringed environmental laws, evaded tax and breached fire regulations.In response, the Eni group appears to have closed ranks, refusing to reveal details about the talks.Kazakhstan’s open criticism of Eni’s management of the project may trigger a potentially divisive struggle within the group for the operational control of Kashagan.ExxonMobil, already embroiled in a dispute with Gazprom over its contractual right to export natural gas from the Sakhalin-1 project in Russia, is expected to adopt a less flexible approach to the government’s demand for a contract revision than some European companies.The group’s immediate task is to convince the government not to stop the project altogether.
577;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
578;COP;Conocophillips;2007-09-06T21:17:19Z;Oil services;;Oil services is an unfailingly cyclical industry. The OSX index of leading operators is yoked to Brent crude prices: when big oil companies are flush with cash, they spend it. But there are cycles within the cycle.The next subsector primed for an upswing could be the refinery refurbishment specialists. Recent gains in the OSX – up about 45 per cent so far this year – have been driven mostly by big investments in upstream areas such as drilling and oilfield services, where US specialists such as National Oilwell Varco (up 114 per cent), Global Industries (up 86 per cent) and Smith International (up 65 per cent) have benefited. While upstream spending should stay strong, there are signs that the focus for capital expenditure is moving down the production stream to refineries. BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, among others, have indicated that they will be looking to squeeze more capacity out of existing facilities.Refinery upgrades in the US, in particular, are long overdue. Many of the country’s 149 refineries have not had heavy investment since the mid-1970s, when the oil majors upped capacity to take advantage of cheap Mexican and Venezuelan crude. Improvements since then have been largely ad hoc, replacing the odd component, or as a response to regulatory pressure to cut emissions. And as for building all-new refineries, forget it: nimbyism makes that next to impossible in Western markets.It’s a tough field, dominated by integrated engineering, procurement and construction outfits such as Bechtel, Jacobs, Foster Wheeler and Holland’s CB&I. But for the medium term, there is enough slack in the system to suggest oil services specialists with above-average exposure to refinery upgrades – among them Technip of France, the UK’s Petrofac and Wood Group, and Matrix of the US – are in a sweet spot all of their own.
579;COP;Conocophillips;2007-09-04T18:12:30Z;Kazakhstan seeks $10bn Eni damages;;Kazakhstan said on Tuesday it would seek $10bn of compensation for econ­omic damage from escalating cost and late development of the Kashag­an oilfield, led by Italy’s Eni.Eni opened talks last week with Kazakhstan about the dispute, which erupted after Eni presented the government with a revised development plan for Kashagan delaying first production until 2010 and doubling the cost of the first, 300,000 barrels a day, phase to $19bn.Kashagan, one of the biggest untapped oilfields in the world, is crucial to Kazakh­stan’s plan to triple oil production and emerge as a big presence on world energy markets within the decade.Daulet Yergozhin, Kazakh­stan’s deputy finance minister, said, “Certainly it will be more than $10bn”, Reuters reported. Kazakhstan had unanswered questions about tax payments by the Eni group, he said.Eni declined to comment on Kazakhstan’s request.Mr Yergozhin was speaking on the eve of a deadline set by the government for Eni to come up with detailed proposals on how to resolve the Kashagan problem.But Eni’s head of exploration and production division, Stefano Cao, told Dow Jones that talks under way be­tween the consortium and the Kazakh authorities were “open and constructive” and all efforts were being made to resolve the dispute. Mr Cao is leading Eni’s Kashagan talks delegation.“We are confident all matters will be addressed in accordance with existing PSA terms,” Mr Cao added, referring to the consortium’s current production-sharing agreement with the Kazakh government.Kazakhstan has demanded more favourable terms at Kashagan, where under the production-sharing contract, investors can delay payment of royalties until development costs are recovered.Oil officials are concerned Kazakhstan may attempt to wrest shares in Kashagan from the group as part of a strategy to bolster state control over the industry.Richard Gordon, president of Gordon Energy Solutions, said Kazakhstan’s demand for improved terms at Kashagan were understandable because production sharing contracts were unfavourable to host governments in times of cost inflation.The Kashagan contract was negotiated when oil prices were moderate and costs stable, the opposite of conditions today, he said.Eni and its partners Shell, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Total and Inpex of Japan could not expect “stellar returns” from the Kashagan project, he said.
580;COP;Conocophillips;2007-09-03T18:21:20Z;Caspian lessons for oil giants;;When a delegation of executives from five of the world’s biggest oil companies led by Italy’s Eni went to Kazakhstan last week to seek to resolve a dispute at the giant Kashagan oilfield, they were met with news that the government had halted work on the development on environmental grounds and had launched a criminal inquiry into alleged tax evasion on equipment imports.It was an inauspicious start to what Paolo Scaroni, Eni’s chief executive, had said would be “friendly talks” about the future of Kashagan. Irked by surging costs and sliding production deadlines, Kazakhstan is demanding improved terms.The dispute erupted after Eni presented the central Asian country with a revised development plan for the Caspian Sea field – delaying the start of production by two years until late 2010 and doubling to $19bn (£9.4bn, €14bn) the cost of the first, 300,000-barrel-a-day stage of the project. Separately, Kazakhstan revealed that estimates for the full cost of the 40-year project had climbed from an earlier $57bn to reach $136bn – which could make Kashagan the most expensive industrial endeavour undertaken anywhere.The revised plan will deprive Kazakhstan of substantial revenues and hold back its aim to treble oil production and enter the ranks of the world’s top 10 oil exporters. The dispute, coming at a time of growing resource nationalism worldwide, may provide Kazakhstan with a pretext to exert greater control over Kashagan, one of the few untapped fields in the world capable of producing 1.5m b/d.Kashagan is crucial as a future source of non-Opec supplies to western governments, which have urged Kazakhstan to join projects to transport Caspian oil to the west rather than through Russia or Iran or direct to China.For western oil majors, increasingly at risk of being marginalised by assertive state oil companies, Kashagan is an important foothold in the promising north Caspian, where Kazakh and Russian companies dominate.The European Union warned last week that it would intervene if investors’ rights were violated at Kashagan. Andris Piebalgs, energy commissioner, said the EU would “take adequate measures if the legal rights of European companies were put at risk”. Romano Prodi, prime minister of Italy, may bring forward a visit to Kazakhstan planned for early October.Analysts say Eni, which has staked its future growth on Kashagan, carries the blame for promising more than it could deliver when it won the coveted operatorship of the field in 2001. Richard Gordon, president of Gordon Energy Solutions, an oil extraction consultancy, says: “Eni was excessively exuberant about costs and production schedules early on and created expectations that are coming back to bite it very hard.”Other consortium members including ExxonMobil, Conoco-Phillips, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Japan’s Inpex will also suffer as what Mr Gordon calls the “rolling thunder of cost inflation echoing high oil prices” forces up the cost of Kashagan, as at mega-oil projects elsewhere. “Kashagan is not going to yield the kind of stellar returns that that oil majors usually require,” he says. But the size of Kashagan’s reserves would ensure the companies “stay with the programme” despite the difficulties.Kashagan, described by one geologist as “mad, bad and dangerous to know”, is one of the most difficult oil projects ever tackled. Its oil, laced with poisonous hydrogen sulphide, lies deep beneath the seabed under huge pressure, presenting the risk of explosion. The waters are shallow and difficult to navigate, particularly during winter ice.The complications do not end there. Even the environmentally lax Soviets banned drilling in the north Caspian, a natural habitat for numerous rare birds and fish, including the Beluga sturgeon. Kazakhstan’s ecology ministry, which has withdrawn environmental permits at Kashagan for three months, says the project may have caused the death of seals on the coast last winter.There are parallels between the Kashagan dispute and Russia’s row last year with a Shell-led group at Sakhalin-2 off Siberia – which ended when foreign investors caved in to Gazprom’s demand for a majority stake after objections about cost overruns and environmental abuse at the liquefied natural gas project.Kazakhstan’s policy is to bolster the state’s role in the oil industry. Recent legislation entitles KazMunaigas, the state oil company, to a majority interest in all future Caspian Sea developments. But even if the ultimate goal is to take over Kashagan, KazMunaigas has neither the technical nor financial muscle to do so now. “Why would they take it away from us now, when we are spending so much money?” asks one top oilman.Terms at the field will almost certainly change. Kazakhstan, like Russia, is disenchanted with production-sharing contracts that allow investors to defer royalty payments until after the groups involved recover their costs – a model that is fiscally unattractive for host governments at a time when cost inflation is high.Kazakhstan’s dissatisfaction with Eni could make room for KazMunaigas, currently a minority stakeholder in the group, to step in as leader. There is speculation that ExxonMobil, which recently relocated its Kazakh headquarters to Atyrau, a town on the Caspian, might bid to be operator. But people close to the US group say the job would be a poison chalice until Kashagan was clear of the quagmire.Karim Massimov, prime minister, who earlier pledged that Kazakhstan would respect all existing oil deals, interpreted the delay at Kashagan as a change to the contract itself, entitling Kazakhstan to renegotiate terms.The perception that western groups squeezed the government too hard during negotiations in the 1990s, when the former Soviet republic was desperate for investment, underlies the dispute and may threaten other projects. Oraz Jandosov, co-leader of the opposition All National Social Democratic party, says contracts at the huge Tengiz and Karachaganak fields are more biased in favour of foreign investors than Kashagan, which “should not be the first to be singled out for contract change”.Kazakhstan is being courted by others keen on Caspian acreage, particularly foreign state oil companies, driven by political as well as commercial concerns. China, having last month agreed to help Kazakh­stan build an oil export pipeline linking the Caspian with China, is expected to step up its search for opportunities.
581;COP;Conocophillips;2007-08-27T10:55:37Z;Kazakhs halt work at Kashagan field;;Kazakhstan on Monday called a three-month halt to work at the giant Kashagan oilfield, claiming that a consortium led by Italy’s Eni had broken environmental rules at the project and evaded customs duties on imported equipment.The move will intensify pressure on Eni, which opens talks Monday with Kazakhstan about possible changes to the contract terms at Kashagan, where repeated delays and soaring costs have angered authorities.Nurlan Iskakov, Kazakhstan’s minister of ecology, said, ”We have stopped work [at Kashagan] for three months…We have taken this unprecedented step because our environmental demands have not yet been fully met”.Separately, Kazakhstan’s finance ministry said it would launch a criminal investigation into alleged customs tax evasion by subcontractors working for Eni.”Preliminary losses to the Kazakh budget resulting from the unlawful actions by affiliates of the consortium amount to over $2.5m,” the ministry said.Eni spokesperson: ”In the past few days we have received a letter asking for a friendly re-discussion of the contract. Today in Astana [the Kazakh capital] representatives of the consortium will meet local authorities to analyse the situation.”Last week, the ecology ministry threatened to revoke the Eni-led group’s Kashagan licence, saying that pollution related to the oilfield development, one of the world’s biggest and most challenging, may have caused the death of large numbers of rare seals early this year in the north Caspian Sea.Eni informed the Kazakh government on June 29 that Kashagan would not begin producing oil until late 2010, two years behind schedule. The Italian company also said the cost of the first phase of the project had risen to $19bn, almost double original estimates.Kazakhstan interpreted the delay as a change to the Kashagan contract of 1997, entitling it to demand more favourable terms including an increase in its share of oil profit to 40 per cent from an earlier contracted 10 per cent.Paolo Scaroni, Eni chief executive, last week said talks with the Kazakh government on the issue would begin today and last about 60 days.The escalating Kashagan dispute has been compared with Russia’s dispute with Shell, which resulted in the oil group losing control of the huge Sakhalin-2 LNG project to Gazprom last year after Moscow complained about rising costs and environmental problems.Ivan Mazalov, a portfolio manager at Prosperity Capital Markets, said Eni “had dropped the ball at Kashagan”.Repeated delays and soaring costs at Kashagan would cause Kazakhstan substantial financial losses, he said. The field, estimated to contain 30bn barrels of oil, is critical to Kazakhstan’s plan to triple production and become one of the world’s top oil exporters in the coming decade.Eni said safety precautions had necessitated the delay at Kashagan where oil, laden with poisonous sulfurous gas, lies in high-pressure reservoirs.The Italian group’s Kashagan consortium includes Shell, ExxonMobil, Total, ConocoPhillips and Inpex. KazMunaigas, Kazakhstan’s state oil company has a minority stake in the project.
582;COP;Conocophillips;2007-08-21T10:56:49Z;Hurricane Dean hits Mexican coast;;Hurricane Dean, a monster category 5 storm, made landfall on Mexico’s Caribbean coast on Tuesday, with roaring winds and heavy rain that battered beach resorts where thousands of tourists huddled in shelters.Seas churned as the eye of the storm, which has already killed 11 people on its rampage through the Caribbean, smashed into the shore near the cruise ship port of Costa Maya, not far from the border with Belize.The US National Hurricane Center said it was the first category 5 storm to make landfall in the Atlantic Basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992.Dean was still packing sustained winds of 165 miles per hour (268 kph), with gusts of up to 200 mph when it came ashore, but was expected to weaken as it passed over the Yucatan Peninsula. Many resorts were badly damaged in 2005 by hurricane Wilma. The region is important to the Mexican economy.Category 5 hurricanes – the strongest possible – are rare but there were four in 2005, including Katrina, which devastated New Orleans.Mexico’s state oil company on Monday closed about 2.65m barrels a day of crude oil production as the hurricane approached. Pemex said it was closing more than 400 oil wells on its Cantarell oilfield and the Ku Maloob Zaap complex and warned it might invoke the “force majeure” clause to delay its crude oil exports.“The declaration of ‘force majeure’ will depend on the potential damage that Dean might inflict,” Pemex said.Mexico is the world’s fifth largest oil producer and a US key supplier. However, oil prices declined as traders said Dean was likely to spare US oil and natural gas production areas and the Texas refineries. US oil prices fell 86 cents a barrel to $71.12.Oil companies operating in the US Gulf of Mexico, such as Shell, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhilips, on Monday said they were beginning to restart production shut down because of the hurricane. US natural gas production suffered a large fall, dropping more than 10 per cent to $6.304 per million British thermal units.Commodities traders were worried about any losses of the valuable Jamaican coffee crop, which was hit by Dean on Sunday, but prices in New York declined to $1.148 a pound on good supplies awaiting a better assessment of any damages. Jamaica’s Blue Mountain coffee is regarded as among the world’s best.Jamaican authorities said 300,000 people were displaced by the storm and police said two people were killed on Sunday. Mudslides were reported across the island and some main roads were blocked. Electricity remained off.According to Eqecat, a commercial modelling company, hurricane Dean could cost insurers as much as $3bn.The majority of insured losses have been incurred in Jamaica.Eqecat, which could revise its forecast, said the claims would include wind damage to commercial and residential property.Insured costs were also expected to include claims under policies that pay out if businesses are unable to trade, and the impact of so-called demand surge, the increased cost of goods and services in the wake of a disaster.
583;COP;Conocophillips;2007-08-20T18:52:17Z;Oil groups boost R&D as states lock up reserves;;"The world’s international oil companies are increasing investments in technology to ensure their survival in an industry now dominated by their state-owned rivals.While the big international oil companies have always invested in technology research and development, it is becoming increasingly important to them as they find themselves shut out of much of the world’s oil reserves.More than 80 per cent of those reserves are controlled by state-controlled entities. Technological advances are crucial for the international oil companies to optimise the extraction of oil from the reserves under their control while at the same time convincing the national oil companies to let them help exploit their resources.“Patents will be as valuable as reserves in the future, particularly for the international oil companies,” said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy. “Technology is critical to unlock the value of reserves.”A survey by the Financial Times of the larger oil companies shows that R&D spending by many has jumped sharply recently.Royal Dutch Shell has raised its technology R&D budget 50 per cent over the past three years to $1.2bn in 2006.Chevron’s R&D has more than doubled over the past five years from $221m in 2002 to $468m last year. ConocoPhillips has budgeted $400m for this year, which is up about 50 per cent from what it historically spends.The rise in R&D spending at ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest international oil company, is less dramatic, up from $631m in 2002 to $733m last year. Exxon said this reflected the “priority” it has always given R&D.“It is particularly through technology that the international oil companies can differentiate themselves,” said Jan van der Eijk, Shell’s chief technology officer.Yet analysts consider recent commitments small when compared with other industries.Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at Rice University, had problems when she tried to compile a graphic comparing R&D spending across sectors.“I couldn’t put Microsoft, GM or Merck on the same slide with ExxonMobil, or ExxonMobil would have been too small.” Last year, both Microsoft and General Motors spent some $6.6bn each on R&D.The companies insist they commit far more to R&D than the numbers reflect, as it is spread throughout the business. It can take a decade to test and implement new technology.“We had to ask ourselves what was the right level of sustained investment through the cycles,” said Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips’ senior vice-president for technology. “Seven years ago, the price of oil was $12 a barrel; you have to look at it in that context.”"
584;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Pressure builds on Kashagan oil investors;;Kazakhstan turned up the heat this week on a consortium developing the giant Kashagan oilfield in the Caspian Sea, as investors opened talks with the government about possible changes to contract terms because of technical challenges.The field, discovered in 2000, is the largest found in more than 30 years and could be critical for global supplies. Only three of the world’s 4,000 oilfields now exceed the 1.5m barrels-a-day production Kashagan is expected to achieve by 2019.But Kashagan is also one of the world’s most difficult oilfields to develop, according to industry executives. Problems faced during development have pushed the cost of the first phase of the project to about $19bn (€14bn, £9.5bn) from an initial $10bn and the date of first production to 2010 from 2008.Italy’s Eni leads a consortium that includes Total, Shell, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Inpex.“We are already in contact with the Kazakh authorities and we are confident that the issue will be resolved for all parties,” Eni said on Wednesday.Baktykozha Izmukhambetov, Kazakh energy minister, told a government meeting last week that Eni had lifted its estimate of the cost of developing Kashagan to $137bn from $57bn after encountering technical difficulties. Eni would not confirm those figures.Karim Massimov, Kazakhstan’s prime minister, said last week the country regarded the delay at Kashagan as “a change to the contract itself”, implying the government felt entitled to demand more favourable terms from investors.Kazakhstan proposes to raise its share of production from Kashagan to 40 per cent from an earlier contracted 10 per cent. Other concessions are also being demanded.Mr Massimov said this week that the government might consider asking Eni to step down as project operator. Kazakh officials refused to comment on the remark, which contradicted recent statements by energy officials that the company’s role was secure.Analysts said a change in operator at such an advanced stage would bring little benefit to Kashagan.Julia Nanay, a senior director at PFC Energy, a Washington-based consultancy, said: “Whoever became operator at Kashagan would face the same formidable technical challenges as Eni.”In the 1990s Kazakhstan handed out its biggest oilfields to western majors. But as oil prices rose the government moved to ensure a greater role for the state in exploiting the huge wealth.Kazakh legislation now guarantees KazMunaigas, the state oil company, which holds an 8.33 per cent stake in Kashagan, a majority interest in all future Caspian Sea projects.Analysts say that Kazakhstan’s strategy is to use foreign oil companies as scapegoats for social ills that the government has not addressed.
585;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-30T18:29:58Z;Oil group warned on Kazakh project delay;;Kazakhstan has warned a foreign consortium led by Eni, the Italian oil company, that it will demand better terms at the giant Kashagan oilfield in the Caspian Sea to compensate for soaring costs and the delayed launch of production at one of the world’s most challenging oilfield developments.Baktykozha Izmukhambetov, Kazakhstan’s energy minister, told a government meeting on Monday that Eni had lifted its estimate of the full cost of developing Kashagan from $57bn (€41.6bn, £28bn) to $137bn after encountering technical difficulties in the field. Eni had also postponed Kashagan’s start-up by two years to 2010, he said.Eni, which leads the consortium with an 18.52 per cent stake, declined to comment on Monday. Other foreign stakeholders include Total, Shell, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Inpec.“We plan to begin negotiations with the companies about this project on August 6. The parameters of the project will be clarified once a consensus is found,” said Mr Izmukhambetov.Kazakhstan proposes to raise its own share of the profits from Kashagan oil, which will eventually produce over 1.5m barrels a day, to 40 per cent from 10 per cent. Other unspecified changes to the contract are also being considered.Foreign oil companies are concerned that Kazakhstan might follow the example set by Russia, which last year forced a Shell-led group to surrender a majority share in the Sakhalin II liquefied natural gas project to Gazprom after development costs almost doubled.KazMunaigas, Kazakhstan’s state oil company, bought an 8.33 per cent stake in Kashagan in 2004. Laws passed since then, designed to bolster the state’s role in the oil industry, have entitled KMG to a majority interest in all Caspian Sea oil projects.Chingis Mukhanov, a spokesman for the energy minister, said Kazakhstan was not seeking to punish investors for the postponed development but needed to offset economic losses resulting from the delay, which could derail the republic’s plan to triple its total oil production to 3m barrels a day by 2015. Most of Kazakhstan’s oil is exported. The government would not ask Eni to surrender the running of Kashagan, he said.Mr Mukhanov said surging costs at Kashagan reflected the “unbelievable complexity” and environmental risks of tapping Kashagan, where oil, laden with poisonous sulphurous gas, lies under huge pressure.Analysts said that KazMunaigas, which has hired ABN Amro and Visor Capital, a Kazakh investment bank, as its financial advisers at Kashagan, might now face difficulties meeting cash calls for its share of the development.
586;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-27T20:36:15Z;Wall St falls amid credit concerns;;"Wall Street closed lower on Friday after a tumultuous week in which the S&P 500 index experienced its worst performance since September 2002 as heightened credit market concerns battered stocks .Bad earnings news from the housing sector continued as DR Horton, the homebuilder, reported its first ever quarterly loss.Its shares were down 11.7 per cent for the week at $16.92. Beazer Homes also posted a $123m quarterly loss, sending its shares down 20.2 per cent at $15.66.This followed second quarter losses reported late on Wednesday from Pulte Homes, whose shares sank 10 per cent to $19.84.Ryland Group shares fared better than the rest of the sector but still ended the week down 3.9 per cent at $33.94.Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, fell 12.2 per cent to $30.09 after
it posted a 33 per cent slide in second quarter profit.The weaker housing market prompted it to lower the 2007 outlook.“The credit story is still too opaque and evolving at too rapid a pace for anyone to seriously take a shot at counter-trading this into the weekend, and any big move is much more likely to come from a further slide in risky assets than a recovery today,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.“If there are a few ingredients worth remembering, it is that credit events are not one-day, one-week or even one-month wonders.”Shares in recently floated private equity and hedge fund group Fortress Investment Group suffered a bout of investor uncertainty last week.It was down 10.5per cent for the week at $19.95.Financials were once again hit by continuing subprime concerns. Bear Stearns shares were down 7.1 per cent at $125.10 while Citigroup lost 6.3 per cent to close at $47.53, JPMorgan fell 5.3 per cent to $45.02 and Goldman Sachs fell 4.5 per to $196.68.CME Group reported a 15 per cent rise in quarterly results as the merger between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings and the Chicago Board of Trade was completed. Its shares roe 1 per cent to $562.54.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 4.9 per cent for the week at 1,458.95 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.7 per cent lower at 2,562.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4.2 per cent lower at 13,265.47 for the week.In earnings news, Chevron reported a 24 per cent rise in second quarter profit, but its shares suffered from the prevailing bearish mood, ending the week down 5.7 per cent at $86.88.Investors received upbeat news on the economy on Friday, as the Commerce Department reported that the nation’s economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace during the second quarter.Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.4 per cent annual rate for the second quarter, while the first quarter was downwardly revised to 0.6 per cent from an original estimate of 0.7 per cent.But analysts said credit concerns were likely to continue to dictate sentiment.“Historical growth measures mean little given the looming financial crisis that could unhinge estimates for future growth,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “The widening of credit spreads and potential for tighter lending standards represents a significant risk to the growth outlook.”Banks are struggling to clear a backlog of debt deals that are required to fund this year’s record level of buy-outs. Debt financing for the Chrysler and AllianceBoots buy-outs ran into difficulties earlier in the week and investors say the huge pipeline of deals will not ease until the mood in credit stabilises.In other corporate news, Boeing raised its full-year earnings forecast and reported net income of $1.35 a share in the second quarter compared with a loss
of $160m, or 21 cents, a year earlier, when the company paid a $615m government fine. Its shares rose 0.8 per cent to $104.74.ConocoPhillips and Colgate-Palmolive also reported better-than-expected second quarter results, buoying sentiment during the week although ConocoPhillips finished the week down 6.3 per cent at $80.84.Colgate-Palmolive shares rose 2 per cent to $68.99.“The market’s sharp sell-off has stoked investor concern, and a surge of put-buying at significantly higher prices indicates the slide may soon provide a short-covering bounce,” said Tom McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities. Small capitalised stocks which have benefited greatly from the boom in M&A were hit hard.Traders say the risk reduction trade within equities has involved selling small- and mid-caps and seeking the relative safety of large cap stocks.Tom McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities, said: “Small-stock indexes like the Russell 2000 may enjoy a ‘beta-bounce’ if the market snaps back as we expect, but we would use strength there to reduce exposure to smaller stocks, and we continue to favour the large-capitalisation indexes, such as the S&P 500, S&P 100, or Russell Top 50.”"
587;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chevron gains from high petrol prices;;Chevron on Friday became the latest oil major to rely on high petrol prices for profit growth as it reported a 24 per cent jump in quarterly earnings in spite of only slightly rising income from oil and gas production.On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell reported an 18 per cent rise in net earnings, largely down to its refining and marketing operations, while ExxonMobil saw refinery earnings at close to record levels but suffered a 1 per cent slip in overall net income because of falling production.Production levels are under pressure because of the difficulties and high costs of accessing new reserves, which are often in remote or politically unstable locations. When crude oil prices fall, as they did slightly in the second quarter, oil companies are more reliant on profit margins from selling petrol to businesses and consumers.But refining and marketing profit margins have dropped in the third quarter as crude oil prices have risen to more than $76 a barrel, and income from production is set to grow.Chevron, the second-biggest US oil producer, said its earnings were $5.38bn in the quarter, up from $4.35bn in the same period last year. Sales were up 4.7 per cent at $54bn. Net income from refining and marketing rose by 30 per cent to $1.3bn mainly because of higher profit margins in refining.Income from exploration and production was up $367m at $3.64bn. Results last year, however, were hit by about $300m in charges from uninsured damage caused by hurricanes in the Gulf Coast.Net oil production fell 2 per cent in the US to 752,000 barrels a day and 1 per cent in international operations to 1.88m. International production was hit in part by an agreement to hand over control of operations in Venezuela to state-owned oil company PdVSA.Exxon and ConocoPhillips chose to abandon their investments in the country rather than capitulate to demands from President Hugo Chávez that the government assume majority control of the projects.But Chevron derives 6 per cent of its oil from the country, more than either of the other two companies. Dave O’Reilly, Chevron chief executive, said that negotiations with Venezuela were complete but, before committing to any future plans, Chevron would “see how we are treated there”.Chevron’s results were also lifted by the $680m sale of its investment in Dynegy.
588;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-26T20:28:39Z;S Korea stuggles to keep China at bay;;"Emblazoned across the huge blue barns of the Daewoo shipyards on Koje island, off the southern coast of South Korea, are signs declaring: “No change, no future”.Certainly, it is a frequent mantra in Korea, as Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering strive to maintain their positions at the top of the global industry.Right now, the top three are in a sweet spot – orders are rolling in fast, deep hedging means they are insulated against the strong Korean won, and their share prices have been sky-rocketing. All are frantically extending their docks and building new quays to allow them to increase capacity.“Korean shipbuilders are enjoying this very bullish market,” says Koh Young-youl, chief strategy officer at Daewoo, which has a three-year backlog of orders worth $29bn.But how long will it last? Korean shipbuilders are being threatened by China, which is set to have 23 docks for construction of large ships by 2015, many more than Korea’s 15. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers, already churning out standard container ships, are trying to make high-tech liquefied natural gas carriers and large container vessels – the Korean industry’s bread and butter.Korean estimates of the time China will take to close the technological gap range from four years to 10 years. Industry players know they must not be complacent.“At the moment China is simply building low-value-added ships, while Korea is making much more high-technology oriented ships,” says Mr Koh of Daewoo, which expected to win orders worth $11bn this year but had to revise this up to $17bn after achieving its target in the first half.“There is no serious competition from China right now but it is just a matter of time until China catches up with Korea, like Korea caught up with Japan 10 years ago,” says Mr Koh.Korea came from nowhere to become the world’s biggest shipbuilding country, and thanks largely to Hyundai, Samsung and Daewoo, has a global market share of about 40 per cent.The rise of Chinese industry has caused Korean manufacturers to look at Japan’s mistakes and make sure that they do not fall into the same trap.“Japan failed to diversify,” says Park Chung-heum, executive vice-president of project planning at Samsung Heavy, which likewise received $10bn in orders in the first half and raised its projection to $15bn.About 90 per cent of all Korean orders are for run-of-the-mill container carriers and tankers but the other 10 per cent is made up of vessels such as floating production storage and offloading oil facilities that Korean shipbuilders hope will be their future.Already Daewoo has built the Agbami FPSO vessel for Chevron, the US oil giant, for a record $1.8bn, while Hyundai Heavy Industries, Korea’s largest shipbuilder, is in the process of building a $1.6bn offshore oil production facility for Abu Dhabi Marine.Samsung is increasingly concentrating on offshore vessels such as barge-
mounted power plants and drilling rigs. It has also built an Arctic tanker for Lukoil and ConocoPhillips that can break ice that is 1.5m thick.“Six years ago the average price of a Samsung ship was $50m – or $80m at today’s prices – but now it is $170m,” Mr Park says from his office overlooking the Koje shipyards, illustrating both the sophistication of the ships being built and the recent escalation of prices shipyards can command.But all this new added value carries a risk: technology leakage. Korea’s National Intelligence Service has been investigating leaks from Korean companies to Chinese competitors and a former Daewoo employee has been arrested for selling drawings to a Chinese company.“We are very concerned about this [sort of leakage],” says Mr Park of Samsung. “Now we are putting watermarks on our drawings and we always print them on paper, not on CD. This is a very critical time and China would like to be able to catch up with Korea.”Sanjeev Rana, a ship-building analyst at Merrill Lynch in Seoul, nevertheless says Korean shipbuilders will be able to remain market leaders in high value ships at least until 2010, although he adds that this is not necessarily a recipe for success.“Korea will maintain their lead in the value added segment but they need to maintain conventional ship-building in their portfolio – you can’t have everything value added,” Mr Rana says. “So even if they increase the high tech component of their portfolio to 60 or 65 per cent, they will still be 40 or 35 per cent exposed to China.”"
589;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-26T17:50:33Z;Mild spring brings quarterly dip at Exxon;;ExxonMobil has been hit by a mild spring in Europe, which depressed natural gas prices and led to a slight fall in quarterly profits at the world’s largest oil company.Net income for the second quarter fell 1 per cent from the same period last year to $10.26bn as strong global refining and chemical margins partially compensated for the lower gas sales and prices.Earnings from refining and marketing rose 37 per cent to $3.4bn, helped by the sale of a German refinery.Lower oil production also weighed on the company earnings. Crude oil output dropped about 1 per cent to 2.67m barrels per day, surprising analysts used to the oil major’s strong performance in the field.The company blamed production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and falling output in mature oil fields, especially in the US, where supply fell by almost a 10 per cent.The earnings fall, which surprised Wall Street, could have been larger had ExxonMobil took charges for the seizure of its operations in Venezuela.However, Exxon, the world’s largest traded company, said it was too early to quantify the impact of the seizure of its operations. The company estimated the value of its project in the oil-rich Orinoco belt at $750m, but it said it was still in talks with Hugo Chávez’s government about compensation.ConocoPhillips, the third largest US oil producer, on Wednesday took a $4.51bn charge after deciding to walk away from its projects in Venezuela. The charge pushed ConocoPhillips net earnings down 94 per cent.Henry Hubble, ExxonMobil head of investor relations, said: “We are in the middle of the discussions [with the Venezuelan government]. Our view is you cannot estimate [the impact] until you are further down in the road in the talks.”ConocoPhilips and ExxonMobil were the only two western companies to walk away from the Orinoco heavy oil belt while BP, Chevron, Total of France and Statoil of Norway reached deals with Caracas.Earnings per share rose to $1.83 a share from $1.72 a share. The rise was possible because the number of Exxon’s outstanding shares dropped about 7 per cent through a buy-back scheme. Exxon spent $8.1bn on share buying in the second quarter.Analysts said that, in spite of the earnings drop, it was a good quarter for Exxon, especially in light of the problems for peer oil companies. Exxon said it anticipated less refineries turnround in the second half of the year, raising the prospects for higher earnings in the downstream business.ExxonMobil shares were 4.6 per cent down at $88.52.
590;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-25T20:44:15Z;Global Overview: Chrysler news rattles equity markets;;"Global stock markets were rattled by fears that leveraged buy-out deals could dry up in the face of increasing investor aversion to risk.Equities were unsettled after banks dealing with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ buy-out of Alliance Boots failed to sell £5bn of senior loans to fund the deal. Chrysler said it was suspending its $12bn auto loan deal and sweetening pricing terms on a further $6bn of loans.US stocks started out in fine form, jumping more than 100 points in the opening minutes after some upbeat earnings from Boeing and ConocoPhillips.Those early gains evaporated after news of the troubled takeover refinancings broke but stocks managed to rally back before the market closed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent, the S&P 500 was also up 0.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.3 per cent.European equities were hit by poor results from Siemens, the German conglomerate, and Volvo, the Swedish truckmaker. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended 0.9 per cent lower.On currency markets, risk aversion drove the dollar higher as weak US home sales data added to concerns about the housing market.Existing home sales for June fell unexpectedly sharply to 5.75m, the lowest for almost five years, adding to fears of a severe and prolonged housing slowdown. Earnings disappointments and profit warnings from corporate America have provided anecdotal evidence of the burgeoning downturn during the past few weeks. Warnings this month from DR Horton, the housebuilder, and Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, were joined on Tuesday by weak earnings from Countrywide, the mortgage lender, and USG, the building materials group. “The slowdown in the US housing market is turning uglier by the month,” said Dimitry Fleming at ING Financial Markets. “From the peak in February 2007, sales have now dropped 14 per cent.” The dollar rallied against the euro and the pound as investors cut their exposure to risk and yen-based carry trades, where the low-yielding Japanese currency is sold to fund higher-yielding purchases.Analysts said currency speculators, in unwinding some of their carry-trade positions, had sold the euro and sterling against the yen, which forced the dollar higher against both
currencies.The euro fell 0.6 per cent against the yen and 0.8 per cent against the dollar, while sterling fell 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.“A move that started with a weak dollar had the effect of helping the US currency against the euro in a classic tail wagging the dog move,” said Alan Ruskin at RBS Greenwhich Capital.The dollar climbed 0.2 per cent against the yen.Gold, which hit an 11-week high on Tuesday, fell 1.7 per cent as the dollar’s recovery prompted profit taking.Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets suggested European central banks had stepped up their gold sales to meet annual quotas set up under the Central Bank Gold Agreement.“The four-year agreement states that central banks can sell up to 500 tonnes of gold per year,” Mr Laidi said.He added: “Only two-thirds of the quota is estimated to have been sold this year, allowing central banks seven weeks to meet their quota.”Other metals were weaker as caution on commodities markets heightened after the US data.Copper fell on fears that a slowdown in the US housing market would damp demand for the metal, used in plumbing and wiring.U.S. crude prices jumped 3.2 per cent to close at $75.88 a barrel after a big fall in weekly inventories.Credit markets were further shaken as the latest monthly performance data on subprime mortgage securities, which show delinquency rates, where borrowers fail to make payments as required, were rapidly increasing.Benchmark ABX indices, which are created every six months to track the credit risk of loans made in the previous six-month period, hit record lows on Wednesday following the data.Government bonds prices were a touch firmer. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was a little lower at 4.90 per cent, after earlier falling below 4.9 per cent, a seven-week low, while the yield on the 10-year Bund had fallen to 4.40 per cent."

Its shares were up 24 per cent or $15.34 at $84.59 at midday in New York.Amazon’s share price gains were fuelled as JP Morgan lifted its rating from ”underweight” to ”neutral”, saying it sees strong revenue growth in 2007 and 2008. It added that Amazon’s valuation ”provides limited upside.”At the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent at 1,518.09, the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,648.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 13,785.07.The materials sector, fell about 1.1 per cent. All other sectors, bar semiconductors, were positive for the day.Volatility remained very high. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “It used to be the case that as stocks went up, volatility went down. “That relationship is coming apart at the seams these days with investors keen to buy the CBOE Vix index futures and options with the specific aim of protecting portfolios from a downturn in the broad market.”He added that the Vix index rose on Wednesday even as the Dow and S&P 500 roseEarnings remained a sharp focus for investors.Before the opening bell, Boeing raised its full-year earnings forecast and reported net income of $1.35 a share in the second quarter compared with a loss
of $160m, or 21 cents, a year earlier, when the company paid a $615m government fine.Its shares rose 3.3 per cent to $107.23. Boeing also said it was on track to deliver the first 787 Dreamliner in May, although research and development costs for the fuel-saving jet – which has generated more orders than any new aircraft in history – have risen.ConocoPhillips and Colgate Palmolive also reported better than expected second quarter results, buoying sentiment.ConocoPhillips shares were up 2.4 per cent at $84.21. Colgate Palmolive shares rose 2.1 per cent to $69.66 after the company reported second-quarter profit was $415.8m, or 76 cents per share, compared with $283.6m, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.Apple was set to report after the market close. Its shares lost 6 per cent on Tuesday on concerns about weaker than expected sales of the iPhone from AT&T, but regained 1.8 per cent to close at $137.26.In economic news, the pace of existing home sales fell to its lowest for more than four years in June, according to the latest reading on the state of the battered property market.Home resales fell to a 5.75m annual rate, a 3.8 per cent decrease from May’s revised 5.98m annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said.May’s rate had been estimated at 5.99m.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress last week that he expected housing demand to stabilise and housing to be a less severe drag on growth in the coming months.US economic activity expanded further in June and early July, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, as slower housing markets were offset by gains in manufacturing and commercial real estate.In deal news, medical diagnostics provider Dade Behring Holdings rose 32.8 per cent to $74.26 after Siemens agreed to buy it for $77 a share.A 70 per cent profit rise for NutriSystem was not enough, with shares down 10.8 per cent at $56.90 as the company’s third-quarter outlook fell below analyst expectations.Corning said second-quarter net income fell 5.7 per cent on charges related to an asbestos settlement. Corning’s LCD business remained strong, while its telecommunications segment was weaker than expected. Corning shares were down 6.5 per cent at $24.48.Wellpoint posted an 11 per cent rise in second-quarter profit on Wednesday as the largest US health insurer by enrolment increased its membership from a year earlier and better controlled administrative costs. Shares in Wellpoint fell 2.7 per cent to $79.99.Alexion Pharmaceuticals shares rose 17.5 per cent to $58.38 after the biotechnology company’s quarterly loss narrowed, beating analysts’ expectations."
592;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-25T14:26:15Z;Conoco feels the Chávez effect;;Hugo Chávez’s moves to take control of foreign oil investments in Venezuela caused a 94 per cent drop in ConocoPhillips’ earnings in the second quarter, as the company warned that future production would be hit because of the loss of assets in the country.Conoco, the third largest US oil producer, said its net income had been hit by a $4.51bn charge after it decided to walk away from its projects in the oil-rich Orinoco belt, rather than accept the terms being forced on it by Mr Chávez.The Venezuelan president announced a month ago that the national oil company PDVSA was taking control of the reserves, worth at least $25bn, in the Orinoco region, in eastern Venezuela.ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company, also failed to agree to terms with Venezuela. BP, Statoil, Chevron and Total had previously accepted the new terms.Conoco was particularly badly hit by the move, as its operations in Orinoco were valued at about $6bn and account for about 10 per cent of its reserves.On Wednesday, Conoco said its second quarter net profit fell to $301m from $5.19bn in the same period a year ago because of the charge. Revenues rose 0.6 per cent to $47.4bn. Excluding the charge, earnings fell seven per cent to $4.81bn, or $2.90 a share. Analysts polled by Reuters expected earnings of $2.68 a share.The charge on Conoco’s profits came in its exploration and production division, which fell to a $2.4bn loss in the quarter, down from net income of $3.31bn last year. Earnings in the division were also hit by lower crude oil prices, lower sales and higher taxes.The company said that the seizure of its Venezuela oil projects would contribute to lower production in the third quarter.”We continue negotiations with the Venezuela government concerning appropriate compensation for the expropriation of the company’s oil projects and have preserved all legal rights, including international arbitration,” said Jim Mulva, chairman and chief executive officer.Analysts at Bank of America said in a recent note that “the economic impact [of the loss of its Venezuelan] operations should be negligible going forward”.The loss was partially offset by a 38 per cent jump in net income from the company’s refining and marketing arm compared with last year, to $2.36bn, thanks to higher margins and lower costs relating to the impact of Hurricane Katrina two years ago.The company’s 20 per cent stake in Russian oil company Lukoil also paid off, with net income from the investment rising 36 per cent to $526m.Shares in Conoco rose by $1.37, or 1.7 per cent, to $83.70 in early trading.
593;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-24T22:11:37Z;Norsk Hydro hopes for Shtokman stake;;Norsk Hydro said on Tuesday it was still keen to participate in the development of Russia’s vast Shtokman gas field and was continuing to talk to Gazprom about taking a stake in the project.Eivind Reiten, chief executive of the Norwegian oil and aluminium group, said there was still a chance for Norsk Hydro to get involved in Shtokman in spite of Gazprom’s choice of Total of France as its main development partner.Total agreed this month to buy a 25 per cent stake in the new company being set up to develop Shtokman, one of the world’s largest untapped gas fields. Gazprom plans to keep a controlling stake of at least 51 per cent, leaving 24 per cent potentially available to other investors.“We are in continued dialogue with Gazprom,” said Mr Reiten. “We are closely interested in taking a share [in Shtokman] if the conditions are right.” ConocoPhillips of the US is also thought to be interested in investingNorsk Hydro is in the process of merging its oil division with Statoil, its larger Norwegian rival, to create a national energy champion. A deal is due to complete on October 1 and the new group will temporarily be known as StatoilHydro but there are plans to adopt a new name next year.Mr Reiten will stay on as chief executive of Hydro Aluminium. The Norwegian government will continue to own 43 per cent of the group, making it unlikely that Norsk Hydro will become a takeover target. But Mr Reiten said his group could get involved in consolidation sweeping the aluminium industry as an acquirer. “We certainly have the financial capacity and appetite for growth.”Norsk Hydro results for the second quarter showed a dip in pre-tax profits. Revenues fell to NKr46.5bn ($8.1) from NKr48bn in the second quarter of 2006 while earnings before financial items and tax fell to NKr14.2bn from NKr15.6bn. The drop was mainly a result of lower oil and gas production following maintenance shutdowns at more than half of Norsk Hydro’s main fields.Aluminium production was roughly flat on previous quarters in spite of the closure of high-cost aluminium smelting capacity in Germany and Norway.Shares in Norsk Hydro fell NKr5.25 to NKr233.5.
594;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-22T21:35:42Z;China oil braves hostile terrain in Somalia;;CNOOC’s willingness to strike an oil deal with the fragile government of Somalia, which has been a failed state for more than a decade, has provided stark evidence of China’s willingness to brave terrain that western oil majors deem too treacherous.The state-owned Chinese oil giant has signed a production-sharing deal with the transitional federal government in the east African country, which ranks as a high-risk frontier even in an industry well accustomed to dangerous environments.In doing so, CNOOC and its smaller partner, China International Oil and Gas, are gambling on three points. First, that the interim government has the authority to make such deals and will stay in power. Second, that violence stemming from perennial inter-clan conflicts and more recently Islamist extremism will not derail its work. Third – and most fundamentally – that the country has some oil worth extracting.Several western oil majors held exploration concessions in Somalia in the 1980s, but fled in 1991 when the overthrow of dictator Siad Barre ushered in 16 years of chaos.Ali Mohamed Gedi, Somalia’s interim prime minister, told the Financial Times last week that ConocoPhillips, Chevron, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Eni would be invited to return and change their concessions into production-sharing agreements under a new oil law due to be published in the next two months.But that looks like a distant prospect. BP, Shell and Eni say they still consider the concession deals to be subject to force majeure – code for unexpected and disruptive events that prevent contractual obligations from being met. Chevron and ConocoPhillips have declined to comment.Thomas O’Connor, chairman of Benchmark Oil and Gas and a former World Bank oil engineer who studied Somalia, says: “Many of the companies there in the 1980s have been subsumed into others and the bigger they get the more conservative they become. The super majors will likely talk about it internally, but my guess is the legal counsels will say ‘No, let’s wait until the dust settles’.”Chris Brown, a sub-Saharan Africa analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, says: “The big issue at the moment is there are three different governments issuing exploration contracts, hence the legitimacy of these licences may be thrown in doubt if there were to be any change in the political landscape.”The government of Somaliland, a northern province that considers itself independent, struck a production-sharing agreement with Ophir Energy in 2003. The government of the semi-autonomous Puntland province has given Range Resources of Australia and Canmex Minerals of Canada joint exploration rights in part of the region.CNOOC’s deal – details of which emerged last week – covers another part of Puntland and was endorsed by President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, who hails from the province, even though the transitional government’s authority there is tenuous. The prime minister himself has questioned the validity of the Chinese agreement because it was signed before the new oil law is in place.Mr O’Connor says: “Big oil companies are loath to go into dodgy areas where they don’t have good contractual relationships. But the Chinese are taking the view: ‘Let’s just do it and deal with the consequences later.’ It’s buccaneering.”CNOOC has acquired a reputation for risk-taking – a reflection of the fact it is ultimately serving China’s strategic need for oil rather than purely commercial objectives.Insecurity in Somalia was underlined last Thursday when the re-opening of a conference intended to promote reconciliation between the country’s clans, warlords and political factions was marred by bomb attacks that killed at least five children near the Mogadishu venue.Range Resources estimates that Puntland has the potential to yield 5bn-10bn barrels of oil.The US Energy Information Administration, however, says the country has no proved oil reserves.Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty in Houston
595;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-16T17:36:06Z;Somali PM ‘unaware’ of Chinese oil deal;;"Somalia’s interim prime minister has sought to distance himself from a decision to grant oil exploration rights to CNOOC, indicating that the Chinese state oil giant may have become entangled in an internal power struggle within the interim government.CNOOC and a smaller group, China International Oil and Gas, are planning to begin survey work in the Puntland province later this year – the latest example of China’s willingness to brave Africa’s most volatile regions in search of natural resources.But Ali Mohamed Gedi, prime minister, told the Financial Times he had not seen the agreement granting the Chinese groups exploration rights. “I’m not aware of this. I don’t know anything about it,” he said in an interview in Nairobi.He added that no valid deals could be struck until the country’s interim parliament had endorsed a new oil law due to be published in the next two months.The FT, however, has seen a document signed by president Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, who is from Puntland, that granted two Somali officials power of attorney to sign a production-sharing agreement with CNOOC Africa and CIOG in Beijing on May 24 last year. At the time, the transitional government had little authority outside its base in Baidoa.Last month Somalia’s energy minister met with the heads of CNOOC Africa and CIOG in Nairobi to hammer out the details of their planned survey work.One western diplomat who follows Somalia said it would be no surprise to find the president and prime minister working independently of each other. “They don’t really get on. They’re from different clans,” he said. “They have differences and divergences, but they tolerate each other.”CNOOC in Beijing last week declined to comment on any aspect of the deal over exploration rights.Mr Gedi on Monday emphasised the importance of putting a national oil law in place. “There are many companies interested in exploring oil and gas in Somalia, but in order to protect the wealth of the country and the interests of the Somali people, we cannot operate without a regulatory body, without rules and regulations,” he said.He was aware of “informal contacts” between his government and oil companies, including Chinese groups and some of the western oil groups that held exploration concessions in the 1980s.Asked how oil groups would feel about one of their rivals striking a deal ahead of the oil law, he said: “Life is up and down. Today yes, tomorrow no. Tomorrow yes, the day after, no. But I believe those who are interested in the oil business in Somalia will be received after the petrol law is endorsed by parliament.”In the late 1980s exploration concessions were held by companies including Conoco and Phillips, which have merged; Amoco, now part of BP; and Chevron. These groups left the country after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown during civil war in 1991.According to the US Energy Information Administration, Somalia has no proven oil reserves and only 200bn cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, which have not been tapped.But Range Resources, an oil group listed in Sydney, estimates that the Puntland province has the potential to yield 5bn-10bn barrels of oil."
596;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-15T18:09:44Z;ConocoPhillips;;Surely $15bn should be enough to assuage anyone’s doubts about ConocoPhillips? Not quite. Buying back about a 10th of its shares addresses acquisition risk for a company that has spent much of the past decade buying its way into the top league of international oil majors. Conoco’s market capitalisation now stands at $147bn. However, its last big deal, buying gas producer Burlington Resources for $36bn, was struck in December 2005, just as the US gas price hit $15 per million British thermal units. The price has averaged $7 since then.Returning cash to shareholders should also cheer (placate?) activist funds such as Atticus Capital, which has built a $2.2bn stake in Conoco. The buyback appears to lend weight to the argument that Conoco’s stock, trading at a 13 per cent discount to the sector on a 2007 price/earnings multiple, is undervalued. The shares have risen 11 per cent since the buyback was announced.Yet these positive arguments obscure sizeable challenges. AG Edwards estimates three-quarters of Conoco’s upstream production comes from mature regions such as the North Sea and the US. Their relatively lenient fiscal regimes make for big profits at high energy prices. But their rapid decline rates demand high capital intensity and cast doubt on Conoco meeting its 3 per cent upstream production growth target.Venezuela’s nationalisation last month of a 10th of Conoco’s reserves compounds the issue – Deutsche Bank now forecasts output will actually decline by the end of the decade. On that basis, a clear statement that Conoco is not out shopping for more barrels was a necessity. Yet without that option, Conoco looks set to remain a mix of largely high-cost upstream assets and leverage to notoriously volatile US refining margins. In today’s environment of record crude prices and refining bottlenecks, the market can live with that. For an “international oil major”, though, it is hardly the most compelling long-term proposition.
597;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-12T09:57:01Z;Gazprom picks Total for Shtokman field;;Gazprom said on Thursday it had chosen Total of France as a partner in developing its vast Shtokman gas field, ending months of indecision over foreign participation. It added that more partners could join.Analysts said such a deal could have been agreed only at the highest level. The Kremlin said Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, and Nicolas Sarkozy, his French counterpart, had spoken on the phone on Wednesday.Norsk Hydro, Statoil and Conoco­Phillips are understood to be still in the running to join the new partnership.Conoco said on Thursday: “We remain interested in participating in the development of Shtokman and we maintain a steady dialogue with Gazprom, but can provide no further detail.”Statoil, which is merging with Hydro, said: “Our dialogue with Gazprom has not yet been concluded. We aim to find a solution that is suitable for both parties.”Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller said Total would receive a 25 per cent stake in a new company that would own the infrastructure to run the $20bn project. One or more other foreign partners could take a further stake of up to 24 per cent. Gazprom would keep at least a 51 per cent controlling stake.Both Gazprom and Total said they expected a final deal to be signed on Friday.The decision breaks a logjam on foreign participation that had held up development of the Arctic field, which holds more than 3,000bn cubic metres of gas. Mr Miller said pipeline deliveries would begin in 2013, liquefied natural gas deliveries in 2014.But the arrangement is firmly in line with the new Russian paradigm of state control for major new energy projects.The choice of partner surprised the market. Although Total was one of five short-listed partners in talks with Gazprom last year, the Russian group had been thought to favour a deal with Hydro and Statoil of Norway, or Chevron or Conoco of the US.But amid worsening relations with the west, Gazprom said last autumn it would develop the field alone, with foreign companies brought in as contractors. In effect, Thursday’s decision marks a compromise. Gazprom will be the sole owner of the company that holds the licence to the field, while Total and possible other partners will participate in the company that runs the project, which will allow them to share both the profits and the risks.
598;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-10T21:21:47Z;Oil supplies are down and alternatives not yet available;;"A rule of thumb for the price of oil in the past five years has been to take the last digit of the year and add a zero: 2002 saw prices in the $20s; 2003 in the $30s; now oil is hovering around $70 a barrel. These high prices are desirable for steering the economy away from oil, but in the meantime they could also spell trouble. Oil companies need to adjust to this new reality and rethink their business model.The latest report by the International Energy Agency warns of an oil supply crunch in five years. Demand is expected to rise at more than 2 per cent annually. Supply, the IEA calculates, will not be able to keep pace. Nations outside the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are expected to add about 1 per cent to supplies per year. That puts most of the burden on Opec, in particular Saudi Arabia, which would face capacity constraints itself, the IEA says.In many ways, the rising oil price points to a market at work: demand is up, supply is lagging and prices rise. That high price should fuel a search for alternative sources of energy and lead to more exploration and exploitation of oil supplies. Yet the IEA reckons that ethanol and other biofuels will not be ready to make a sufficiently significant dent in the market within five years.The report also notes a disconnect between higher dividend payments to shareholders and little real change in exploration and production activities. On this analysis, oil majors are enjoying the fruits of past investments without providing adequately for their own financial future. This week, ConocoPhillips became the latest major to announce a share buy-back, on which it will spend $15bn.These moves make some corporate sense now, given the mix of physical shortages and political risks: some regimes with cheap oil, such as Iran and Iraq, are unlikely to add capacity any time soon.Yet the oil majors’ actions do not address the wider question of the world’s energy resources in future. This requires the majors to rethink their business model. National oil companies have most of the oil, but face production constraints. Many of the skills to extract that oil rest with the majors. Instead of focusing on developing their own resources, they should be willing to sell their expertise to state-owned firms that have the oil but lack some of the skills to get it out.This approach will mean lower profit margins, but should help to avert the threat of a popular backlash against the oil majors. More importantly, it looks like the best hope of mitigating the looming energy crunch."
599;COP;Conocophillips;2007-07-08T21:01:39Z;Gazprom close to Shtokman gas field deal;;"Gazprom is “very close” to a deal to develop the vast Shtokman gas field in Russia, making a concession to international energy groups by allowing foreign companies to be partners in the project, according to one of the company’s top executives.Signing a deal to develop one of the world’s biggest gas reserves would be an important success for any of the three groups that have been in talks with Gazprom: Statoil and Norsk Hydro of Norway, which are in the process of merging, Total of France and ConocoPhillips of the US. The cost of the project has been estimated at $20bn-$30bn.The comments made by Alexander Medvedev, who is in effect Gazprom’s deputy chief executive, show a softening of the Russian company’s position from last October, when it said international companies could not take equity stakes in the licence for Shtokman and could work on the project only as contractors.Mr Medvedev told the Financial Times that Gazprom was in talks with foreign companies about a “new model” of co-operation that would “allow foreign partners to share in the economic benefits of the project, share the management, and take on a share of the industrial, commercial and financial risks”.That could be done by giving international oil companies stakes in the company running the project, rather than in the Gazprom subsidiary that owns the Shtokman licence.Mr Medvedev said he expected the project to produce its first gas in 2013, and begin shipments of liquefied natural gas in 2014. The revival of the plan to include an LNG plant in the project, which could supply the US, also represents a reversal from last year, when Gazprom suggested it would prefer to sell the gas to Europe through a pipeline.Gazprom’s concession in allowing equity participation for foreign companies reflects a recognition that it needs their expertise for such a difficult field.Shtokman lies more than 500km off Russia’s north coast, in 350m of water. The Arctic conditions make production challenging; not least because of the threat of icebergs.The potential, however, is enormous. Shtokman’s reserves have been estimated at 3,200bn-3,700bn cubic metres of gas; enough to supply Russia’s entire gas production for five to six years.Jonathan Stern of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies warned that even with the participation of foreign partners, 2013 looked an ambitious target date."
600;COP;Conocophillips;2007-06-27T20:36:05Z;PdVSA shoulders Chávez’s revolution;;President Hugo Chávez’s “Bolivarian Revolution” would not have got very far were it not for his ability to draw on the vast resources of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PdVSA.The group, which accounts for a third of gross domestic product and half of government revenues, is the lynchpin of economic performance in Venezuela, the largest oil exporter in the western hemisphere. And its importance is growing.On Tuesday, PdVSA almost doubled its stake from an average of 40 per cent to a higher-than-expected 78 per cent in four major oil projects with a combined value of at least $25bn in the Orinoco Belt, which contains the largest heavy oil reserves in the world.ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil said they would withdraw from the country after apparently refusing to agree to new terms of their participation. The deal will put a greater burden on PdVSA, whose financial and human resources are already feared to be stretched.“It will be more expensive for us to break with the companies and look for new partners,” says Mario Isea, president of the Venezuelan National Assembly’s hydrocarbons commission.Negotiations may continue for some time with the companies that are remaining – Chevron, Total, BP and Statoil – as they concern complex issues including new governance structures and compensation for the companies’ reduced shares.Analysts fear that the transition of control of the Orinoco projects could lead to big problems. “There is no possibility of a drastic fall in production, although there could be a slight drop in the short term,” says Mr Isea.Other people question whether PdVSA’s limited human and financial resources are enough to deal with the multiple projects it is burdened with, which extend beyond oil.There is concern that the use of oil wealth to bankroll the introduction of what Mr Chávez calls “21st century socialism” to Venezuela has prevented PdVSA from investing in exploration and development.Revenues have more than doubled in the past decade in real terms due to rising oil prices, but PdVSA’s production has fallen 16 per cent since 2001, Opec said.PdVSA’s funds channelled towards social programmes almost doubled in 2006 to $13.3bn, while heavily subsidised domestic oil consumption costs about $9bn a year.“I don’t like this system in which the energy minister is also president of PdVSA,” says Luis Lander, a leftwing academic at the Central University of Venezuela. He fears that PdVSA has become too politicised.“There are signs that PdVSA is getting mixed up in too many things that are nothing to do with oil,” he says, even though he favours the use of Venezuela’s oil wealth to stimulate other sectors of the economy.Although PdVSA accepts a need for foreign investment to achieve its plans – which include roughly doubling oil production to almost 6m barrels per day by 2012 – neither foreign companies nor PdVSA are investing according to schedule, says Mazhar al-Shereidah, one of Venezuela’s leading energy experts.
601;COP;Conocophillips;2007-06-27T20:36:05Z;Oil majors tread pragmatic path;;"Confronted by Hugo Chávez’s determination to take control of Venezuela’s heavy oil upgraders, the international oil companies were between a rock and a hard place.They could either accept participation on the new terms, in which they would be junior partners to PdVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, and expected to write cheques for new investment over which they would not have full control – or walk away from assets worth billions of dollars.Faced with that decision on Tuesday, Chevron of the US, Total of France, BP of the UK and Statoil of Norway chose to bite their lips and stick around.ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil of the US have walked away.For Exxon, the calculation, while painful, was straightforward. It has built a reputation for being a company that regards contracts as sacrosanct and expects its partners to do the same.With delicate negotiations over its Sakhalin-1 project in Russia under way, it would have been madness to throw that reputation away.If it could not do a deal with Venezuela on acceptable terms, the cost – losing about 1 per cent of its production – was a price worth paying.For Conoco, however, the cost of leaving is much higher and analysts had generally expected it would try to stay.Last year, it made about 4 per cent of its production and had about 10 per cent of its reserves in Venezuela.Its shares lost 3 per cent on Tuesday, although they steadied yesterday. It expects to write off $4.5bn for its lost assets.Exxon said in a statement yesterday that “we continue discussions with the Venezuelan government on a way forward”, even though it was clear that it was giving up its stake in Cerro Negro, one of the four upgraders turning Venezuela’s heavy oil into crude so it can be sold on world markets.Robert de By, of Dewey Ballantine, the law firm, said it might sound too late for talks, adding: “It is a bit like being on the ground being robbed – you can say ‘I’m still talking’ but is the robber listening?”But he said Venezuela was unlikely to want to cut itself off from the world economy by expropriating assets without compensation.Verizon of the US was paid what was seen as a reasonable price for its stake in CANTV, a Venezuelan telecommunications company, in February.Ultimately, Exxon and Conoco can go to arbitration, as Eni of Italy is seeking to do over a conventional oil project in Venezuela that was taken over last year, at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.That would be a long, hard road, however.Given the difficulties that could lie ahead, it is understandable that the other companies have chosen not to go down that path; particularly as one side-effect of the Exxon and Conoco withdrawal is that some of their stakes will be cut less severely than they had feared.Chevron, for example, is retaining its 30 per cent holding in the Hamaca project and BP its 16.7 per cent stake in Cerro Negro.For international oil companies, such difficulties are an increasingly common fact of life. Resource-rich countries have taken advantage of high oil prices to exert greater influence.Chevron, BP, Total and Statoil are left with the potential for future development in a country that has some of the largest oil resources in the world.Venezuela’s heavy oil reserves are estimated at 270bn barrels; on a par with Saudi Arabia’s 260bn.“When all the oil in the world has run out, Venezuela will be one of the last countries turning its taps off,” says Derek Butter of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. “Unlike many countries with large reserves, Venezuela is not closed to foreign investment, and there will be plenty of companies still willing to invest there.”Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty and Benedict Mander"
602;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chávez gets his oil;;Even authoritarian populists are capable of rational economic thought when it matters. Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s president, has again decided to take over billion-dollar projects from the oil majors. With the price of crude hovering around $70 per barrel, that plainly makes economic sense for him.ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, the two majors most hurt by this announcement, will find little consolation in the fact that this latest sign of resource nationalism takes a different form from simply having all assets expropriated and being shown the door. Both were offered minority stakes in the project – in part because PdVSA, the state-owned company taking over, would like to use their expertise.The Orinoco belt oil fields in question are rich with heavy crude. They served as a testing ground in the 1990s for the oil majors, which developed new technologies specifically for extracting, transporting and refining the gluey mass. In exchange, international companies received favourable terms. Since then the price of oil has quadrupled, so the majors’ returns have been well above expectations.It is only natural for Mr Chávez to demand a larger share of that oil wealth. Ideology, of course, also plays a role here, but Venezuela is scarcely alone. The UK has increased its corporation tax on oil company profits and many other countries from Russia to the US have tried to extract higher royalties in recent years.Venezuela opened up to money from abroad in the 1990s for investment in its resource sector. That proved helpful when countries vied for capital, but now the bargain has changed. Majors have more money than chances to invest it. Mr Chávez knows that well.None of this should deflect from how bad is the health of the Venezuelan oil industry. PdVSA is a poor choice to take the lead in any oil project. The company is largely a political vehicle. After a general strike, Mr Chávez fired 18,000 managers and technicians in 2002. The company and its production has yet to recover.But as long as the price of oil is four times higher than 10 years ago, it scarcely matters that the amount of oil produced in Venezuela has declined by more than 10 per cent in that time.Mr Chávez still has enough oil money for his populist ambitions, and he will continue to rely on the majors’ expertise, if not their capital. Oil companies need to recognise this new reality and, while the oil price is high, barter their technical skills for a share of the spoils that are going to oil-rich governments.
603;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
604;COP;Conocophillips;2007-06-27T00:16:52Z;Venezuela takes over US oil projects;;Venezuela’s state-owned oil company is taking over multibillion-dollar projects owned by ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, Rafael Ramirez, the country’s energy minister, said.The action was being taken following a failure to agree the terms of a handover of operations in the oil-rich Orinoco belt, said Mr Ramirez.The oil groups refused to sign an agreement on how the Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PdVSA would take majority control of heavy crude oil projects in the Orinoco belt, which are valued at a total of at least $25bn.The loss of its Venezuelan operations would be a particular blow to ConocoPhillips. Its operations in the Orinoco belt were valued at about $6bn and accounted for about 10 per cent of the company’s reserve base and 4 per cent of its worldwide production.Mr Ramirez said PdVSA was increasing its share in the four projects, which lie above some of he largest heavy crude oil reserves in the world, from an average of 40 per cent to 78 per cent.Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s president, announced the state takeover of majority control of operations in the Orinoco belt this year, along with the nationalisation of Venezuela’s largest electricity and telephone companies.Mr Ramirez, who is also the president of PdVSA, said Chevron, Total, BP and Statoil had said they would sign agreements allowing them to continue operating in the area, which can produce 600,000 barrels of oil a day, a quarter of Venezuela’s output.However, analysts said that both ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, which was the most exposed of the private companies in the Orinoco, refused to accept minority positions in the ventures for compensation that they considered to be below market value. The companies appeared still to be in talks with Venezuela over the handover.Petro-Canada also pulled out of the country, saying: “We have decided not to migrate to the new commercial structure, so our working interest passes to the Venezuelan government.”Analysts said the country needed the expertise of private companies. Venezuela’s oil industry has stagnated in recent years, with production falling 10 per cent during the past decade.ExxonMobil said it was “disappointed that we have been unable to reach an agreement on the terms for migration to a mixed enterprise structure. However, we continue discussions with the Venezuelan government on a way forward.”ConocoPhillips said it expected to take an impairment of about $4.5bn in the second quarter for its entire interest in its Venezuelan oil projects as negotiations continued with authorities over compensation for the company’s stake in the projects.The Orinoco belt could contain 270bn barrels of oil, an amount that would leave Venezuela with the largest reserves in the world – above Saudi Arabia and Canada.
605;COP;Conocophillips;2007-06-19T17:32:07Z;Animal plan incites pork-barrel politics;;Any future market for bio­fuels will depend on the stance of the US, the world’s biggest consumer of transport fuels. But Washington’s propensity for pork-barrel politics means that the push for biofuels must negotiate a complex array of tax breaks and subsidies.The response to a plan by ConocoPhillips and Tyson Foods to produce “renewable biodiesel” from animal fats is emblematic.Conoco and Tyson’s plan would use new technology to process and blend animal fats from the food group’s herds and flocks with conventional diesel to produce an initial 175m gallons a year of fuel. However, its commercial viability hinges on a $1 a gallon tax credit in part of the 2005 Energy Act, which opponents maintain was not intended for Conoco and Tyson’s programme.“Every place in the world, you lose money without a credit,” said Lou Burke, the US energy group’s head of alternative fuels last week after Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic congressman from cattle and oil-rich Texas, introduced a bill that would repeal the tax break and ruin the economics of the programme.The plan has managed to upset just about everyone bar its backers. Animal rights activists claim it would push more cows towards Tyson’s abattoirs. The National Biodiesel Board argues that the entry of oil groups such as Conoco would spell doom for dozens of small producers. Even the Soap and Detergent Association has weighed in, saying that the diversion of its core feedstock could make the industry extinct.Biodiesel remains a tiny fraction of US alternative fuel output but the pattern of subsidy and support can be seen across the industry. The 2005 Energy Act and its once-lofty targets for renewable fuels, as well as more ambitious goals in the president’s State of the Union address this year, have unleashed the worst of pork-barrel politics.“The subsidies have created demand for something that wouldn’t have been there,” said Mark Williams, an energy expert at Boston University.The ethanol sector already benefits from a 51 cents-a-gallon federal subsidy, as well as assorted state benefits and 54 cents-a-gallon import tariffs which keep the flow of less expensive sugar-derived ethanol from Brazil to a trickle.Ethanol is expected to swallow a quarter of US corn production this year and food producers – led by Dick Bond, Tyson chief executive – warn of a ripple effect on global prices as animal feed prices increase and farmers substitute grain for other crops to take advantage of high prices. While $4 a bushel corn still leaves the new breed of plants – producing 100m gallons of ethanol a year – in profitable territory, equity investors can no longer expect the 40-50 per cent returns forecast last year when the crop was trading at between $3 and $3.50.The ever-larger plants producing ever more ethanol, and the scale of external investment – much of it from private equity funds – also highlight how control of the rural economy is continuing to drift away from farmers.Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City estimate that 70 per cent of ethanol plants built from 1998-2005 were farmer-owned, with communities clubbing together to build facilities producing about 50m gallons a year apiece. By last year, however, this had fallen to just 10 per cent.
606;COP;Conocophillips;2007-06-17T21:04:07Z;Higgs wants ‘quarantine’ for advisers;;Sir Derek Higgs, one of the most widely respected authorities on corporate governance, has advised that company directors should have a “quarantine” period before taking the increasingly popular retirement role of senior adviser to an investment bank.Senior, or “international”, advisers have become widespread in global investment banks and are sometimes organised into formal regional advisory boards.The appointees are often former directors of companies that were clients of the bank, and this has triggered concern that banks are using them as deferred rewards for lucrative advisory mandates.Sir Derek, the Alliance & Leicester chairman, said: “I would hate to think there should be a [formal] code, but there should be an acceptance that too much haste is unseemly. There is no reason why the civil service principle – that there should be a period of quarantine – should not apply in the corporate world. That is common sense.”Guy Jubb, head of corporate governance at Standard Life Investments, said the increasing prevalence of senior adviser appointments underscored the need for boards to have robust processes for appointing investment banks.The Association of British Insurers said its members had not raised the subject with its executive, and the investor body would not act “unless they did”.Maurice Thompson, chairman of investment banking in continental Europe at Citigroup, said: “For Citi, this has been a great model. Our German advisory board – its credibility, relationships, connectivity and judgment – accelerated our development in the country. None of its members got there because of business they had given us in the past.”In April, UBS appointed Sir Julian Horn-Smith, former deputy chief executive of Vodafone, a longstanding client, as a senior adviser. UBS’s advisers also include Uwe-Ernst Bufe, former Degussa chief executive.Credit Suisse’s senior advisory board includes Sir Roy Gardner, the former chief executive of Centrica, and Paolo Fresco, the former chief executive of Fiat.Deutsche Bank’s include Michael Capellas, the former chief executive of MCI, and Archie Dunham, former chairman of ConocoPhillips. Morgan Stanley receives the counsel of Sir Brian Pitman, former chief executive of Lloyds TSB.Sir Julian endorsed the idea of a quarantine period. “It is important that there are safeguards to make sure [favouritism towards investments banks] does not happen,” he said. “Possibly a cooling off period of six months is a good idea. But don’t overdo it, otherwise people who have a valuable contribution to make to the economy will be left on the sidelines.”Sir Julian said he had felt that such a period would be appropriate for him when he left Vodafone in July last year, and Arun Sarin, the chief executive, had agreed. He joined UBS in April, nine months later.He said that there was no link between his joining UBS and Vodafone’s decision to give it investment banking work when he was with the company. He said that compliance within investment banking was sufficiently rigorous to prevent banks using such appointments as rewards for previous work.“I had never thought of joining an investment bank,” he said. “It was not at all a factor [when choosing advisers]. We appointed advisers as a team, and sometimes [we chose] UBS.”Sir Julian is understood to have first been approached by Credit Suisse about such a role and that UBS approached him after learning of this.
607;COP;Conocophillips;2007-06-17T21:04:06Z;‘Quarantine’ call for bank adviser roles;;Sir Derek Higgs, one of the UK’s most widely respected authorities on corporate governance, has advised that company directors should have a “quarantine” period before taking the increasingly popular retirement role of senior adviser to an investment bank.Senior, or “international”, advisers have become widespread in global investment banks and are sometimes organised into formal regional advisory boards.However, the appointments are often former directors of companies that were clients of the bank, and this has triggered concern that banks are using them as deferred rewards for lucrative advisory mandates.The Alliance & Leicester chairman said: “I would hate to think there should be a [formal] code, but there should be an acceptance that too much haste is unseemly. There is no reason why the civil service principle – that there should be a period of quarantine – should not apply in the corporate world. That is common sense.”Guy Jubb, head of corporate governance at Standard Life Investments, says the increasing prevalence of senior adviser appointments underscores the need for boards to have robust processes for appointing investment banks.However, the Association of British Insurers said its members had not raised the subject with its executive, and the investor body would not act “unless they did”.In April, UBS appointed Sir Julian Horn-Smith, former deputy chief executive of Vodafone, a longstanding client of the firm, as a senior adviser.

608;COP;Conocophillips;2007-05-30T00:13:07Z;BP lands $900m gas deal with Libya;;BP, the global energy group, on Tuesday night announced a $900m (£455m) gas exploration deal with Libya, in a sign of Tripoli’s transformation from pariah to attractive investment destination for UK and US companies.Tony Hayward, BP’s new chief executive, described the agreement as the group’s “single biggest exploration commitment”. The deal coincides with a visit to Tripoli by Tony Blair, the outgoing UK prime minister.Describing the planned contract as “unthinkable” only a decade ago, Mr Blair said after a meeting last night with Muammar Gadaffi, Libya’s leader: “The relationship between Libya and Britain has completely transformed in the past three years.” Investment links were “going from strength to strength”.US and British energy companies have been scrambling to get back into Libya over the past two years to secure a share of the country’s largely unexplored gas and oil reserves.Their return follows the lifting of sanctions after Tripoli abandoned weapons of mass destruction and resolved the crisis over the 1988 bombing of an aircraft over Lockerbie, Scotland.Some analysts said on Tuesday that BP was “a little behind the curve”, returning to Libya after oil groups including Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips. BP will also have to vie with companies long established in the north African country, such as Italy’s Eni and Spain’s Repsol.Analysts on Tuesday said BP needed to expand in new areas, especially as it faced the threat of losing its licence to exploit one of its main Russian assets, the Kovykta gas field. “As Russia becomes more of a risk, BP’s portfolio starts to look weaker compared with Shell’s,” said Oswald Clint, oil analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “Opportunities are few and far between, and BP needs to grasp all the opportunities it can.”BP withdrew from Libya in 1974 when the country’s oil industry was nationalised by Colonel Gadaffi. But early last year the company said it was in early-stage talks about gas projects.A delegation of BP executives, including Mr Hayward, were in the Libyan capital last night as Mr Blair arrived in Tripoli for the beginning of his trip, part of an international tour before he stands down on June 27.Mr Blair can point to Libya’s decision in 2003 to destroy its weapons arsenal voluntarily as a rare achievement in a foreign policy otherwise overshadowed by the war in Iraq.Col Gadaffi has complained that his country has yet to see the benefits of disarmament. But with large oil and gas reserves, and a more open investment policy than most Opec members, Libya has become highly desirable for foreign companies.Libya’s Sirte Basin is the largest oilfield in Africa, holding 22 per cent of the continent’s 300bn barrels of reserves. But foreign companies operating in the country are finding high taxes and royalties mean profit margins are lower than originally expected.
609;COP;Conocophillips;2007-05-27T17:02:50Z;Lukoil to gain sway with Gazprom venture;;The creation of a joint venture between Lukoil and Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of state gas monopoly Gazprom, is set to help privately-owned Lukoil win access to large oil projects at a time when it risked being sidelined.Lukoil signed off on the creation of the joint venture with Gazprom Neft on Friday that will see them co-operate on new projects at home and abroad.The deal will give Gaz-prom Neft a 51 per cent stake and Lukoil 49 per cent, while ConocoPhillips, which currently holds a 20 per cent stake in Lukoil, will be excluded from the venture.The agreement comes as the state increases its sway over the energy sector, limiting Lukoil’s room for growth, and as both Lukoil and Gazprom Neft face increasing competition from state-controlled Rosneft.Rosneft this month overtook Lukoil as Russia’s number one oil producer after it snapped up the remains of Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s Yukos oil empire in a series of bankruptcy auctions the state-run firm dominated.Valery Nesterov, energy analyst at Troika Dialog, said that, without teaming up with Gazprom Neft, Lukoil risked being further outstripped by Rosneft. New laws on developing strategic new fields will limit access to companies that are majority Russian-owned, he said.Even though the company is totally controlled by its Russian management, which holds 28 per cent of Lukoil’s shares, the combined amount held by foreign investors in the company could exceed 50 per cent, Mr Nesterov said.“It also faces the strengthening growth of Rosneft and ahead is a battle for the major new oilfields that remain undistributed in Timan Pechora,” Mr Nesterov added, referring to the oil-rich province in northern Russia that is up for grabs.Gazprom Neft, Rosneft’s state-run rival, has also been left by the wayside by Rosneft’s recent surge. Gazprom did not take part in any of the Yukos auction, mainly, bankers say, because it feared the legal risks of doing so. Yukos’s main shareholder GML has threatened a “lifetime of litigation” for any participant in the break-up of Yukos, which has been smashed by more than $33bn in back taxes. In teaming up with Lukoil, Gazprom Neft could also win vital expertise in helping boost its oil venture, analysts said. Since Gazprom created the oil arm in 2005 via its $13bn acquisition of Roman Abramovich’s Sibneft, the oil venture has been flagging..
610;COP;Conocophillips;2007-05-08T13:29:36Z;BP appoints safety chief;;"BP on Tuesday appointed an independent expert to monitor progress at the company’s five refineries in the US in the light of a damning report earlier in the year on the group’s safety culture.The Baker panel recommended earlier this year that the energy group should make the appointment following the fatal explosion at the Texas City refinery in 2005. The panel, chaired by former US secretary of state James Baker, was appointed following a recommendation by the federal Chemical Safety Board.The appointee to the panel is L Duane Wilson, a retired vice-president for refining, marketing, supply and transportation at Conoco Phillips who was one of the members of an 11-man team that reviewed BP’s safety record. His tenure began on May 1 and he will report to the chairman of BP’s board level safety committee.There were 10 recommendations in the report published in January by the panel headed by former US secretary of state James Baker. BP undertook to implement them all.The central argument of the report was that ”BP has not provided effective process safety leadership and has not adequately established process safety as a core value across all its five US refineries”.That manifested itself in numerous ways: safety audits repeatedly uncovering problems that were not put right; lack of discipline and compliance with procedures; senior management that either did not get or did not respond effectively to detailed refinery-level safety information; and many others.The corporate culture was also blamed and BP was warned more spending would be needed on safety and more investment in the refineries.Mr Wilson’s appointment came as BP was facing fresh pressure in the UK over its safety record in its North Sea operations.BP maintained safety was a top priority in its operations in the North Sea, after press reports that the company had received a high number of “improvement notices” from the Health and Safety Executive. The Schiehallion floating production unit alone has received seven such notices, six after a scheduled inspection late last year and one since.Multiple notices are served on installations from time to time although six is certainly a high number and an overview report by HSE inspectors suggested BP was not keeping safety risks at the lowest level reasonably practicable.However, the inspectors did not issue prohibition notices, which would order an activity to cease until a problem is rectified, but rather agreed with BP dates by which improvements would be made.BP said four of the seven notices regarding Schiehallion had been closed out. The others still have time to run. In total 11 of 14 HSE notices regarding BP in the North Sea have been complied with on time, so far, he said."
611;COP;Conocophillips;2007-05-01T02:12:52Z;Chávez poses dilemma for oil companies;;"Venezuela’s military might will be on full display on Tuesday as Hugo Chávez, the country’s president and a former paratrooper, celebrates winning back Venezuela’s natural resources in the oil-rich Orinoco for the people.”Venezuela’s privatisation of oil has come to an end,” Mr Chávez said recently, promising to hoist the national flag over installations in the area that boasts the largest heavy oil deposits in the world.But in spite of the bombast, this “nationalisation” is in fact the start of a renegotiation of contractual terms that will more than likely leave PdVSA with a majority stake.The international oil companies – ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total, BP and Statoil – are being faced with several key issues: whether they will retain a sufficient stake to make staying worthwhile; how they are to be compensated for their reduced share; and whether they have a hope of exploiting reserves technically owned by Venezuela.The market value of the companies’ assets in the Orinoco Belt is about $15bn (€11bn, £7.5bn) meaning $4bn-$5bn is at stake, although analysts say compensation is likely to be less given Venezuela’s threat to pay only book value.ConocoPhillips of the US has the largest exposure to Venezuela and is the only company yet to sign up to the negotiations. It has been sending mixed signals, with Jim Mulva, chief executive, having said the company acknowledged that Pdvsa would take day-to-day control come May 1.When Total and Eni, the European groups, took a similar stand over different oilfields last year, Total ended up reaching an agreement with Pdvsa and Eni took the issue to international arbitration in New York.Negotiations over Orinoco will continue for several months after May 1. Mr Chávez wants control of at least 60 per cent of the projects – a vastly different proposition for the oil majors, who carved out attractive fiscal arrangements during the 1990s, when oil prices were low and Venezuela was desperate to attract investment.”The government was right to change the terms, but it needs to be careful those changes do not lead to a complete loss of interest from the companies to make further investments,” said Roger Tissot, an analyst at PFC Energy.Analysts question PdVSA’s own ability to shoulder the industry’s investment burden alone.They say its funds have been directed towards political goals at the expense of exploration and development investment. Spending on social programmes almost doubled in 2006 to $13.3bn, while heavily subsidised domestic oil consumption costs around $9bn a year. PdVSA also sells cheap oil to political allies in the region, such as Cuba, and is financing the nationalisation of telecommunications and electricity companies.A smooth transition of the Orinoco projects is critical. “If the organisational structure is changed, there is a risk that production could fall or that its regularity or reliability could be affected,” said Enrique Sira, a Caracas-based analyst for Cambridge Energy Research Associates.Some companies may leave altogether, but are expected to do their utmost to stay. In spite of the hurdles, the Orinoco Belt is one of the few remaining oilfields with great potential for development that is not already wholly in the hands of national oil companies.■ Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez said on Monday he wanted the Opec nation to withdraw from the Washington-based international multilateral lending organisations, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, reports Reuters.Mr Chavez says the organisations are to blame for continued poverty throughout Latin America and he plans to create an alternative that would be a lending bank run by nations in the region.Leaving the IMF and the World Bank would sever ties between the fifth largest oil supplier to the United States and the world’s leading lenders to emerging nations."
612;COP;Conocophillips;2007-04-30T00:56:35Z;April 30: May Day moves in Venezuela;;"President Hugo Chávez on Tuesday will tighten state control of Venezuela’s oil industry by sending soldiers and maybe one or two of the air force’s new Russian-built fighter aircraft into the heavy oil fields of the Orinoco. He will also, no doubt, honour the occasion with a speech celebrating the forward march of 21st century socialism.But bombast and rhetoric apart, little of real significance is likely to happen. The shape of the nationalisation has been known for some time. PDVSA, the state-owned company, will convert its minority stakes into a 60 per cent share of the new joint ventures. Beyond that complex negotiations over the terms and conditions will carry on ahead of an official deadline of June 26.For now, the international oil companies affected – ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total, BP and Statoil – are doing their utmost to gain ”fair” compensation, although ConocoPhilips has already signaled its dissatisfaction with how talks are going by not signing the memorandum of understanding last week to cede majority control to the state.Rafael Ramirez, the Venezuelan oil minister, has said that only the book value of investments rather than the market value will be recognised.The net present value of the assets of the international companies in the projects is around $15bn (based on a long-term price of $40 a barrel), of which the increased state share is likely to be worth around $4-5bn. But no one is expecting the companies to get anything like that much in return.…and in BoliviaMeanwhile, Bolivia’s President Evo Morales is likely to celebrate May Day – and the first anniversary of gas nationalisation – by tightening state control over the telecommunications sector. He should think harder before doing so.The gas nationalisation – a policy that caught international attention last year – has hardly been a resounding success. In the year since it was announced, Mr Morales has sacked one hydrocarbons minister and a head of YPFB, the state energy company. Even months after contracts were renegotiated with private companies, their implementation was held up in Congress after the discovery of massive irregularities. La Paz is still wrangling with Petrobras over the future of the Brazilian company’s two refineries in Bolivia.But Mr Morales will face even greater difficulties with his new target. For a start, it will not – unlike the gas policy – be a particularly popular step. Then there is the fact that Telecom Italia, which has a controlling stake in Entel, the dominant telecoms company in Bolivia, has vowed to protect its investment, after the government hinted it might not pay compensation. A fight – and the spectre once again of international legal action – is in the offing.Tough times for UribeThese are increasingly uncomfortable times for Colombia’s President Álvaro Uribe, who next week will spend three days in Washington trying to persuade legislators to endorse fresh anti-drugs aid under the seven year old ‘Plan Colombia’, as well as approve the US-Colombia free trade deal agreed by both governments last year.In Colombia Mr Uribe’s conservative government has been badly embarrassed by a domestic political scandal that has implicated some of its supporters – including a brother and cousin of Mr Uribe - with right-wing paramilitary groups responsible for human rights abuses. In the US, there is no question that the controversy has provided ammunition for Mr Uribe’s detractors but such is the weight of US public opinion on the drugs issue that even the Colombian president’s fiercest critics are unlikely to risk voting against ‘Plan Colombia’.Instead, they will almost certainly block the free trade deal. The reality is that the so-called para-politics scandal will make the FTA an even harder sell for the Colombian leader than it would otherwise be. Many Democratic congressmen, especially those elected for the first time last year, know voters don’t like free deals very much and will seize on any excuse to turn down the Colombian president down.This is a pity. The free trade agreement may not be ideal from a Colombian perspective but it is still the best way for the US to help foster development, as well as underlining its political support for its firmest regional ally. Critics, however, ought to take a much closer look at ‘Plan Colombia’. Although the plan has succeeded in reducing the amount of land sown to coca, the raw material for cocaine, there is no sign that that this is making the drug any more expensive on the streets of US cities. Indeed, according to a letter from the Office for National Drug Control to US senator Charles Grassley – details of which last week were made available Washington Office on Latin America, cocaine is becoming purer and last year continued to fall in price. Congressional committees are looking at the way the money is spent. If they were to recommend that less money is spent on fumigation and more on sustainable alternative development they would be taking a step in the right direction.Piping out the alcoholBrazil is widely talked of as the green Saudi Arabia of the future its hectares upon untold hectares of sugarcane providing the fuel for coming generations of planet-friendly cars. If such predictions are to come true, one big barrier to be overcome is the lack of transport infrastructure that puts such a dent in the competitiveness of Brazilian producers and manufacturers right across the economy.Like most Brazilian commodity exports, alcohol begins its journey to world markets by lorry along bumpy and often unpaved roads. Now two alcohol pipelines are in the works that would speed up the whole business. Both stretch more than a thousand kilometres from the new agricultural frontier of Brazil’s centre-west in Mato Grosso and Goiás to ports in the south-east. One is being planned by a consortium of sugar producers and shippers; another joins the private sector with Petrobras, Brazil’s government-controlled oil group, and Mitsui, a Japanese trader.Both face the kind of logistical and organisational hurdles that have stymied such projects in the past – although the Petrobras scheme has the advantage of running alongside an existing pipeline, thereby cutting through environmental and planning red tape. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is expected to sign a ”protocol of intentions” to set the project rolling on Thursday. From that to an operating pipeline, however, is a long way. For one thing, the Petrobras project will only go ahead if Japan, its main customer, decides to mandate the use of alcohol as a gasoline additive. Other hurdles, such as a shortage of berths at Brazil’s ports, also stand in the way.Correa’s revengeAs some of his political enemies start to flee to self-imposed exile in neighbouring countries, Rafael Correa looks to be strengthening his position as Ecuador’s president. As such, he clearly feels he has the time has come to settle old scores. Chief among them was his decision last week to expel the World Bank’s representative in Quito in retaliation for the Bank’s refusal to disburse a pre-agreed $100m loan during the time Correa was finance minister in 2005.The move will be cheered by the president’s supporters. But it amounts to nothing more than gesture politics. Despite the high-profile hostility towards a multilateral lender Mr Correa is not proposing to sever ties with the Bank – to which Ecuador owes some $748m. Moreover, the decisiveness of the expulsion move contrasts sharply with the government’s continuing inability to come up with its long-promised debt-restructuring plan. Now he is president, Correa would do well to deal with both domestic and international opponents in a more professional and statesmanlike way.Compiled by Hal Weitzman, Benedict Mander and Jonathan Wheatley"
613;COP;Conocophillips;2007-04-26T17:12:09Z;ExxonMobil profits outperform rivals;;ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest energy company, has again outperformed its leading rivals with a 10 per cent increase in net income for the first quarter, in spite of a fall in oil and gas prices and a steep decline in European gas sales.Net income was $9.28bn for the three-month period, up from $8.4bn in the equivalent period of last year, thanks largely to higher margins in the downstream businesses.BP kicked off the oil majors’ reporting season on Tuesday with a 17 per cent decline in first quarter net income. ConocoPhillips on Wednesday reported an 8 per cent increase, helped by the acquisition of Burlington Resources, but its net income per share was down 9 per cent.Exxon’s earnings per share were up 18 per cent at $1.62 for the quarter, ahead of analysts’ forecasts.A 23 per cent reduction in gas output caused by the relatively warm weather in Europe, which is Exxon’s biggest region for gas production, cut total production to an average of 4.436m barrels of oil equivalent a day, down 2.7 per cent from the first quarter of 2006.However, margin improvements in refining and chemicals helped drive a 50 per cent increase in downstream earnings to $1.91bn, and a 30 per cent increase in chemicals earnings to $1.24bn.Exxon also returned $8.8bn to shareholders in the quarter, $1.8bn in dividends and $7bn in share buybacks, or 26 per cent more than in the first quarter of 2006.
614;COP;Conocophillips;2007-04-25T21:26:01Z;Dow sets new mark on strong earnings;;Wall Street cheered a string of better-than-expected earnings and a rise in reported capital spending on Wednesday, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average through the 13,000 threshold for the first time.The bullish mood in stocks largely reflected upbeat corporate earnings and guidance in recent weeks.The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent higher at 1,495.42 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9 per cent at 2,547.89.Although they are at fresh six-and-a-half-year highs, the S&P and the Nasdaq are below the record levels set in March 2000, namely 1,527.46 and 5,048.62, respectively.In contrast, the Dow’s 30 large-cap stocks set a new record close of 13,089.89, a gain of 1.05 per cent and reached a high of 13,107.45 earlier in the day. The Dow Transportation and Utilities Averages also set record highs of 5,254.90 and 531.27, respectively.“The Dow tends to be tilted towards value stocks and is energy- and resource-heavy, and these areas have been doing well lately,” said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services.He said the weaker dollar also provided a boost to US companies geared towards exporting or competing with imports.Of the 19 Dow companies that have so far reported first-quarter results, 13 have exceeded forecast earnings.Leading the Dow higher was Alcoa, up 5.3 per cent at $35.76 after it said it would explore the sale of its packaging and consumer businesses. Exxon Mobil gained 1.7 per cent to $79.92 amid higher oil prices and ahead of earnings due on Thursday.IBM built on its gains from Tuesday and rose 3 per cent to $101.46. The stock has risen 7.3 per cent this week, buoyed by a higher dividend and plans for $15bn in stock buy-backs.Another Dow stock, Boeing, recouped early losses and gained 1.1 per cent to $94.69 after first-quarter earnings rose 27 per cent compared with a year earlier.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the recent rise in the Dow reflected retirement accounts being opened since the tax year closed on April 15 and the belief among investors that a falling dollar would boost earnings for multinational companies.“Money is jumping into large-cap stocks as they are easy to buy and that tells me the current run is getting tired and is close to ending,” he said.The Dow’s return of 5 per cent so far this year remains adrift of the S&P’s gain of 5.4 per cent. But both benchmarks lag the 10.4 per cent rise in the S&P 400 index of medium-sized companies.The mid-cap index set a new record high of 889.52 on Wednesday and analysts said these companies are in a “sweet spot”.Some benefit from the weaker dollar boosting foreign earnings while, in general, the sector provides suitable buy-out candidates for private equity funds.“Investors are gravitating towards mid-caps’ ongoing profit momentum,” said Alec Young, equity strategist for S&P’s Equity Research.He expected that S&P 400 earnings would rise 13 per cent this year, against a 7 per cent increase for the S&P 500.The explosive rally in Amazon shares on Wednesday was its largest one-day rise since November 2001. Analysts said the surge was no surprise after its strong earnings and also reflected the limited supply of available shares. Some 70 per cent of Amazon’s stock is held by a handful of investors and short interest in the company was around 12 per cent according to Nasdaq data.Amazon also benefited from brokerage upgrades. Mark Mahaney, analyst at Citigroup upgraded Amazon to a ‘Hold’ from a ‘Sell’ and said “a key part of our ‘Sell’ thesis no longer holds” namely that the company “had seen the likely end of margin boosts from third party sales…and we were wrong.”As earnings season continued, PepsiCo said first-quarter profit rose 16 per cent and the company affirmed its guidance for this year. Its stock rose 0.9 per cent to $66.98.ConocoPhillips said its first-quarter profit rose 7.7 per cent, with income from asset sales offsetting lower commodity prices and higher operating costs. The oil group’s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $70.82.Apple, the computer maker, rose 2.3 per cent to $95.35, ahead of earnings due out after the closing bell. Apple said fiscal second quarter profits jumped 88 per cent and beat estimates, amid strong sales of its iPod music players and Macintosh computers. In after-hours trade, shares had risen 7.7 per cent to $102.69.Shares in Corning rose 5.3 per cent to $24.98 after its first-quarter profit jumped 27 per cent.Sun Microsystems tumbled 11.3 per cent to $5.27 after its sales growth missed expectations, in spite of the computer server maker swinging to a small profit in the fiscal third quarter ending April 1.Shares in Eastman Kodak rose 9.2 per cent to $26.23.
615;COP;Conocophillips;2007-04-16T15:26:14Z;Tyson and Conoco in biodiesel venture;;Tyson, the world’s largest protein producer, announced plans on Monday to produce biodiesel from animal fats in partnership with ConocoPhillips at a time of mounting concern over the impact of ethanol demand on food prices.Dick Bond, Tyson’s president and chief executive, has been a leading advocate of the need for policymakers to recognise the knock-on effects of diverting corn from animal feed to produce ethanol, warning it could lead to a ripple effect of higher global food prices.Mr Bond said the joint venture with Conoco was a “win-win”, because it diversified renewable fuel sources away from corn towards animal fats. Tyson is the largest beef producer in the US, and the second-largest producer of pork and poultry.In January, Mr Bond called on Washington to recognise the competing claims of the food and energy sectors when drawing up a proposed farm bill. ”If left unaddressed, the bigger long-term issue will be the availability of US and global grain for protein and other foods,” he warned.Mr Bond said yesterday that his views had not changed, arguing that the animal fat feedstock was used for pet food and cosmetics, rather than human consumption.“Today, fat is not a major component of food, corn is,” Mr Bond told the Financial Times. “[But] we need to make sure we do not put too much corn in the fuel side.”He said there should not be a “major“ impact on food prices, though suggested a rise in demand for animal fats could make it willing to pay “a little” more for hogs and chickens.Tyson plans to use half of the animal fat derived from its operations, with annual production expected to expand over 18 months to 175m gallons, helped by a $1 a gallon tax credit. Biodiesel remains less popular in the US than in Europe, with current production of 864m gallons a year, according to the National Biodiesel Board, just 15 per cent of the present output of ethanol.The two companies said the move would increase energy security, mirroring the US administration’s position that increased renewable fuel production – boosted by tax credits and subsidies – will reduce the reliance on imports of fossil fuels.However, other policy experts maintain the current subsidy system is distorting market prices, while the surge in demand for corn-derived ethanol threatens to increase global hunger.“The danger is that we are moving to a world of food insecurity,” said Lester Brown, head of the Washington-based Earth Policy Institute. Mr Brown has been a long-time proponent of the need for markets to price in the impact of climate change and energy efficiency, and warned that rising global food prices threaten to accelerate the destabilisation of weak political regimes.Conoco, like other oil and gas groups, has been investing in renewable fuel production and technology, helped in part by the grants and subsidies on offer. However, some critics point to the lukewarm response of the industry in marketing renewables, particularly the lukewarm response to E85, a fuel with a large ethanol content.While the pro-ethanol and renewable fuel lobby is now well organised in the US ahead of a new farm bill expected this year, consumer groups are only starting to highlight rising food prices as a potential knock-on effect.Tyson’s move also highlights splits within the agricultural community. Big ethanol producers such as Archer Daniels Midland also insist there is no conflict because better technology will boost corn yields to meet the demand for animal feed and ethanol. However, Cargill – which is also expanding its ethanol production – has maintained that use of corn has to be prioritised in terms of “food, feed and fuel – in that order” – and called for a wider national debate.Tyson said production of its renewable diesel is expected to start later this year, and could add between 4 cents and 16 cents a share to annual earnings, depending on diesel and animal fat prices.
616;COP;Conocophillips;2007-03-28T20:32:44Z;Wall St falls after Bernanke testimony;;Wall Street stocks fell for the third successive day on Wednesday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that inflation remained “uncomfortably high”.The S&P 500 dropped by as much as 1 per cent as Ben Bernanke began his testimony to Congress, although the benchmark index later recovered some of its losses.Investors interpreted Mr Bernanke’s remarks as suggesting that the Fed was less likely to cut interest rates than some bulls had hoped.The testimony came after a smaller-than-expected rise in durable goods orders and rising oil prices weighed on sentiment in early trade.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, highlighted remarks by Mr Bernanke to the effect that higher wages would either need to be absorbed by better productivity or falling profit margins.“As productivity is coming down, that puts pressure on profit margins or prices,” he said. “Neither of those possibilities is good for the market and that is why stocks accelerated to the downside.”The S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent lower at 1,416.98.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8 per cent to 12,295.71. The technology-led Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,417.10.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility nicknamed Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped 11.6 per cent to 15.04.The homebuilders’ sector was once again under pressure. Shares in Beazer Homes plunged 8.4 per cent to $28.77 after reports that its mortgage lending was under investigation by federal authorities, including the FBI.Beazer said it was co-operating with authorities but said no allegations of wrongdoing had been made.The investigation hastened a sell-off in homebuilders’ stocks, sparked by signs of weakness in sales and prices of newly built homes through the important spring selling season. DR Hortonwas 1.9 per cent down at $22.05. Pulte Homes fell 2.9 per cent to $26.02.Concerns about mortgage lending and interest rates also prompted selling of financial groups. Mortgage lender Countrywide was 2.6 per cent lower at $33.81. Lehman Brothers, which is active in the mortgage market, fell 2.3 per cent to $70.08.Fears of a prolonged slump in the housing market has dragged down cyclical stocks – such as retailers, transport and materials groups – that are most sensitive to the economy. Alcoa, the aluminium group, fell 1.4 per cent to $33.67 while General Motors was 2.9 per cent down at $31.24.Wal-Mart slipped 1.6 per cent to $46.72 after the retailer’s chief executive said that 2007 would be “challenging”.Rising oil prices helped energy groups make gains with ConocoPhillips rising 0.4 per cent to $69.19.Circuit City rose 1.7 per cent to $19.20 after it said it was replacing 3,400 sales people with new staff who would work for less money.
617;COP;Conocophillips;2007-03-07T22:03:47Z;Wall Street retreats in calm trading;;Wall Street stocks flicked in and out of positive territory on Wednesday before closing lower as energy companies fell from early highs.The retreat came at the end of a calm day’s trading in which cautious investors paused for breath after a tumultuous week.Stronger oil prices gave the broad energy sector a boost but the gains were trimmed by the close. Shares in Chevron rose 1 per cent to $68.33 and ConocoPhillips closed 2 per cent stronger at $68.30.The mood was somewhat subdued by a smaller-than-expected reading of last month’s private sector jobs growth from ADP.“It is a consolidation day with no real news after a big run [on Tuesday],” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The payroll numbers were a little disappointing but the market is waiting for the more important jobs data released on Friday.”The S&P 500 Index closed 0.3 per cent down at 1,391.97.Deere & Co advanced after Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the farming equipment maker from “equal weight” to “overweight” because of rising corn prices. Its shares rose 3.5 per cent higher to $110.81.The Dow Jones Industrial Average surrendered early gains to close 0.1 per cent lower at 12,192.45. The Dow was supported by Exxon stock, which rose 1 per cent to $71.64 after a well received analyst briefing.The Vix Index, a measure of market volatility that is dubbed Wall Street’s fear gauge, eased 4.5 per cent to 15.24 in a sign that investor anxiety was stabilising.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent softer at 2,377.45, weighed down by American Eagle Outfitters. Shares in the retailer fell 2.8 per cent to $28.97 after it missed analysts’ earnings estimates.Shares in CV Therapeutics plunged after the group said a new drug had failed in trials to help sufferers of acute heart disease. The stock was down 23.6 per cent at $9.40.The troubled subprime lending sector rallied after Fremont General said that it was talking to a number of groups that were interested in buying its mortgage business. Its shares jumped 25.8 per cent to $8.53.Homebuilders stocks were pulled in opposite directions after seemingly conflicting comments about the housing market from two leading industry figures. Toll Brothers gained 1.5 per cent to $29.24 after relatively upbeat remarks from Robert Toll, its chief executive.By contrast, DR Horton stock was flat at $24.55 after Don Tomnitz, chief executive, said that business in 2007 would “suck”.Shares in Take-Two Interactive Software jumped 10 per cent to $19.36 after a group of disgruntled shareholders in the video games maker ousted management.In deal news, reports that Sam Zell, the property investor, was a strong contender to buy Tribune sent shares in the media group up 0.8 per cent to $30.46.
618;COP;Conocophillips;2007-03-07T19:34:42Z;ExxonMobil’s Venezuelan finale plays out;;ExxonMobil signalled on Wednesday that it could pull out of Venezuela if it cannot strike a deal with the government on handing over control of its oil operations in the Orinoco basin.The warning follows a decree last week from Hugo Chávez, the country’s leftwing president, ordering PDVSA, the state oil company, to take a stake of at least 60 per cent in four oil-producing joint ventures in the heavy crude Orinoco Belt, a move that would affect Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP, France’s Total and Statoil of Norway, as well as Exxon.“It will be a function of can we shift ownership to a value proposition that works for us,” Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon, told Dow Jones. “If not, everything else is moot because we won’t be staying, we’ll be leaving.”Mr Tillerson indicated that the reaction of foreign investors was critical to the future of Mr Chávez’s pursuit of “resource nationalism”.“If [International oil companies] feel they’ve retained value and stay involved, that gives a pattern for the future,” he said. “If IOCs leave, that gives another pattern.”Mr Tillerson’s comments strike a different tone from a statement Exxon issued earlier this week, in which it suggested it would co-operate fully with the takeover.Exxon said on Monday it would agree to participate in a transition committee to oversee the transfer of its control of the Cerro Negro heavy crude project to PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company. Exxon owns a 41.7 per cent stake in the venture, as does PDVSA. The remaining 16.6 per cent is owned by BP.The Orinoco facilities are the last privately controlled oil installations remaining in Venezuela. PDVSA estimates that the Orinoco is the largest hydrocarbons deposit in the world, with nearly 300bn barrels in recoverable reserves. The region produces between 500,000 and 620,000 barrels per day, about a quarter of Venezuela’s total production.Caracas has taken a hard line, warning that if the companies do not hand over control of the operations by a May 1 deadline, the government will take them over unilaterally. “If by the deadline there is no agreement, we will take direct control of all these operations,” said Rafael Ramírez, energy minister, this week.In partnership with PDVSA, the foreign investors ploughed $17bn into Venezuela to set up the Orinoco projects in the 1990s. The projects, which convert tar oil into high-value synthetic crude, are now estimated to be worth about $31bn.Total looks to be the most likely to agree to transfer operations at its Orinoco facilities after the company this week settled a year-long dispute with Caracas over the small Jusepin field, which the government seized last year.On a visit to Caracas this week, Christophe de Margerie, the French oil company’s new chief executive, and BP agreed not to sue Venezuela and accepted $250m compensation for their entire stake in the Jusepin field.Mr de Margerie suggested that the disagreements over Jusepin had been overshadowed by the company’s desire to proceed with negotiations over the future of the Sincor heavy oil project in the Orinoco.“The priority is really the Orinoco,” he said. “It needs highly skilled labour, and our number one priority is to maintain production at the existing Sincor.”Ultimately, the foreign investors with operations in the Orinoco basin are expected to agree to new terms – as did more than two dozen other inter-national companies operating under service contracts in the country’s conventional oil fields did last year. Although they must hand over control by May 1, Venezuela has given the companies until July to agree new contracts, which will then go to Congress to be approved.As Mr Tillerson’s warning hints, one serious stumbling block will be over compensation. Mr Ramírez said on Monday that PDVSA would compensate the companies in crude oil rather than cash. The industry also fears that it might be offered credits toward future investments as compensation.PDVSA used credit vouchers last year as part of its compensation to oil companies affected by its takeover of 32 mature oil fields. Caracas paid $913m in vouchers to companies that accepted minority stakes and new joint-venture structures.The concern is that although in theory the credits can be used to bid in new licensing rounds, to expand existing upstream operations or can be sold to other companies, in practice it is difficult to use them. PDVSA has promised, but not delivered, new licensing rounds where the credits could be used.
619;COP;Conocophillips;2007-02-23T18:51:07Z;Eni’s Kashagan oil field hit by delays;;"Development of the world’s most important new oil field will be delayed by a further three years and require almost double the investment initially anticipated, Eni, the Italian oil group operating the field, said on Friday.Kazakhstan’s giant Kashagan oil field will now produce its first oil at the end of 2010 and hit peak production by 2019, according to Paolo Scaroni, chief executive of Eni, Europe’s fourth largest listed international energy group.The field, discovered in 2000, remains the largest to have been discovered in more than 30 years. It is critical for global supplies; today only three of the world’s 4,000 oil fields exceed the 1.5m-barrel-a-day production Kashagan is expected to achieve by 2019.Announcement of the delay and escalating costs comes just two days after ExxonMobil, the world’s largest international energy group, scrapped its $15bn natural gas project in Qatar because of runaway expenses.Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the consultant, estimates costs of major oil and gas projects have risen 53 per cent across the industry because of tight labour and equipment supplies in the past two years.Kashagan will now need $19bn to develop to the initial stage of producing 300,000 barrels a day by early 2011. That is up from the original estimate of $10.3bn and the $14-15bn guidance given to investors at last year’s strategy review. However, the field’s peak production would be 25 per cent higher than initially thought, Mr Scaroni said.Kashagan is Eni’s flagship operation. The delay has forced the company to lower from 4 to 3 per cent its three-year production growth target, while the cost increases contributed to the 27 per cent jump in its three year capital expenditure plan to €44.6bn ($58.5bn). Partners, which include ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, of the US, Royal Dutch Shell and Total, of Europe, and Inpex of Japan, will also suffer.A third of the project’s extra cost has arisen from the need to move workers’ quarters away from deadly hydrogen sulphide hazards. The remainder covers foreign exchange, labour and equipment cost inflation and the expansion of the project. Much of the expense will be borne by Kazakhstan, unless officials decide to rewrite the contract that allows Eni and its partners to recoup their costs.Sanford Bernstein, the financial services group, earlier this week suggested Kashagan could become as serious a quagmire for Eni as Sakhalin II has become for Royal Dutch Shell. Shell last year lost its majority stake to Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, following delays and the admission that the project would cost $20bn, rather than $10bn."
620;COP;Conocophillips;2007-02-13T21:57:23Z;Verizon’s Venezuela deal buoys investors;;"Venezuela’s nationalisation of four oil production units run by several multinationals as part of President Hugo Chávez’s “21st century socialist” revolution could turn out to be market-friendly acquisitions.Optimism was growing on Tuesday among foreign investors after an unexpectedly trouble-free and swift deal for the government to buy US-based Verizon Communications’ stake in Venezuela’s largest privately held telecoms company.Government officials said Verizon would sell its 28.5 per cent shareholding
in Compañía Nacional Anónima Teléfonos de Venezuela, or Cantv, to the state for $572m (€440m, £295m), a price that reflected fair value for the assets.At an equivalent of $17.85 for each Cantv American Depositary Receipt, the price is about 15 per cent less than Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim had, until only last month, offered to pay Verizon for the stake.But the price is much higher than investors had feared in the wake of Mr Chávez’s sweeping nationalisation announcements in January, after which Cantv’s ADRs plunged as low as $11. Yesterday they rose more than 7 per cent.Spooked by Mr Chávez’s “anti-capitalist” rhetoric, investors had been concerned over Venezuela’s willingness to compensate shareholders, if not its cash-rich government’s capacity to pay.Yet experts remained cautious over the fate of the Orinoco Belt oil projects, in which US companies ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, and European groups BP, Statoil and Total have stakes.Gersan Zurita, an analyst at Fitch Ratings in New York, said that although the government had recently issued more statements referring to compensation, how the impending oil sector takeover will proceed was still anyone’s guess.“Based on inconsistent commentary from government officials, it is as likely that they will expropriate without compensation as it is that they will reach an agreement acceptable to the project owners and lenders,” he said. “We are watching this daily and trying to guess the next chess move.”While Venezuela has deemed telephony and electricity supply as “strategic” sectors earmarked for government control, Mr Zurita added that the oil sector was a far more fundamental and ideological target for Mr Chávez’s “revolution”.Mr Chávez has set May 1 as a deadline for the four “strategic association” units in the Orinoco River Belt, which produce about 600,000 barrels per day of oil, or a quarter of national output, to become majority state-controlled.Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, holds stakes in the units varying between 30 and 49 per cent but Mr Chávez has said this will rise to at least 60 per cent.Analysts have also warned that the partial nationalisation of the Orinoco projects is a far more complex process than the acquisition of an equity stake in Cantv. About $4bn in Orinoco project finance bonds are still outstanding, and the instruments are subject to strict ownership transfer restriction agreements.As for Cantv, critics said state control threatened to return telecommunications in Venezuela to the dark ages when, before its privatisation in 1991, citizens could wait eight years to have a line installed and days for a dial tone.“Privatisation was a great leap forward in modernising Venezuela,” said Gerver Torres, an economist who oversaw Cantv’s privatisation. “Today no one nationalises companies for ideological reasons, except Venezuela.”■Venezuela signed a preliminary agreement with CMS Energy Corp yesterday to buy the US-based company’s stake in a local power company, reports AP from Caracas.PDVSA, the state-run oil company, bought the company’s 70 per cent stake in Seneca, a small power company operating in eastern Venezuela, for $105m."
621;COP;Conocophillips;2007-02-13T15:34:36Z;Investor group unveils climate blacklist;;A coalition of US institutional investors has stepped up pressure on corporate America to do more on environmental issues by accusing 10 companies of failing to address climate change and global warming.The move by Ceres, a group of state pension funds, environmental and religious groups with more than $200bn in assets, highlights a rise in investor and political demands on business to do more to deal with environmental problems.The publication of the blacklist – which names the oil group ExxonMobil, financial services group Wells Fargo and utility TXU – coincided with the filing of shareholder motions at more than 35 companies demanding action on climate change. The list also includes the oil group ConocoPhillips, retailer Bed Bath & Beyond and insurer ACE.The issue will be a key battleground in the upcoming season of shareholder meetings after investors filed a record 42 motions urging actions ranging from reduction in greenhouse gases to better disclosure of energy efficiency plans.The pension funds behind the black list, which include the states of New York, North Carolina, Connecticut and Vermont, say that they cannot “vote with their feet” and sell shares in the companies because they own mostly index funds.As a result, they have to resort to “naming and shaming” and filing resolutions at shareholder meetings.ExxonMobil said on Tuesday it “recognises and is responding appropriately to the risks associated with climate change”.The 10 companies:
622;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConocoPhillips hit by fall in gas prices;;"ConocoPhillips, the third largest US oil and gas company, reported its first drop in earnings since 2002, kicking off what is expected to be a downbeat 2006 results season for the sector.The US and European majors are generally expected to report record profits for 2006 as a whole, but a decline in earnings in the last quarter of the year, because of the fall in the prices of oil and natural gas, and a squeeze on refining margins.ConocoPhillips’ net income per share was $1.91 in the fourth quarter, down 27 per cent from the equivalent period of 2005. For the year as a whole, net income was $9.66 per share, up just 1 per cent from 2005. Net income was $15.6bn for the year, up 15 per cent.“We continued to experience operational challenges in our upstream business during the quarter,"" said Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chairman and chief executive officer. Those included weather-related disruption to production, which was in the fourth quarter roughly the same as in the third quarter at 2.05m barrels of oil equivalent per day.Like the rest of the industry, ConocoPhillips has been hit by a rise in costs, driven by a shortage of drilling rigs, raw materials and skilled personnel,Analysts also estimated a rise in the company’s finding and development costs to $18 per barrel of oil equivalent, up from its five-year average of $7.14/BOE.International oil companies are also finding it difficult to find enough new reserves to replace their production.ConocoPhillips shocked many analysts earlier in the month when it indicated an organic reserve replacement ratio for 2006 of just 11 per cent.“Obviously we want 100 per cent plus,” said Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. “That, by the company’s own admission, is a weak number.”However, ConocoPhillips argued yesterday that a five-year average of 65 per cent gave a fairer view of the company’s performance, and specific decisions on reserves in the North Sea and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan had led to reserves write-downs last year.After the $37bn acquisition of Burlington Resources last year, the world’s biggest energy sector deal in the past five years, ConocoPhillips indicated it would not be making any more large acquisitions.Analysts at Citigroup have forecast that on average the US integrated oil companies will post a decline of 23 per cent in fourth quarter earnings for 2006 compared to 2005. For European companies, which are as a group less exposed to swings in the oil price, they expect a decline of 3 per cent in dollar terms."
623;COP;Conocophillips;2007-01-23T22:26:20Z;Lukoil opts for subtlety to extend reach;;"In a few weeks’ time, Lukoil, the Russian oil group, will establish a visible presence in Belgium with the acquisition of 156 petrol stations on the country’s highways.While they will account for under 10 per cent of the Belgian market, they will represent a high-profile new west European outpost for the fast-expanding company. Lukoil is buying the outlets from ConocoPhillips of the US, its strategic partner, in a deal which covers a total of 383 stations in six European Union countries - Finland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary, as well as Belgium. All will be switched from Conoco’s Jet brand to Lukoil.The acquisition is Lukoil’s latest move in a long-running campaign to carve out a presence for itself in the European Union - in a strategy which parallels the investments made by Gazprom, the Russian gas group, in downstream gas assets.However, while Gazprom has often prompted controversy through headline-making projects, Lukoil has employed a more subtle approach – and focused on countries in south east Europe where Russia encounters less political suspicion than in central and western Europe.EU concerns about dependency on Russia are generally smaller than with gas because oil is more easily transported and more freely available on world markets.
But, as with gas, it takes only a short supply break to raise political tensions, as occurred when Russia this month cut oil supplies flowing to the EU through Belarus in a row over transit charges.Some politicians, particularly in eastern Europe, worry that, as with Gazprom, Russian oil companies’ downstream investments could give the Kremlin a political lever. In Bulgaria, Milko Kovachev, a former energy minister, says: “Bulgaria is unacceptably dependent on Russian oil and gas, not just for supplies but because Russian concerns have ownership of Bulgarian energy companies.”In a string of acquisitions dating back 10 years, Lukoil has invested $3bn in downstream assets, principally in eastern Europe, including buying three refineries in Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria and acquiring 2,000 petrol stations in the region. The group says it plans to invest a further $9bn in downstream investments outside Russia in the next 10 years, mainly in Europe. Vagit Alekperov, the chief executive, said in a recent speech that, for Lukoil, “creating global downstream production chains” was “ becoming a major driver.”Unlike state-controlled Gazprom, Lukoil is a fully-privatised company that works closely with a strategic foreign shareholder – Conoco, which owns just under 20 per cent. Lukoil’s push into eastern Europe started in the late 1990s, when it bought stakes in three refineries linked to Russian pipelines – Odessa in Ukraine, Petrotel in Romania and Burgas in Bulgaria.

Lukoil sought refining capacity for its growing crude production and to block western rivals’ access to markets. The global oil market was then weak, refining margins were low and plants could be bought cheaply – especially in eastern Europe, where the western majors were not investing. Today, with oil prices high, Lukoil executives are delighted at their foresight. “A decade later, it’s a different universe,” says Gennady Krasovsky, deputy head of strategic analysis and investment.

The group has invested heavily – about half the $3bn total – in modernising and expanding its refineries. Last year, 19 per cent of Lukoil crude was refined in eastern Europe, outside Russia.

Meanwhile, the group has expanded in retail, buying petrol stations from the Baltic to the Black Sea. It has substantial networks in Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic states and Serbia. It even has a small chain in Poland, where political sensitivity to Russian investors is especially high.

Not everything has gone Lukoil’s way. An attempt to buy control of the Maziekiu refinery in Lithuania last year came to nothing when Vilnius decided to keep the plant out of Russian hands and sell to Poland’s PKN Orlen. Warsaw has repeatedly plans to invest in Poland’s refining capacity.Lukoil has not limited its ambitions to eastern Europe. In 2005, it paid $160m for two Finnish marketing and distribution companies – Lukoil’s first investment directly in the EU. At about the same time, it unsuccessfully tried to buy a 50 per cent stake in Germany’s Ruhr Oel, which controls four refineries. Last year, it agreed with Petrol, Slovenia’s main oil products distributor, for a joint venture that would operate in Italy as well as the western Balkans.

Now, Lukoil is hoping to complete the petrol station deal with Conoco and would also like to buy Conoco’s 16 per cent stake in Ceska Rafinerska, the Czech refiner, although the Czech group Unipetrol, which has a controlling interest, has rights of first refusal.

Lukoil is committed to further downstream investments in Europe and in North America where it bought a chain of petrol stations from Getty Oil in a widely-publicised deal in 2000. The group plans to increase refining capacity by 100m tonnes annually - or 70 per cent - in 10 years, with a big emphasis on further investments in the EU.

However, competition for downstream assets is growing, particularly from Rosneft, the state-controlled Russian oil company, and Gazprom which is keen to expand in oil as well as gas. The Kremlin this month decided to restrict future offshore projects to just Gazprom and Rosneft, excluding Lukoil and other non-state Russian companies as well as foreign groups. For Lukoil, competing with Rosneft and Gazprom, even for foreign assets could be politically awkward.Additional reporting by Jan Cienski in Warsaw, Robert Anderson in Prague, Kester Eddy in Budapest, Roman Olearchyk in Ukraine, Neil Macdonald in Belgrade and Kerin Hope in Athens."

He believes large pharmaceutical companies will benefit most from a further fall in oil.At the close yesterday, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent firmer at 1,430.73, its highest level since 2000, and a gain of 1.5 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 12,556.08, a new record close and gained 1.3 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.7 per cent to 2,502.82, a rise of 2.8 per cent this week.Apple set a record high of $97.80 after unveiling its new iPhone. That mood was clipped when Cisco said it had taken legal action over Apple’s use of the iPhone name and by reports of Federal scrutiny over backdated stock options given to Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive officer. Shares in Apple were 11.3 per cent higher for the week at $94.62.Marvell Technology, a chipmaker used by Apple for the iPhone, rose 5 per cent to $20.39.Other notable technology shares on the up this week included Yahoo, with a gain of 6.2 per cent to $29.45, and Microsoft, up 5.3 per cent at $31.21, its highest level since 2002.But it was not all good news for technology stocks as Advanced Micro Devices said lower product chip prices would hurt fourth quarter earnings and revenue. Shares in AMD plunged yesterday and were 7.4 per cent lower for the week at $18.26.Citigroup downgraded AMD and, although the news briefly hurt the Philadelphia semiconductor index, it was 2.9 per cent higher for the week.Shares in Intel, AMD’s rival, reversed early weakness yesterday and were up 4.9 per cent over the week at $22.13.Intel has gained 9 per cent since the start of the year and analysts believe the company has taken market share from AMD.“Intel has a reinvigorated product line that third party evaluations indicate have superior performance to AMD’s product line,” noted Citigroup.As tech hummed, oil stocks slid, led by a 5.3 per cent fall to $63.83 in ConocoPhillips. Exxon Mobil fell 0.8 per cent to $72.66, and is the weakest stock in the Dow this year with a loss of 5.3 per cent.The exchange-traded fund that tracks the energy sector of the S&P under the ticker symbol XLE fell 1 per cent to $55.44 this week and is down 11 per cent from the record high of $62.13 set in mid-December.Airline stocks were boosted by the lower oil prices, talk of further consolidation and the prospect of better earnings.

The energy group was the laggard and ended 1.7 per cent lower, leaving it down 7.5 per cent for the year.The recent slide in oil prices is potentially good news for consumer spending and a boon for broad stock prices say analysts. But as the fourth-quarter earnings season got under way, investors kept the broad averages trading inside narrow ranges.“The one overwhelming constant since 2003 among investors has been perpetual worry and a lack of confidence,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “Earnings are a concern. But $50 oil is much better for the the vast majority of companies than $80 oil.”Technology shares led the market higher after the broad averages were lower in the morning.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,459.33, helped by gains in semiconductor stocks and Apple, up 4.8 per cent to $97.Apple set a new all-time high of $97.80 in early trade as it built on the surge which followed its unveiling on Tuesday of its new iPhone product.

buyers.Stronger-than-expected job creation in December sent stocks lower on Friday and tipped them into negative territory for the week. Equity investors began the year optimistic that a Federal Reserve rate cut before June would offset slower earnings growth.“A rate cut is looking less likely in the first half of this year,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment adviser at Deutsche Bank. “The most important factor for the equity market this year will be evidence of inflation moderating and trending lower as it will give the Fed the flexibility to cut rates should the economy slow further.”The S&P 500 settled down 0.6 per cent at 1,409.71 on Friday, a fall of 0.6 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent lower at 2,434.25, but was 0.8 per cent higher for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 0.7 per cent to 12,398.01, a fall of 0.5 per cent this week, and was down from a new record high of 12,580.35 on Wednesday.Although a $6 plunge in the price of oil this week should help allay fears of inflation, energy stocks were hit hard and the S&P 500 energy index slid 4.8 per cent for the week. But the S&P information technology sector was 1.5 per cent firmer.Among technology stocks that fared well was BMC Software, rising 8.4 per cent to $34.92, while Yahoo, which declined 35 per cent last year, rose 8.6 per cent to $27.74. Another laggard from 2006 was Intel, but the stock rose 4.2 per cent to $21.10 this week and was the best stock in the Dow.Cisco shares rallied 4.2 per cent to $28.47 after the company announced that it had bought e-mail security company IronPort Systems for $830m.“Technology has a higher weighting in our portfolios than was the case a year ago,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at RiverSource Investments.He said large software companies were also attractive “as they are very good cashflow generators and trade at cheap multiples”.Not all tech shares rose. Motorola plunged 7.9 per cent to $18.94 for the week after the mobile phone maker said lower sales would reduce fourth quarter earnings below estimates.AT&T led the Dow lower this week, falling 5 per cent to $33.96.

A 2.9 per cent increase in November has extended gains in the Russell 2000 index of small capitalised stocks to 15.7 per cent for the year.The Dow lagged behind last month, rising just 1.2 per cent, for a rise of 13.8 per cent this year.

629;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

632;COP;Conocophillips;2006-10-10T08:12:42Z;Gazprom refuses help with Shtokman;;Gazprom said on Monday it would develop Russia’s massive Shtokman natural gas field alone – and switch eventual output from the US to Europe – dashing the hopes of foreign companies vying for stakes in the $20bn project.Alexei Miller, chief executive, told Russian television the monopoly had decided against offering 49 per cent of Shtokman to five short-listed international groups because they had been unable to offer suitable assets in exchange. The shortlist included Chevron and ConocoPhillips of the US, Norway’s Statoil and Norsk Hydro, and France’s Total.Mr Miller said Gazprom was changing the priority of Shtokman – which has reserves bigger than those of the UK and Norway combined – from shipping liquefied natural gas to the US to supplying Europe via pipelines. The field would now feed a pipeline under construction across the Baltic Sea floor from Russia to Germany.“We have taken the decision that the development…will proceed without the participation of foreign companies – 100 per cent of the reserves will belong to Gazprom,” he said.The announcement highlights the Kremlin’s determination that Russian companies should take the lead in developing the country’s oil and gas. It follows pressure on the Royal Dutch Shell-led Sakhalin-2 project, and signs that state-controlled Gazprom wants to buy out private Russian shareholders of TNK-BP, the Anglo-Russian joint venture.The news is a particular setback for the US, which expected to have two participating companies and to be the main recipient of natural gas.“This is a fairly deliberate statement of intent that Russia is going to orientate its economic co-operation as well as political co-operation towards Europe, not the US,” said Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Alfa Bank in Moscow.He warned that the move might delay Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. Russian and US negotiators were to meet in Geneva this week to try to eliminate the remaining obstacles to Moscow’s WTO bid.Gazprom was preparing to announce its Shtokman partners this year but appeared to back off after the participation of US companies became entangled with talks over Russia’s WTO entry.Short-listed foreign groups said they had not been notified of Gazprom’s decision and declined to comment.Oil executives and analysts speculated that Gazprom might reconsider, questioning whether it could tackle the challenging project in the Barents Sea with the help only of foreign construction and service companies.

Wal-Mart sank 2.3 per cent to $48.41 and supermarket chain Safeway dipped 4.7 per cent to $28.18. Department store Dillard’s tumbled
7.4 per cent to $31.15 after it disappointed investors with flat same-store sales growth in September.News that Wal-Mart would expand its programme of selling low cost generic drugs sent drugstore Walgreens down 3.3 per cent to $43.39 and CVS down 3.8 per cent to $30.93.At the close, the Dow was up 0.1 per cent, or 16.08 points, at 11,866.69 – its third consecutive record close.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 3.00 points, at a new five-and-a-half-year high of 1,353.22, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent, or 15.39 points, at 2,306.34.Steelmakers were lifted by acquisition news after India’s Tata said it was considering making a bid for Anglo-Dutch steel group Corus.

634;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Energy groups to link in Canadian oil sands;;EnCana, the Canadian energy company, and ConocoPhillips, the US oil major, on Thursday struck a deal to invest $10.7bn in a new joint venture formed to ratchet up the exploitation of Canada’s vast oil sands.The deal is the result of EnCana’s year-long search for a partner to provide it with the refining capacity it needs to turn its heavy oil into gasoline and other products for the US market.Canada’s oil sands, mainly located in the western province of Alberta, have experienced a boom amid rising oil prices in recent years, as the high cost of extracting the heavy oil finally became palatable.This drove a number of international oil groups to study ways to tap the market – and a partnership with EnCana, Canada’s largest independent oil and gas producer, was viewed as one of the most attractive options.The joint venture announced on Thursday will combine two of EnCana’s oil sands projects with two of ConocoPhilips’s oil refineries and will be composed of two 50-50 operating partnerships – one Canadian upstream partnership and one US downstream partnership.The upstream partnership includes EnCana’s projects at Foster Creek and Christina Lake, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in north-east Alberta.On the US side, the downstream partnership will be made up of ConocoPhillips’s Wood River and Borger refineries, located in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively.“With this strategic alliance, ConocoPhillips strengthens its presence in North America by repositioning 10 per cent of its US downstream business to access a large upstream resource base,” said Jim Mulva, ConocoPhillips’ chief executive.Randy Eresman, EnCana’s chief executive, added: “These partnerships provide greater certainty of execution for our oil sands projects by reducing cost and price rises and increasing confidence in our ability to achieve economic returns.”However, some analysts do not believe this is a wise move for EnCana, calling it a “bad deal” for the Canadian company and “a steal” for ConocoPhilips.“The transaction basically gives up 50 per cent in two-thirds of EnCana’s oil sands for positions in two refineries at the peak of the refining cycle,” said Ben P. Dell, a senior research analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.In early trade on Thursday, ConocoPhillips shares rose 1.8 per cent to $57.82. EnCana’s US-listed shares were up 1.7 per cent to $45.14.

Wal-Mart rose 2.1 per cent to $49.46.Financial services stocks made strong advances. JPMorgan added 1.9 per cent to $47.75, while mortgage finance group Fannie Mae gained 2.2 per cent to $55.73. St Paul Travelers climbed 2.5 per cent to $47.58.At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent, or 56.99 points, to 11,727.34, an all-time closing high. The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent or 2.79 points at 1,334.11; the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent, or 6.05 points, at 2,243.65.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards was cautious about the importance of the Dow’s milestone. “It’s probably of more significance to the retail investment community than it is to the professionals,” he said.“But I do think its a psychological plus and one that could spark some interest and maybe bring a little bit of sideline money into the market.”A slump in crude oil prices was the catalyst for the equity market gains. Nymex crude futures dipped below $59 a barrel – theirlowest level for eight months – triggering a sell-off of energy stocks. ConocoPhillips fell 4.3 per cent to $56.03, while oil services group Diamond Offshore Drilling lost 6.7 per cent to $63.90.The Dow Jones Oil Equipment and Services Index is now in negative territory for the year, having gained as much as 34 per cent from January to May.Copper and gold prices also slid further, dragging down mining stocks. Freeport McMoran lost 7.4 per cent to $49.50, while Newmont Mining sank 5.4 per cent to $40.89.Large cap technology stocks were boosted by the rally. Cisco Systems, maker of networking equipment added 1.9 per cent to $23.41, and Ebay gained 2.6 per cent to $28.18.Medical equipment maker St Jude Medical rose 3.4 per cent to $36.59, after Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”, saying St Jude would continue to take market share from rival Boston Scientific.Chipmaker Marvell Technology was a rare loser, tumbling 12 per cent to $16.80, its lowest level in a year and a half, after it cut its revenue outlook for 2007. Marvell said it would restate financial results because of the way it had accounted for stock options. Its rival Broadcom followed it lower, losing 3.1 per cent to $29.91."
636;COP;Conocophillips;2006-09-20T21:17:18Z;BP and Exxon at odds over Gulf oil project;;BP, the UK oil group, and ExxonMobil, its minority partner on the Thunder Horse deepsea oil project, have been at odds over how to respond to mounting problems with the Gulf of Mexico oilfield, the Financial Times has learned.BP admitted on Monday it would have to delay the project again, this time targeting 2008 for production from the world’s largest semi-submersible oil and gas platform.A BP employee told the FT that a range of problems, including inferior welding on the project’s distribution systems and other underwater equipment, along with numerous defects on the production, drilling and quarters platform, had caused the delay. This, he said, had led BP to contemplate a temporary bypass system that involves the completion of a workover riser, a connecting piece used to install equipment to complete the wells, to get oil flowing next year.Such a temporary structure would be a “very, very risky endeavour from a spill standpoint,” the employee said, adding that ExxonMobil, which owns 25 per cent of the project to BP’s 75 per cent ownership, had pushed for waiting until the permanent structure could be properly repaired before production begins. This would delay the start date until 2008, as BP admits, or even 2009.ExxonMobil said it did not discuss its business with co-venturers, because of commercial and proprietary considerations, and, therefore, would not confirm the claims of differences with BP on Thunderhorse. “However, on all ExxonMobil-related developments,” the company said, “whether operated by our company or others, we adhere to and also encourage others to abide by the highest standards of safety, health and environmental conduct in the design, construction and operation of facilities.”ExxonMobil, along with ConocoPhillips, are also BP’s partners at Prudhoe Bay, the Alaskan oilfield. BP, as operator, was forced to shut down half that field in August after discovering “severe corrosion” in the pipelines.Neither of BP’s partners have commented on any disagreements that may have arisen from the troubles in Alaska, which forced ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips to issue force majeure notifications to customers.As the operator of Prudhoe Bay, and the majority owner in Thunderhorse, BP is the key decision maker on those projects. Yet its partners are beginning to suffer from the fallout from BP’s decisions, which have led to state and federal investigations against the company following the corrosion in Alaska and a fatal refinery explosion last year in Texas.Analysts noted that ExxonMobil’s bottom line would be affected by the Thunderhorse delay, though not seriously, and said the partial closure of Prudhoe Bay would impact the earnings of both ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.
637;COP;Conocophillips;2006-08-31T18:54:25Z;BP is deserving of censure, but not a vendetta;;Environmentalists love to hate big oil companies. “I told you so,” we say to ourselves, as we learn about BP’s leaky oil pipes in Alaska. The fiasco in Alaska could spell serious trouble for BP, as the US Congress begins hearings. It is easy to cheer them on and urge them to take drastic actions against this corporate wrong doer. We should move beyond this knee-jerk reaction.BP has, in fact, been a model of responsible corporate citizenship on environmental matters. In a survey I conducted, BP was the most transparent big oil and gas company on key climate change issues debated in Congress. What is more, BP is practising what it preaches. It has established an emissions-reduction programme more stringent than that required in the US and many other parts of the world. Of the five oil and gas companies I surveyed, Royal Dutch Shell is the only company similar to BP in this regard. In contrast, Chevron, ­ConocoPhillips and Exxon-Mobil are all interested in technological solutions to the greenhouse emissions reduction. But while technological solutions are needed, they are by no means the panacea with which to combat climate change.Alaska’s attorney-general is right to initiate an intensive investigation, but environmentalists should help ensure that it is not turned into a vendetta. It is in the company’s interest to replace its corroded oil pipes and avoid a future repetition of the fiasco. Otherwise, it will not be able to keep pumping oil. In contrast, it is potentially in the interest of an up-and-coming politician to use this single issue as a springboard for a larger ­campaign.We should also be prepared for BP bashing in the congressional hearings that begin next week. There is a danger that some senators and representatives may use the Alaska problem as a club to retaliate against an oil company that has pushed hard for strong and responsible environmental measures. If environmentalists do not step up in support during BP’s time of need, it will be a lesson to other companies that it does not pay to be green.The marginalisation of BP would leave a vacuum that ExxonMobil and others would be happy to fill. ExxonMobil Company has consistently opposed strong action to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. If BP is pushed to the sidelines politically, which companies would fill the ­vacuum?To make matters worse, the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s trade association, confirms the environmentalists’ worst stereotypes of corporate irresponsibility. Red Cavaney, chief executive and president of API, has tried to undermine the Kyoto treaty by arguing that its focus on carbon dioxide is misdirected. Instead, he unpersuasively suggests that we should begin again by concentrating on another pollutant, methane. BP’s position is in stark contrast. Lord Browne, BP’s chief executive, has consistently recognised that CO2 is, indeed, a key element in global warming. If he is discredited, we would lose a very important voice in our political life.Responsible environmentalists should not treat big oil as if it were a single “axis of evil”. We should encourage aggressive action on the Alaska problems, but we should not join in stigmatising BP. We should not permit a few serious missteps to obscure the company’s record of environmental statesmanship. We should resist the temptation to use a single graphic debacle as a springboard to dramatise the general problem of corporate irresponsibility. We have too much to lose by engaging in this familiar public relations manoeuvre.We have much to gain by taking a problem-solving approach. By all means, we should push BP to act responsibly in Alaska, but we should make every effort to preserve the company as a credible political force for conservation in the future. With Lord Browne stepping down as head of the company, it is even more imperative to show the next generation of leaders that protecting the environment furthers concrete political and economic interests. Such a demonstration will serve to increase the number of green companies over time, and allow environmentalists to forge an increasingly broad-based coalition for responsible policymaking. This is the best way to generate politically sustainable gains in the years ahead.The writer is legislative affairs director for the Oregon League of Conservation Voters. Her study on corporate lobbying in Washington will be published in the Journal of Environmental Law in March 2007
638;COP;Conocophillips;2006-08-28T15:58:08Z;Crude prices slump as hurricane fears ease;;Crude oil prices fell sharply on Monday as the tropical storm in the Caribbean began to slow, reducing the threat of severe damage to oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.Ernesto became the Atlantic season’s first hurricane after being upgraded on Sunday. But winds began to ease and the hurricane was downgraded to tropical storm later the same day.By midday in New York, Nymex West Texas Intermediate for October delivery was down $2.16 at $70.35 a barrel. Although London’s ICE exchange was closed, October Brent was down $2.09 to $70.61 a barrel in electronic trade.The storm hit Cuba, forcing massive evacuations. Meanwhile, a hurricane watch remained in place in the US Florida Keys in case the storm gathered momentum again. But by early Monday morning, Ernesto packed sustained winds of 50 mph. A hurricane is a system with sustained winds of more than 74 mph.Among the oil companies in the region, Shell, BP and ConocoPhillips all said they were evacuating non-essential workers from their platforms in the region, but none reported any cuts in oil or natural gas output.The oil-price losses came in spite of Iran saying on Sunday that its atomic programme was “irreversible”. Concerns are mounting that the world’s fourth-largest exporter may use its oil supply as a bargaining tool should the United Nations, which has told Iran to suspend nuclear work by August 31, impose sanctions.However, Iran said it still sought talks with the UN on western concerns about its nuclear enrichment programme.“Energy prices should remain on the defensive for much of the week as Ernesto starts to fade from view, while the Iranian story still seems to be a ‘work-in-progress’,” said Edward Meir at Man Financial.
639;COP;Conocophillips;2006-08-20T17:04:09Z;BP ‘misrepresented corrosion data’;;As US federal and state investigators probe BP’s Alaska operations, the company’s insistence that it had no knowledge of the degree of corrosion in its Alaskan oil transit lines is coming under scrutiny.A veteran worker at Prudhoe Bay told the FT he and others had taken to US criminal investigators at the Environmental Protection Agency accusations that BP misrepresented corrosion data over the years to indicate its pipelines were in better shape than they were, even as it cut back on monitoring and prevention.The FT also spoke with a contract worker who has been in contact with the investigators.Daren Beaudo, BP spokesman, said: “We are aware of all of these claims and have a process in place to look into every concern that comes our way, given enough specificity to direct us to a place to look for answers.”The EPA is investigating the complaints, along with documents the workers submitted to back their claims.The state of Alaska said it had subpoenaed BP, as operator and an owner of the field, as well as its partners – ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, each of which own 36 per cent – and Chevron, which owns just over 1 per cent and Forest Oil, which owns less than 1 per cent.David Marquez, Alaska’s attorney-general, ordered all of them to preserve all documents including letters, messages, answering machine recordings and informal memoranda of oral communications relating to pipeline monitoring, inspections or maintenance, corrosion control and spills. He ordered they permit these documents to be inspected by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and turn over those designated by the inspector.The order broadens the fallout from the investigation to the co-owners of the field, who have left operation of Prudhoe Bay to BP. ConocoPhillips said it would co-operate. ExxonMobil was “reviewing the subpoena”.BP declined to comment on the subpeonas. As operator of the field, it is responsible for its upkeep.Its workers have taken to the federal investigators accusations that BP skewed findings by inspecting more areas of known good pipe than bad, creating blended data that left the impression the pipeline was in better shape than it was.BP said it did blend data – not to determine if action needed to be taken on the pipeline, but to determine concentration levels of chemical inhibitors. The veteran worker said that, starting in the late 1990s, BP reduced anti-corrosion chemical injection, or even stopped injection altogether during the final months of the year, to meet budget.Ronnie Chappell, BP spokesman, said it was difficult for BP to investigate this claim because “the 1990s started 16 years ago. The people and the programme have changed. The chemicals have changed. So have the ways we use them.”The worker said BP started using digital radiography film, which does not show the detail of ordinary film. Digital was cheaper then, and while the quality has improved early corrosion problems were hidden.Mr Beaudo said radiography enabled BP to acquire images without using chemicals or producing the physical waste of using film. “It’s faster and allows us real time information, and we can actually detect anomalies in the field, rather than hauling film back and forth for processing,’’ he said.While the worker agreed it was more convenient, he insisted radiography was not as accurate in revealing small detail. “Our contract inspectors placed a digital shot and a film shot of the same pipe anomaly side by side. The digital shot did not show the small pinholes as revealed in the film shot.’’And, he insisted, BP stopped using high-tech pigging equipment to clean and maintain oil transit lines because management did not want to pay for the pigging under its leadership. given the environment in which “production was everything”. ““The responsibility was left for the next management group, which would have come in every three to four years. Then the next management would do the same thing.’’Regulators ordered BP to resume pigging the oil transit lines, which it stopped 14 years ago on one line and eight years ago on the other, after the biggest ever spill at Prudhoe Bay, from a corroded transit line, in March.Mr Beaudo said the corrosion was not a function of budget or resource “but of an as yet unexplained corrosion mechanism that we continue to study”. BP has said the corrosion was microbiologically produced – it had not expected the bacteria to multiply in the lines. “We believed the programme we had in place worked and the low-risk nature of crude oil transit lines made corrosion unlikely in these lines,’’ Mr Beaudo said.But the veteran worker said: “BP was well aware of the damage . . . they were well aware of corrosion due to bacteria, which is always present.’’Mr Beaudo said: “The indiscriminate method in which it has manifested itself was a surprise.”

The stock had fallen as low as $22.99 on August 22 – 45 per cent down in the year to date.Other internet stocks to gain included Amazon, which rose 4.1 per cent to $29.09, and Yahoo, up 1.8 per cent at $28.91.Sears Holdings, the third largest retailer in the US, reported an 83 per cent rise in quarterly earnings, but investors took fright at the slowdown in sales and its shares fell 5.8 per cent to $141.29.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 2.05 points, at 1,297.48. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent, or 8.07 points, at 2,157.61. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 7.84 points, at 11,334.96.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said investors had been confident about the economy ever since the surprise of the weaker-than-expected producer price data earlier in the week.“[After] the PPI data, it was as if it flicked a switch for the bulls,” he said. “The soft landing argument is what has been moving the markets this week.”Hewlett-Packard added 2.1 per cent to $35.15 after it beat analysts’ expectations with its fiscal third-quarter earnings, announced a $6bn share buyback, and gave bullish earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. HP is now trading at its highest level since the beginning of 2001.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices added 7.2 per cent to $24.20 after it was raised from a “hold” to a “buy” rating by Citigroup. The stock has gained 20 per cent this week.The energy sector continued to fall as crude prices slid further. BJ Services slipped 3 per cent to $35.21 and Valero Energy sank 3.2 per cent to $61.03.Phelps Dodge fell 2.1 per cent to $90.01 and Freeport McMoran dropped 2.1 per cent to $53.58 as copper prices sank on speculation that a strike at the world’s largest copper mine in Chile might end.Research in Motion gained 2.7 per cent to $79.81 on rumours that it would release a version of its Blackberry mobile email device with enhanced multimedia capabilities.Enterprise software group Salesforce.com soared 19 per cent to $33.70 following second-quarter results that came in ahead of analysts’ estimates.
641;COP;Conocophillips;2006-08-14T20:43:34Z;Wall St up despite late decline;;Wall Street pared gains on Monday after a strong morning rally driven by lower oil prices and more positive news from the Middle East fizzled out.All the major indices had been up by at least 1 per cent on the day but began trading lower in mid-afternoon to finish only modestly higher.Ceasefire news dragged crude prices and energy sector stocks lower. Of the 10 worst performing stocks in the S&P 500, six were in the sector. ConocoPhillips sank 2.3 per cent to $66.82, while Valero Energy lost 2.4 per cent to $63.24.Airline stocks, however, were among the beneficiaries. JetBlue Airways added 2.3 per cent to $10.06 and American Airlines’ parent AMR gained 2.3 per cent to $19.26.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.47 points, at 1,268.21. The Nasdaq Composite had gained 0.6 per cent, or 11.33 points, at 2,069.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 9.84 points at 11,097.87.Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said the afternoon fall was caused by traders closing positions ahead of the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Tuesday.“What we’re seeing is traders taking any opportunity to bag a profit, even if it’s on a one-day move, especially if it’s in front of a PPI number,” he said.Caterpillar was one of the most whipsawed stocks of the day. It climbed as high as 2.4 per cent, only to turn lower, and close down 1.6 per cent to $65.96.Technology stocks staged a rally. Intel ticked up 2.6 per cent to $17.87. Software-maker Oracle rose 2 per cent to $15.29 after it said it was increasing its stake in Indian software company I-flex.Networking equipment maker Cisco Systems gained following bullish comments in Barron’s, the weekly investment magazine, which said the company would benefit from telecommunications companies upgrading their networks. Its shares added 2.8 per cent to $20.09. Juniper Networks also gained, adding 2 per cent to $12.44.Ford Motor gained 6.2 per cent to $7.83 after the stock was upgraded from “underperform” to “outperform” by Bear Stearns. Ford has gained 25 per cent in the past three weeks.SunTrust Banks tumbled 3.8 per cent to $76.55, its worst single-day loss since May 2004. The fall came after it lowered its full-year forecast for net interest income growth due to rising competition and interest rate pressures. The bank said credit losses could rise due to a $200m non-performing loan.Dillard’s, the department store, jumped 5.6 per cent to $33.08 after it swung to a $15.7m profit in the second quarter from a loss in the same period last year. Nordstrom, which reports earnings on Thursday, gained 1.5 per cent to $34.81, while Federated Department Stores gained 2.7 per cent to $36.90.

BP will manage to keep half of the output from the western half of the Prudhoe Bay oilfield flowing with production expected to rise to 200,000 barrels a day by the end of August from about 150,000 barrels a day currently.However, ExxonMobil has followed ConocoPhillips in declaring force majeure on shipments of Alaska crude.Nymex September unleaded gasoline fell just over 8 cents to $1.9805 a gallon.Traders said attention was now likely to return to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, with a deadline for action by the UN’s Security Council only two weeks away.The situation in Nigeria also continued to worry the market after four more foreign oil workers were kidnapped in Port Harcourt yesterday, the fifth kidnapping this month.“Oil bears would be advised to tread cautiously, at least through the next several weeks,” said Edward Meir of Man Financial.Gold eased 0.8 per cent to $627.20 a troy ounce, as the metal came under pressure following the easing of tensions in the Middle East. Traders reported buying interest returning from jewellery makers as prices moved below the $630 level.Silver firmed 0.8 per cent at $11.97 a troy ounce, bucking the weakness elsewhere in precious metals. Platinum fell 1.7 per cent to $1,219 a troy ounce while palladium dropped 1.6 per cent to $312 a troy ounce.The latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed speculative long positions for palladium have declined from an all-time high of 1.17m ounces in April to 615,000 ounces currently.John Reade of UBS said speculators were exiting following a sharp decline for the palladium price following its peak above $400 a ounce in May, but that more downward pressure was possible.Copper rose 1.4 per cent to $7,675 a tonne as the strike at Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine in Chile, moved into a second week. No concrete developments were reported from weekend talks between management and the union.Aluminium fell 1.3 per cent to $2,488 a tonne while zinc traded 0.5 per cent lower at $3,245 a tonne.
643;COP;Conocophillips;2006-07-28T21:55:10Z;Chevron fails to profit from oil price rises;;Chevron, the second biggest oil producer in the US, on Friday said earnings came in below Wall Street expectations after a week in which its main rivals delivered big numbers.Net second-quarter earnings rose 18 per cent to $4.4bn, or $1.97 a share, from $3.7bn, or $1.76 per share, a year ago. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.21 a share.The results included the $300m cost of repairing and removing infrastructure damaged by last year’s hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the Gulf of Mexico. Excluding this Chevron made $2.10 a share.The rising oil price meant that the company lost money on earlier sales at lower prices, which hit profits by 11 cents a share, the company said.Chevron’s results come despite the beneficial impact the high price of oil has had on other large oil companies’ earnings.On Thursday, ExxonMobil and Shell reported results that both easily beat expectations. The day before, ConocoPhillips reported quarterly earnings of more than $5bn for the first time.“They [Chevron] missed expectations in every single division,” said Paul Sankey, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. “Particularly considering the competition this is a very weak result.”Revenue rose 11 per cent to $53.5bn.Exploration and production net income for Chevron rose 18 per cent to $3.3bn. Refining, marketing and transportation rose 2 per cent to $998m. However, higher income tax rates and an increase in operating expenses led its international downstream business to report income down by 23 per cent.Speaking on a conference call with analysts Dave O’Reilly, chairman and chief executive, said the company did not view its European downstream operations “as a core part of our business,” and confirmed that the company was looking to sell its stake in the Dutch-based Nerefco oil refinery and its fuel stations in the Benelux region.The company said this was partially offset by improved results in the US, due to higher margins for refined products and a higher refinery utilisation rate.Chevron produced 2.67m barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, an increase of 10 per cent on the year, brought by the addition of production from former Unocal operations.The company expects to take a one-off tax hit of $200m in the third quarter from UK tax rises. Chevron paid off $1.7bn of debt assumed with last year’s acquisition of Unocal and bought back $1.3bn of shares. It said it would complete a $5bn buy-back programme by year-end.“Strong” cash flows helped fund $4bn of capital expenditure in the second quarter, the company said.Shares in Chevron ended the session 2.5 per cent lower at $66.05.
644;COP;Conocophillips;2006-07-26T21:25:48Z;Market Overview: Fed’s report of mild inflationary pressure fails to lift drifting Dow;;"The publication by the US Federal Reserve’s beige book, which compiles anecdotal evidence on the health of the US economy from around the country, on Wednesday failed to lift stock markets at the end of another day of uncertainty over the outlook for corporate earnings and the economy.The beige book surprised the market both with stronger evidence of an economic slowdown than had been expected and with relatively little evidence of inflationary pressures. It said: “Increases in wages and in prices of final goods and services remained modest on net.” It added: “A few districts noted a moderation in prices for some items.”This appeared to reduce the chances of a rate rise at the Fed’s meeting next month. The futures market moved to put the probability of a rise at 47 per cent, while two-year Treasury bond yields dropped 4.3 basis points to 5.08 per cent.But the news did not spark a rally for stocks. By the close, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent.A strong second-quarter earnings season was again overshadowed by disappointments by high-profile, large companies.Amazon was the latest bellwether stock to disappoint after it reported a sharp fall in second-quarter earnings and cut its forecast for the full year. This added to concerns that the US economy was slowing.There were also disappointments in the results of Corning, a maker of liquid crystal display components, and Boeing, which had not been as optimistic on its outlook for 2007 as anticipated.These disappointments were offset by better-than-expected numbers from ConocoPhillips and General Motors. Thomson Financial said these two companies helped spur a sharp jump in the expected second-quarter earnings growth for the S&P 500 companies based on consensus forecasts.Thomson said the blended estimated growth rate – reported numbers plus forecast figures – had risen to 15.1 per cent from 10.9 per cent at the start of the quarter. Thomson added that of the 246 S&P 500 companies to have reported second-
quarter results so far, 68 per cent posted earnings above expectations, 17 per cent reported in line with forecasts and 15 per cent disappointed. The positive surprise rate compared with a long-term average of 60 per cent and a more recent average of 66 per cent.For the full year, the forecast earnings growth for the S&P 500 constituents was 14.1 per cent. The expected growth for next year was 10.5 per cent.In Europe, shares shrugged off mixed earnings results, the third profit warning in a year from Peugeot and data showing a fall in German business confidence. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 5.28 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 1,320.81.The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of around 7,000 firms, fell to 105.6 from 106.8 in June. The fall in the index was the largest since March 2005.“The first cracks are starting to appear in Germany’s business confidence boom,” said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. “After recently notching up a fresh 15-year high in June it looked like a correction in Ifo confidence was long overdue.”The dip in the Ifo index did little to dent expectations that the ECB will raise interest rates by a quarter-point to 3 per cent next week. Yields on 10-year Bunds rose 1.4 basis points to 3.977 per cent."
645;COP;Conocophillips;2006-07-26T21:12:33Z;Wall Street unmoved by mixed earnings;;Wall Street closed flat on Wednesday as investors were pulled in opposite directions by economic data and mixed earnings reports.Stocks moved sideways most of the morning, but ticked higher following the afternoon release of the Fed’s beige book, a report on regional economic conditions that suggested price pressures in the US were contained.Markets took the news as making it less likely that the Fed would raise interest rates at its next meeting. However, the rally was not enough to distract investors from disappointing earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Corning and others.At the close, the S&P 500 was flat, down 0.48 points, at 1,268.40, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent, or 3.44 points, at 2,070.46. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, down 1.20 points, at 11,102.51.General Motors reported a net loss of $3.2bn in the second quarter as charges related to the carmaker’s employee buyout programme took a heavy financial toll. But operating earnings were $1.2bn, ahead of analyst estimates, pushing shares 4.4 per cent higher to $32.00.Online retailer Amazon reported a 58 percen fall in quarterly earnings. Shares plunged 21.8 per cent to $26.26, their lowest level in more than three years.However, other technology stocks did better. Apple Computer gained 3.1 per cent to $63.87 and Sun Microsystems rose 4.4 per cent to $4.27 after reporting an increase in quarterly revenue.Corning fell 14.5 per cent to $18.52 after it warned that third-quarter sales would miss analysts’ forecasts.

650;COP;Conocophillips;2006-06-23T23:01:40Z;Anadarko unveils twin deals worth $21bn;;Anadarko Petroleum will become the biggest independent oil and gas company in the US, as it pays $21bn in cash, and premiums of close to 50 per cent, for the twin acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western Gas Resources.The surprise deals, unveiled on Friday, are the latest examples of rampant consolidation in the energy sector, kicked off last year with Chevron’s purchase of Unocal and ConocoPhillips’ acquisition of Burlington Resources. The Kerr-McGee deal included a 40 per cent premium over Thursday’s closing share price while there was a 49 per cent premium on the Western deal, highlighting the perception within the industry that the market is undervaluing assets.But investors seemed sceptical. Anadarko’s share price slid 7.2 per cent to $44.90 on Friday, while Kerr-McGee rose 36 per cent to $68.61 and Western Gas closed nearly 46 per cent higher at $59.67.Jim Hackett, Anadarko’s chairman, president and chief executive, said: “We are creating a combined company with industry-leading positions in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico and the Rockies, two of the fastest-growing oil and natural gas producing regions in North America.”The deep-water Gulf has yielded significant oil discoveries in recent years, while the Rockies are a big gas source. The separate deals double Anadarko’s sales amid high energy prices, and will help it meet shareholder demands for the sector to lower costs and put more into reinvesting.Including the assumption of $2.2bn in debt, the deals will cost Anadarko $23bn. Anadarko will pay $16.4bn for Kerr-McGee, or $70.50 per Kerr-McGee share, plus the assumption of $1.6bn in debt and other liabilities. It will pay $4.7bn for Western Gas, or $61 per share, plus the assumption of $600m in debt and other liabilities.Lehman Brothers, one of two financial advisors to Kerr-McGee, said the price compared “extremely favourably” to recent premiums in the exploration and production sector, which have averaged 24 per cent since 2001.Mr Hackett admitted paying “significant premiums’’, ahead of recent premiums in the sector, averaging 24 per cent over the past five years, but said the market has undervalued the companies.“We believe we are capturing a substantial disconnect between current property valuations and equity market valuations, and gaining some exceptional properties and talent in the process,’’ Mr Hackett said.Some analysts did not dispute the value placed on the assets. Derek Butter, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said: “Basically, what you have is a big bet on US medium and long-term gas prices remaining high.”Most of the assets are natural gas, and analysts predict prices for natural gas will remain above historical levels because of growing demand for the energy source amid declining output from maturing fields.Beyond the assets, Mr Hackett stressed the importance of gaining experienced, qualified employees, given a labor market that has tightened with the rush to develop energy assets to cash in on high commodity prices.Anadarko will finance the acquisitions through a $24bn, 364-day committed acquisition facility provided by UBS, Credit Suisse and Citigroup. It will put proceeds from asset sales, free cash flow from operations and the issuance of equity toward reducing debt over the next two years.Anadarko was advised by Credit Suisse and UBS. acted as financial advisors, Goldman Sachs provided a fairness opinion and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld acted as legal counsel.In addition to Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan also acted as financial advisor to Kerr-McGee, and Covington & Burling acted as legal counsel. Morgan Stanley and Petrie Parkman acted as Western’s financial advisors, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom served as its legal advisors.

653;COP;Conocophillips;2006-06-01T08:48:15Z;Vivendi settles Seagrams tax dispute;;Vivendi has settled a long-running tax dispute with the US Internal Revenue Service that will see it wipe a $1.85bn liability off its books by making a payment of $686m.The agreement ends a corporate drama that dates back to 1981 which Vivendi inherited in 2000 with the acquisition of Seagram, the Canadian liquor and entertainment company.Seagram and Du Pont, the US chemicals group, in 1981 struck a deal after battling for control of Conoco, the US energy group, which saw Seagram’s hand over control of Conoco in exchange for a 20 per cent stake in Du Pont.Seagram built its Du Pont stake to 24.1 per cent before selling it back to Du Pont in April 1995 for $8.8bn. The deal was seen as advantageous for Du Pont, which bought back its shares for $56 each when the market price was $64.It also allowed Seagram make its first significant foray into the entertainment business, buying 80 per cent of Hollywood studio MCA for $7bn.Du Pont’s repurchase of its shares was structured so as to minimise tax liabilities for Seagram, which reported most of the income from the sale as dividend proceeds. Seagram was already embroiled in a dispute with the IRS on a tax ruling related to the original Du Pont/Conoco transaction in 1981, which the company susequently won in 1996.Vivendi, which bought Seagram in 2000 for $34bn in a controversial deal under former chief executive Jean-Marie Messier, said on Thursday that the agreement struck with the IRS also meant it could sell a remaining holding in Du Pont of 16.4m shares, subject to normal capital gains provisions.At the DuPont closing price on May 30, this would be worth about $700m, Vivendi said.Vivendi shares were 1 per cent higher to €28.27 in morning trade.

655;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink.

656;COP;Conocophillips;2006-05-24T19:58:23Z;Safety of Alaska oil tanks questioned;;The safety of massive oil tanks in Alaska is being questioned this week as the House of Representatives prepares to debate opening more of the state?s environmentally protected areas to oil exploration.The tanks, owned by Alyeska Pipeline Service ? a company owned by oil giants BP, Exxon and ConocoPhillips ? were investigated several years ago and deemed fit for service. But this month a member of the Joint Pipeline Office (JPO), which combines federal and state regulators to ensure the safety of Alaska?s oil industry, approached Glen Plumlee, a former senior financial analyst at Alyeska, to discuss the situation again, Mr Plumlee said.Mr Plumlee detailed the concerns of the JPO emp?loyee in a letter to Chuck Hamel, a former Alaska oil worker who brings whistleblower complaints to regulators.The letter revives the earlier claims of faulty welding, saying regulators under the JPO agreed to permit the work despite the risk posed to the environment.?Catastrophic failure of even one Valdez tank could endanger the entire terminal, pollute Prince William Sound on the order of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, as well as stop a substantial portion of the entire domestic US crude oil supply while the terminal is repaired and the spill contained,? Mr Plumlee said.The letter states that if even one tank, each of which holds 510,000 barrels of oil, should give way, the environmental impact would be disastrous. The Exxon Valdez spill, the largest ever in the US, leaked 260,000 barrels of oil.Rhea DoBosh, JPO spokeswoman, said a JPO employee was contacted by an Environmental Protection Agency investigator a week ago to discuss employee concerns about the tanks. The JPO employee, who has asked for anonymity, told the FT that he would have to get permission from the agents before discussing the issue and referred further questions to Ms DoBosh.Both the JPO and Alyeska deny any problem with the welding, as they did previously.?There is no integrity risk regarding the crude oil storage tanks at the Valdez Marine Terminal,?? said Mike Heatwole, Alyeska spokesman. ?The issues we?ve been discussing are old issues that have been thoroughly reviewed ? internally and externally.??Regardless of how the matter unfolds, the allegations are likely to renew concerns about Alaska?s oil industry in the House debate. The industry has recently been criticised for a big spill and corrosion issues at Prudhoe Bay, north America?s largest oil field, which is co-owned by Alyeska?s owners.People in Alaska have expressed their own concerns. ?We don?t want a full tank of oil coming down the hill into our water,? said Stan Stevens, president of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens? Advisory Council, a congressionally mandated group charged with environmental oversight of oil terminals and tankers in the area.
657;COP;Conocophillips;2006-05-21T17:22:00Z;Saudi Arabia agrees $6bn oil refinery deal with Total;;Saudi Arabia has embarked on an ambitious plan to boost its oil refining capacity by joining forces with Total, the French energy company, to build a $6bn (€4.7bn £3.2bn) refinery on its Persian Gulf coast.The memorandum of understanding between Total and Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, is the first step of a process aimed at increasing the kingdom’s refining output by as much as 60 per cent in the next five years.Aramco is also in talks with ConocoPhillips, the US oil group, to build a large-scale refinery on Saudi Arabia’s west coast.As well as record crude prices, energy markets are suffering from a shortage in capacity at refineries, which turn oil into petrol, diesel, heating oil and other petroleum products.Abdallah Jum’ah, Saudi Aramco’s chief executive, said on Sunday that his company’s plans would help ease the burden.“This proposed project [with Total] represents an excellent opportunity to build on the kingdom’s strategy of addressing global energy demand while attracting foreign investment to expand its economy,” he said.It is difficult for companies operating in the US and Europe to build new refineries because of environmental concerns. Western companies also worry about making heavy investments in a business that has fallen prey to cyclical downturns in the past.Buoyed by the oil price, Saudi Arabia has earmarked $50bn to invest in its energy industry, including the plan to increase refining capacity from 2.1m barrels of oil per day (b/d) to 3.4m by 2011.The joint venture with Total will create a 400,000 b/d facility at the industrial city of Jubail on the east coast.The Conoco talks are aimed at building a plant with the same capacity at Yanbu on the Red Sea coast.Both facilities will create petroleum and diesel products for export to the US and Europe and other markets.Aramco and Total have formed a company to build the new plant, with both owning a 35 per cent stake.They plan to sell the remaining 30 per cent to the Saudi public through a share offering. Saudi Arabia is keen to promote public ownership in new refining ventures.ExxonMobil, the US oil group, and Royal Dutch Shell, its Anglo-Dutch rival, already operate joint refining ventures in the kingdom.

Although producer price data were benign, they were followed by worryingly robust consumer price numbers, which fanned fears that the Federal Reserve would be forced to raise rates again in June.Analysts said weak commodity stocks and inflation concerns were the key drivers behind the week’s decline in equity prices.“I would give equal weight to [commodities prices and] continued concern that inflationary fears will keep the Fed on a tightening trend,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The market didn’t think this was the case for the first four months of the year and it did some adjusting this week.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent, or 5.22 points, for the day at 1,267.03, down 1.9 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite picked up, gaining 0.6 per cent, or 13.56 points for the day at 2,193.88 – a loss of 2.2 per cent for the week. on Friday the index finally broke eight days of consecutive declines, its worse losing streak since September 1994.The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up on Friday, adding 0.1 per cent, or 15.77 points, to 11,144.06, a fall of 2.1 per cent since Monday.In a depressing week for the markets, retail offered some therapy. It was the only major sector to end higher, thanks to mostly strong earnings reports.Robust numbers lifted Sears Holdings after it surprised investors with a
19 per cent increase in quarterly profit. The company’s shares gained 16.1 per cent to $161.89 for the week, its highest level since July of last year. It was the best performer in the S&P 500.The markets also warmed to Wal-Mart. The world’s largest retailer nudged up
1.7 per cent to $47.32 after it announced a 6 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The results, ahead of forecasts, offset a warning that high energy prices could affect results for this quarter.Others were less fortunate. Wal-Mart’s rival Target fell 5.8 per cent to $49.16, in spite of news of a 12 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. The stock was undermined by concerns about the retailer’s shrinking margins.Staples slid 7.9 per cent to $24.52. Although profits rose strongly, investors took fright at sluggish same-store sales that rose just 1 per cent, the slowest rate in three years.The commodities bull run finally looked like it might be running out of steam after a broad-based sell-off on Monday dragged oil and metals lower. A brief rally on Tuesday failed to hold, and Nymex crude for June settled on Friday at $68.53, down 5 per cent for the week, while gold and copper also fell steeply. The S&P Metals and Mining Index was down 10.2 per cent for the week.“The good news is that this takes a bit of the inflationary fears away,” said Mr Hogan.Oil services company Noble shed 11.2 per cent to $68.98, its lowest level since November 2005. ConocoPhillips sank 3.8 per cent to $62.72.Mining and materials stocks also suffered. Barrick Gold shed 9 per cent to $30.56 and Phelps Dodge, the copper producer, lost 12.9 per cent to $83.06. Aluminium producer Alcoa fell 8 per cent to $31.98.One of biggest decliners over the week was Carnival Cruises which shed 12.8 per cent to $40.71 after it cut its outlook for 2006. Of the 10 worst performing stocks on the S&P 500, Carnival was the only stock not involved in energy or mining.Technology stocks were on the move as Advanced Micro Devices surged 10.4 per cent to $34.95 after Dell Computer announced it would no longer exclusively use Intel chips in its PCs. Intel was down 3.6 per cent to $18.36 on the news.But Apple continued to fall, losing 3.5 per cent to $64.51 as Singapore-based rival Creative Labs accused it of patent infringement, prompting a counter-suit from Apple."
659;COP;Conocophillips;2006-05-17T23:12:26Z;Morgan Stanley shifts energy investment team;;Morgan Stanley on Wednesday moved to strengthen its energy investment banking team, moving one of its top bankers to Houston from New York and hiring two more amid a dealmaking boom brought on by high commodity prices.In an internal memorandum obtained by the Financial Times, Morgan Stanley said that Thomas Langford, who last year advised Unocal on the takeover battle between China’s CNOOC and Chevron of the US, would relocate from New York to Houston to become head of investment banking for the southwest region.In addition, Mr Langford, who last year worked on the $35bn merger of ConocoPhillips with Burlington Resources, and this week advised on Marathon Oil’s sale of its Russian assets to Lukoil, will keep the title of co-head of energy investment banking.In a separate memo, Morgan Stanley revealed that it had hired Peter Bowden, a former corporate lawyer at Andrew Kurth, and Ryan Moss, a UBS banker, to join its global energy group based in Houston.Mr Langford’s move and the two additions reflect an attempt by Morgan Stanley to bolster its commitment to energy banking at a time when high commodity prices are leading to a string of initial public offerings in the industry.In addition, there have been a number of large corporate takeovers, although that activity has been limited by buyers’ unwillingness to pay high valuations for companies.“The decision to relocate one of our most senior energy investment bankers to Houston demonstrates our commitment to our regional client base,” the internal memo said.In his new role, Mr Langford will be taking over from Michael Dee, who will remain at Morgan Stanley with different responsibilities.After losing a number of senior dealmakers, including Joseph Perella and Paulo Pereira, in the wake of last year’s executive turmoil, Morgan Stanley has recently announced a number of high-profile hires to help fill the gap.These include Christopher Carter, a former senior investment banking executive at Credit Suisse, who will be based in London, and Robert Kindler, the former global head of mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase, who will be based in New York.As adviser to Unocal last year, Mr Langford had to help the company’s board make the difficult decision between sticking with a lower takeover offer from Chevron and embracing a higher bid from CNOOC.In the end, Unocal continued to support Chevron’s bid, which was revised only slightly higher during the takeover battle on the grounds that it was less risky from a regulatory perspective.The prospect of a state-owned Chinese company taking control of a large US oil group elicited strong political opposition from many US politicians, even though most of Unocal’s assets were in Asia.
660;COP;Conocophillips;2006-05-08T21:39:44Z;Venezuela acts to secure increase in oil taxes;;Venezuela could as soon as Tuesday deliver fast-track approval for an increase in the tax and royalty rates it levies on four major foreign investments that account for a quarter of output from the world’s fifth largest oil exporter.Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister, said on Monday that the proposal to raise tax and royalty rates on the Orinoco River Belt projects, which convert about 600,000 barrels per day (b/d) of extra-heavy crude into lighter, synthetic oil for export, would be submitted for approval by the country’s legislature on Tuesday.Tax increases on the Orinoco projects had been rumoured, but the speed with which they look set to be implemented mirrors the suddenness with which Bolivia last week announced the nationalisation of its natural gas fields.President Hugo Chávez, who has offered full backing to Bolivian President Evo Morales for his nationalisation plans, announced only last Sunday he wanted to increase income tax on the Orinoco projects from 34 per cent to 50 per cent, and double the royalty rate from 16.7 per cent to 33.3 per cent.Mr Chávez enjoys practically full and unalloyed support in the legislature, or National Assembly, and the measure’s prompt approval is virtually guaranteed.The tax and royalty increases will affect ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil of the US, as well as Total of France and Statoil of Norway. About $17bn has been invested in the four Orinoco projects since their inception in the late 1990s, and the projects are today estimated to be worth about $33bn.On Sunday, Mr Chávez said that Venezuela would tap extra revenue from the world oil price boom through what he termed an “extraction tax” on the Orinoco Belt operations, which are known as “strategic association” projects.“For next year the extra revenue looks like it will come to more than a billion dollars,” he said.Venezuela’s move to boost rates on the heavy-oil projects follows measures taken last month to convert 32 separate operating contracts, which accounted for about 500,000 b/d, into joint ventures in which the state holds majority stakes.That move upset some oil multinationals. Total and Italy’s Eni, which objected to the conversions, saw their oilfields unilaterally taken over by the government, so far without compensation.Humberto Calderón Berti, a former energy minister, warned that Venezuela might also seek conversion of the Orinoco projects into state-majority joint ventures.
661;COP;Conocophillips;2006-05-04T04:05:02Z;JPMorgan selects duo to lead M&A branch;;"JPMorgan Chase has named Jimmy Elliott and Dag Skattum to head its mergers and acquisitions advisory business, which is one of the largest in the world but last month suffered the defection of its top banker.Mr Elliott, based in New York, and Mr Skattum, based in London, were chosen as internal candidates to jointly replace Robert Kindler, who recently left his role as co-head of global M&A at JPMorgan to take a senior position at rival Morgan Stanley.The promotion of Mr Elliott and Mr Skattum reunites a well-known duo on Wall Street. The two bankers ran JPMorgan’s M&A business for two years before its 2000 merger with Chase.The pair is taking over amid a boom in corporate dealmaking around the world, which is allowing investment banks to capture large fees. JPMorgan, whose deals advisory business lagged behind its rivals in the early part of this decade, has recaptured market share in recent years.According to Dealogic, JPMorgan was ranked second in the global M&A advisory league tables so far this year, having worked on 131 deals worth $355.3bn, or a market share of 29.5 per cent. In Europe, JPMorgan was in first place, while in the US it ranked fourth.Both Mr Elliott and Mr Skattum are “generalist” M&A bankers, whose work spans different industries and geographies. Mr Elliott’s career began at First Boston, where he worked alongside renowned Wall Street dealmakers Bruce Wasserstein, now chief executive of Lazard, and Joseph Perella, who last year left Morgan Stanley to set up his own firm. Mr Elliott, a Texas native, did not join JPMorgan until 1997, and his most recent deals have been in the energy sector.Last year, he advised Burlington Resources on its $37bn sale to ConocoPhillips; CNOOC on its aborted attempt to take over Unocal; and Kerr McGee in its proxy fight with activist investor Carl Icahn.Dag Skattum, a dual national of the US and Norway, has been with JPMorgan since 1986. Last year, he led the bank’s work on Pernod Ricard’s $14bn takeover of Allied Domecq, the British drinks company, and helped advise on a private equity consortium’s $12bn acquisition of Danish telecoms group TDC. He is also working for the government of Luxembourg in the takeover battle between steel giants Arcelor and Mittal."
662;COP;Conocophillips;2006-05-02T16:24:37Z;Duke Energy unmoved by missed estimates;;Duke Energy, the largest US utility, on Tuesday reported earnings excluding special items that missed estimates following the divestment from a gas venture, but added that full-year earnings would beat forecasts.The company said per-share earnings excluding items were up 11.6 per cent to 48 cents, a penny shy of average analyst estimates.Net earnings fell 59 per cent to $358m, or 37 cents per share, from $866m, or 88 cents, thanks to last year’s gain from an asset sale.Duke sold a 19.7 per cent stake in Duke Energy Field Services, a gas-processing business, to ConocoPhillips. The company has disposed of assets worth more than $6bn in the past three years, exiting unprofitable business include power generation.The company became the largest utility operator in the US after the $9.2bn acquisition of Cinergy in April amid a trend of consolidation in the sector.James Rogers, chief executive, said Duke’s “electric and gas operations delivered solid performances this quarter” and said it was happy with a full-year earnings target of $1.90 per share, 6 cents above estimates.Cinergy, whose results were separate from Duke’s in the first quarter, saw per-share earnings after items rise 3.3 per cent to 62 cents, from 60 cents a year ago. Net earnings per share fell 35 per cent to 39 cents.Duke’s pipeline business reported 6.6 per cent growth in earnings, while its international energy division surged almost 28 per cent to $87m, compared with $68m in the previous year.The company attributed the jump to strong prices and revenues in Latin America.As part of its restructuring process, Duke has said it is looking to divest from its gas distribution business and has hired Lazard to look for strategic options for the operation, which includes more than 17,500 miles of pipeline.
663;COP;Conocophillips;2006-04-28T16:31:12Z;Chevron profits jump on strong crude prices;;"Chevron, the second biggest US oil company, on Friday followed its rivals ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips in announcing strong financial results.As Congress discusses everything from taxpayer rebates to imposing taxes on oil company profits to quell anger over the rising prices at the pump, Chevron reported a 48 per cent increase in net income to $4bn for the first quarter.US petrol prices have risen to above $3 a gallon, tracking the rise in oil prices to over $70 a barrel.Chevron's better-than-expected earnings of $1.80 a share, up 41 per cent from last year, were given a boost by the company’s nearly 10 per cent increase in oil-equivalent production from a year ago because of its acquisition of Unocal. That acquisition also helped boost Chevron’s revenue, which rose 32 per cent to $54bn over the year-earlier period.“The outperformance was spread through the divisions,” said Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse First Boston.In an election year, politicians are eager to be seen addressing the rise in petrol prices and have made oil companies the focus of their ire. The companies note that they have spent many years and billions of dollars to bring the product to market and, just as they suffered through the lean years, they should be rewarded when prices are high.Former Chevron executive to head Archer Daniels Midland

664;COP;Conocophillips;2006-04-28T13:13:39Z;Chávez quickens drive to wrest oil revenues;;President Hugo Chávez is raising the pace at which his government asserts “full sovereignty” over Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, the largest in the Americas.The government is expected to raise royalties and taxes, possibly by as much as double, on four facilities in the Orinoco River Belt that convert extra-heavy crude into lighter synthetic oil for export. Pressed on the issue this week, Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister, said Venezuela’s relationship with the companies operating in the Orinoco Belt would be “adjusted”.ChevronTexaco, Conoco-Phillips and ExxonMobil of the US, as well as Total of France and Statoil of Norway, variously hold important stakes in the four Orinoco Belt’s so-called “strategic association” projects, set up in the 1990s. Some $17bn has been invested in the projects since then. Now worth about $33bn (€26.6bn, £18.5bn), they produce 600,000 barrels of oil a day, nearly a quarter of Venezuela’s total production.Industry experts warn that Venezuela’s drive to wrest a greater share of revenue from foreign oil companies by hiking taxes and expropriating some assets may prompt energy multinationals to abandon the country.Patrick Esteruelas, a Latin America analyst at the Eurasia Group consultancy in New York, said a steep increase in taxes on the four projects – in which Petróleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, the state-owned oil company, holds minority shares – may scupper investment, especially if oil prices decline.“Should oil prices dip and the returns become less attractive, private foreign investors and state-owned companies that Venezuela is hoping to lure to the Orinoco will reconsider,” said Mr Esteruelas.Initially, the projects were seen as pioneering experiments that allowed Venezuela to begin commercially exploiting its huge reserves of extra-heavy oil. Development of the Orinoco Belt is the key to the country’s economic future, as reservoirs of lighter oils elsewhere in the country run dry.If the Orinoco’s estimated 235bn barrels of extra-heavy crude oil deposits are included in the reckoning, Venezuela’s reserves are the largest in the world.Teodoro Petkoff, a former economy minister and opposition candidate in December’s presidential elections, warns that heightened uncertainty in the energy sector will prevent Venezuela from fulfilling its potential.“If you include heavy oil, we have the largest reserves in the world. Yet Saudi Arabia produces several times more oil than us,” Mr Petkoff said. “That’s an incredible paradox.”Venezuela, currently the world’s fifth largest oil exporter, is producing less than its quota agreed with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. When oil prices were low in the 1990s, and the technology used in the Orinoco largely untested, the government agreed to favourable terms – such as a royalty rate of only 1 per cent for a period – to make the projects viable.Today, as crude oil prices touch record highs, producer nations step up efforts to snatch what they see as their rightful share of the energy price windfall reaped by private oil companies.What appears to vex an increasing number of oil multinationals operating in Venezuela, however, is the apparent arbitrariness of the measures being adopted by the Chávez government, rather than an increase in taxes or royalties.This month, Venezuela took control of two mature oilfields operated by Total and Italy’s Eni after the two companies failed to agree to a unilateral move to convert the units into joint ventures in which Pdvsa would hold a majority stake. About 500,000 b/d of oil was being produced through 32 operating contracts that were also set up in the 1990s.Other companies reluctantly agreed to form joint ventures. But ExxonMobil refused and sold its stake in the affected oilfield. Eni has threatened to sue the government for breach of contract.A new hydrocarbons law that was pushed through by the government in 2001 allows for tax increases on future projects but not on existing ones.The risk for Venezuela, analysts say, is that arbitrariness and expropriations could lead to a collapse in foreign investment and a sharp drop in output. Venezuela needs considerable foreign investment to maintain its oil production, which has dropped by about 25 per cent in the past five years because of lack of investment by Pdvsa in its refineries and oil wells.“It’s justifiable that an oil state should seek better terms to participate in the oil windfall,” said Orlando Ochoa, an independent economist. “But it’s a mistake to do it in a way that is threatening and arbitrary. The exploitation of heavy oil requires partnership and long-term commitment.”After Mexico nationalised its oil industry, US and British companies fled the country in the 1940s and many settled in Venezuela. Ironically, Mr Ochoa said, it may soon be Venezuela that shows oil companies the door.
665;COP;Conocophillips;2006-04-26T21:30:25Z;Lex: ConocoPhillips;;"Being too rich can bring its own problems. With fuel costs rising and US motorists feeling mutinous, oil companies are under fire from all sides of the political spectrum. They must almost feel grateful for any temporary weakness in profits, or any scheme that boosts investment.ConocoPhillips stands out on both counts. Even the company itself now accepts that it paid a full price for Burlington Resources, not least in the light of the recent decline in natural gas prices. The $35bn deal will at least reduce its reliance on volatile refining profits, which suffered from a sharp decline in margins earlier in the year. Together with delays in restoring refineries hit by hurricanes, that led to a fall of almost 60 per cent in net income in its downstream business, compared with the fourth quarter.Recent improvements in capacity utilisation suggest a swift recovery, however, while oil exploration and production continue to benefit from high crude prices. Hence the emphasis on further investment, echoed by Exxon Mobil. Unfortunately, questions remain as to how easily ConocoPhillips can boost its own production. Most of the increases will come from raising its stake in Lukoil closer to 20 per cent, rather than organic growth.This is not to deny that, with its shares valued at seven times 2006 earnings before adjusting for Lukoil, ConocoPhillips would be a chief beneficiary of further increases in fossil fuel prices. With most of its existing production in comparatively low-taxed developed countries, that would produce a disproportionate boost in profits. However, investors could hardly expect to receive all those riches. One way or the other, policymakers may find ways to make oil companies and their shareholders share the pain, if oil prices continue to rise.- Click here to add your comments

666;COP;Conocophillips;2006-04-26T15:54:20Z;Conoco stresses investment as earnings rise 13%;;ConocoPhillips, the largest gas producer and third-largest oil company in the US, on Wednesday said it reinvested $4.7bn in refineries and development of new resources.The announcement, alongside the company’s first-quarter earnings, reflects industry-wide defensiveness in the face of public and political uproar over scale of oil-sector profits at a time when record fuel prices cut into consumer income.The reinvestment amounts to 141 per cent of the $3.3bn ConocoPhillips earned in net income during the third quarter, a 13.1 per cent increase over the previous year that includes $39 in charges. Earnings per share rose 14.1 per cent to $2.34, beating consensus analyst estimates on revenues that advanced 23.1 per cent to $47.9bn.Conoco released its earnings a day after President George W. Bush said oil companies should not get billions of dollars in tax breaks when they are making record profits. Last week, benchmark crude oil prices rose to a record of more than $75 per barrel.Conoco earned $2.6bn from oil and gas production, 43 per cent more than last year, producing the equivalent of 1.61m barrels of oil per day, the same level as a year ago.Mark Flannery, analyst at Credit Suisse, said Conoco’s US production volumes were better than expected, lagging international output volumes.Mr Flannery earlier this week raised his 2006 forecast for average Nymex WTI crude prices to $65, commenting that “demand growth has already decelerated, but the market appears to want something more dramatic to happen …a spike in prices then a collapse in demand- cannot be ruled out”.Conoco is the first among the top US oil producers to report results. ExxonMobil, the largest US oil group is due to report results on Thursday, while Chevron, the second-largest, will report on Friday.

By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent at 11.120.04, the S&P 500 lost 1 per cent to 1,295.50 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.9 per cent to 2,339.02.The broad-based sell-off capped a week of volatile trading that left the Dow and the S&P 0.1 per cent higher over the five sessions, and the Nasdaq almost unchanged.Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research, said the
wild intraday swings were due to a tug of war between bulls betting on a strong move higher as the earnings season gets underway on Monday, and bears who believed high interest rates and crude prices and record commodity prices would hurt earnings growth later in the year.“At the moment, I think the bulls have a slight edge over the bears,” he said, citing the absence of negative earnings pre-announcements as a cause for optimism.Energy, material and information technology were the top performing S&P industry groups this week. Shares of mining companies surged as metal prices such as copper and gold hit new highs. Copper producer Phelps Dodge advanced 4.3 per cent to $83.96, gold producer Newmont Miningadded 1.6 per cent to $52.74 and aluminium maker Alcoa jumped 6.3 per cent to $32.50.Energy stocks climbed alongside crude prices. The Amex Oil index rose 2.5 per cent, led by ConocoPhillips, up 4.4 per cent at $65.96.General Motors, which agreed to sell a controlling stake in GMAC, its finance arm, for $7.4bn this week, led the decliners on the Dow.It fell 8.3 per cent to $19.51 as sentiment was undermined by its ongoing dispute with Delphi and news that first-quarter sales fell by 14 per cent. Ford Motor, which reported lower sales, lost 4.5 per cent to $7.60.Merck weighed on the blue-chip index. Shares in the pharmaceutical group lost 2.2 per cent to $34.47 after it was ordered to pay at least $4.5m in compensation to a man who blamed Merck, the maker of Vioxx, for his heart attack.Analysts said the decision could potentially open the door for a new wave of litigation that could result in Merck paying billions of dollars in compensation.Supporting the Dow was 3M, which surged 7.1 per cent to $81.03 after raising its profit outlook for the first quarter. The Post-it Note maker said first-quarter revenue growth was expected to be as much as twice previous estimates while earnings could grow by up to 5.5 per cent.Technology stocks continued to make headway, with Apple Computer leading the way with a 11.3 per cent advance to $69.79.Apple shares soared after it unveiled new software allowing users to run Microsoft’s Windows operating system on its Intel-based Macintosh computers.Analysts said the move was likely to open the door to new Mac converts, although some warned that the gains would not be as swift and dramatic as some expected.“We would not expect any meaningful impact on Mac sales or earnings in the near or intermediate term,” said Rick Sherlund at Goldman Sachs.Google, up 4.1 per cent on the week to $406.16, saw its shares climb back above $400 for the first time since early February as index funds
continued to buy the stock following its inclusion in the S&P 500 index last week.Shares in Intercontinental Exchange, the electronic energy exchange, slumped 23.2 per cent this week to $53 after New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) announced plans to list its benchmark energy products on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the stock, saying the CME-Nymex team-up
“creates a potentially formidable combination that could alter the competitive landscape for the ICE”.“While we continue to believe in the ICE’s solid position in the energy derivatives market, the CME/Nymex partnership may limit further upside in the stock price,” said analyst Camron Ghaffari."
668;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;New issues: ConocoPhilips in $3bn deal;;ConocoPhillips, the US oil and gas group, sold $3bn of bonds on Thursday, replacing part of the bridge finance raised for its $36bn purchase of Burlington Resources, which closed last week.The issue comprised $1bn of one-year floating rate notes at three-month Libor, $1.25bn of three-year floaters at Libor plus 10 basis points, and another $750m in seven-year fixed-rate paper yielding 63bp over Treasuries.Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s assigned A- ratings, while Moody’s rated the issue A1. ConocoPhillips said it would have about $28bn of debt outstanding following the close of the Burlington deal.Citigroup, RBS Greenwich, Bank of America and Barclays Capital were joint bookrunners.Strong investor interest saw Viacom, the US media and entertainment group, sell $4.75bn of debt late on Wednesday. The issue was the third biggest in the US this year after offerings by technology groups Cisco Systems and Oracle.Viacom sold $1.5bn each in five and 10-year notes and $1.75bn in 30-year paper, with the issue increased in size from an expected $4bn. The extra bonds were all in the 30-year tranche, underscoring investor demand for long-dated assets.The three tranches, rated towards the low end of investment grade, were priced to yield 110 basis points, 147bp and 195bp respectively over Treasuries.Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan lead-managed the sale.In Europe Adecco, the Swiss recruitment group, set price guidance for its twin bond issue yesterday that aims to raise €700m to fund its acquisition of German rival Dis.The issue is split into a €150m-€200m two-year floating rate note, which is expected to price at 23-25 basis points over three-month Euribor, and a seven-year benchmark bond, worth €500m, which is expected to price at 67-70bp over mid-swaps.Final pricing for the issue is expected on Friday.The bonds, being sold by Goldman Sachs, SG CIB and UBS, will have a change of control clause allowing investors to sell them back to Adecco if its ratings are cut below investment grade due to a takeover.Adecco is currently rated at the lowest investment grade rung of Baa3/BBB-.
669;COP;Conocophillips;2006-04-03T21:02:21Z;Wall Street pares gains on rate worries;;Wall Street put in a mixed performance on Monday as lingering concerns over interest rates and General Motor’s falling sales combined to pull the market away from its intra-day high.Stocks initially rode on the wave of new merger and acquisition activity to surge ahead. But gains were pared as the persistence of high bond yields and stronger than expected construction spending figures weighed on sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3 per cent at 11,144.94, helped by Caterpillar’s 2.4 per cent advance on strong construction data. The broader S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,297.81, but the Nasdaq Composite reversed early gains to close down 0.1 per cent to 2,336.74.Retailers retreated after Wal-Mart’s March sales disappointed. Wal-Mart shares fell 1 per cent to $46.75 and rival Target lost 1.3 per cent to $51.34. Radioshack also slipped 4.2 per cent to $18.43 after Prudential downgraded the stock from “overweight” to “neutral”, saying said the consumer electronics retailer’s transition to selling Cingular products appeared to be more difficult than expected.Shares of mining companies surged however as prices for commodities such as copper and gold hit new highs. Copper producer Phelps Dodge advanced 4 per cent to $83.73, aluminum maker Alcoa gained 1.1 per cent to $30.90 and US Steel rose 2.5 per cent to $62.19.Energy stocks gained alongside crude prices. The Amex Oil index gained 0.4 per cent, led by ConocoPhillips, up 2 per cent at $64.41.Headlining the day’s deal activity was the eagerly awaited merger between telecom equipment makers Alcatel and Lucent. Lucent rose 1 per cent to $3.08 after news of the $13.4bn deal while the NYSE-listed shares of France’s Alcatel jumped 5.3 per cent to $16.21.General Motors, which agreed to sell a controlling stake in GMAC, its finance arm, for $7.4bn, was among the handful of blue-chip stocks trading lower.The stock fell 5.3 per cent to $20.14 as gains were pared by its ongoing dispute with its main parts supplier, Delphi and news that first-quarter sales fell by 14 per cent. Ford Motor, which also reported lower sales, was off 2.4 per cent at $7.77.Back on the deal front, Aztar, the Phoenix casino operator, rose 6.2 per cent to $44.60 after it received a $2.25bn, or $42 a share, acquisition proposal from Ameristar Casinos.The offer makes Ameristar, down 6.9 per cent at $24.01, the third bidder for Aztar, following offers from Pinnacle Entertainment and Colony Capital.News that Service, the biggest US owner of funeral homes and cemeteries, had agreed to buy Alderwoods, the industry’s number two, for $856m helped drive up shares in both companies. Service shot up 9.1 per cent to $8.51 and Alderwoods rose 8.1 per cent to $19.34.Elsewhere, a bullish article in the financial weekly Barron’s helped push Microsoft up 1 per cent to $27.49.Verizon and Motorola, rose 1.1 per cent to $34.42 and 1.9 per cent to $23.35, respectively, after each announced plans to sell off some of their assets.
670;COP;Conocophillips;2006-03-28T21:23:46Z;‘Hawkish’ Fed deals a blow to equity investors;;Stocks on Wall Street lost ground on Tuesday as a statement from the Federal Reserve dealt a blow to investors hoping for a quick end to the current US interest rate rising cycle.The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points and warned that further policy firming might be needed to keep inflationary pressures under control.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the statement was “fairly hawkish” and speculated that the Fed would raise interest rates by another quarter point at their next meeting. “The Fed has really left the door open going forward. It certainly appeared that they want the market to discount another 25 basis points and possibly more depending on the data.”The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 1,293.22 by the close, with interest-rate sensitive banking stocks weighing on the index. JPMorgan Chase lost 1.3 per cent to $41.56, Bank of America slipped 1.6 per cent to $46.06 and Wells Fargo fell 1.3 per cent to $64.06.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.5 per cent lower at 2,304.46, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9 per cent to 11,154.54.Eli Lilly suffered as sentiment turned negative towards the Indianapolis drugmaker. Its shares, which had risen almost 4 per cent on the year before yesterday, fell 3.9 per cent to $56.38 as Friedman Billings Ramsey lowered its recommendation on the stock from “market perform” to “underperform”.David Moskowitz, an analyst at Friedman, said the business continued to be pressured by a lacklustre product pipeline and new competition in the diabetes and depression markets. “In our view, slowing growth trends do not support Lilly’s premium valuation,” he said.Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation, downgrading the drugmaker from “buy” to “neutral”, saying its antidepressant Cymbalta was struggling to gain prescription share in spite of its promotional efforts.There were some bright spots elsewhere in the drugs sector, with Immunicon climbing 12.7 per cent to $4.07 after announcing the extension of a research and development agreement with drugs giant Pfizer.Howvever, Pfizer eased 1.5 per cent to $25.42 on news that it was being sued by an employee insurance fund over allegations it defrauded the US government healthcare programme by marketing its Lipitor drug to a larger range of patients than federal rules allowed.General Motors fell 0.8 per cent to $22.75 after announcing job cuts aimed at kick-starting efforts to cut its US white-collar workforce by 7 per cent this year.Higher crude prices helped oil producer ConocoPhillips up 1 per cent to $63.75. Oil service stocks also made broad advances. Schlumberger traded 1.3 per cent higher at $124.58 while Halliburton added 2.2 per cent to $73.18.Lennar, the third largest housebuilder in the US, rose 1.2 per cent to $61.03 after announcing a jump in quarterly profitBy contrast, Lexar Media, the flash-memory chipmaker, which is in the process of being acquired by Micron, fell 6.6 per cent to $8.71 after it lowered its first quarter sales guidance.
671;COP;Conocophillips;2006-03-27T22:03:13Z;Oil sector mergers hit $160bn last year;;"Mergers and acquisitions in the oil and gas industry tripled in value last year to $160bn - the highest level since the boom year of 1998 when Exxon and Mobil merged, BP took over Amoco, and Total bought PetroFina.Deals by Chinese oil and natural gas companies, meanwhile, are expected to have grown sixfold to $6bn in 2005 as they became big international players, buying assets from Ecuador to Sudan and Syria, according to an authoritative industry study.The report, released tomorrow, suggests oil industry executives and government leaders have been on a frantic global buying spree, under rising pressure to secure the oil and gas needed to fuel economic expansion.The study by Harrison Lovegrove, the UK-based corporate advisers, and John S Herold, the US research firm, is widely regarded by the industry as the most comprehensive report on M&A activity in the sector. It is expected to show that last year oil companies were willing to pay 54 per cent more for acquisitions in North America as executives bet that high oil prices were here to stay. Acquisition prices in the rest of the world shot up 350 per cent.Excluding the former Soviet Union, prices outside North America jumped 155 per cent. But the highest prices were attracted by Canada because of its political stability and favourable tax environment.The report found that more than 240 deals had been struck worldwide, a 40 per cent jump from the preceding year. Much of the activity was among publicly traded companies. It included Chevron?s $20bn purchase of Unocal and ConocoPhillips?s acquisition of Burlington Resources for $36bn.The companies being snapped up were mainly mid-sized ? too big for modest drilling successes to deliver good growth results but not large enough to compete with national oil companies or to venture into tough new terrain.National oil companies also had busy mergers and acquisition programmes.Deals by state-controlled companies totalled $30bn, three times up on 2004.Moscow?s consolidation of its power over Russia?s energy interests involved its purchase of a
10 per cent stake in Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly, and Gazprom?s $13bn acquisition of Sibneft, among others. The
value of the deals totalled about $20bn.Despite last year?s boom, executives of the biggest oil groups continue to argue publicly that potential acquisitions are currently too expensive. And behind the scenes, regulatory hurdles have been sharpened by the political backlash over the industry?s record earnings.At least one big oil company has said it will be on the prowl for takeover targets once oil prices drop to about $45 a barrel. This price fall, it is hoped, will remove the gloss of high revenues to reveal those companies struggling to keep costs in check and unable to grow."
672;COP;Conocophillips;2006-03-24T21:56:14Z;Rates prospects give stocks impetus;;The prospect of US interest rates peaking sooner than expected provided stocks on Wall Street with a boost on Friday.A government report showing that sales of new homes in February recorded their biggest drop in nine years helped equities rally as investors reasoned that the Federal Reserve might take a less hawkish view on interest rates.The news came at the end of a mixed week on Wall Street in which stocks failed to extend their recent bull run as any advances in the main indices were pegged back by ongoing rate concerns.This was in spite of continuing good news on the corporate earnings front, with profits from both Nike, up 0.6 per cent to $85.96, and Morgan Stanley, 2 per cent higher at $61.47, beating analysts’ expectations.Better-than-forecast quarterly profits and guidance sent shares in contract electronics maker Jabil Circuit up 12.5 per cent to a five-year high of $42.72.“The market wants to put interest rates on the back burner,” said Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “On days when we can avoid looking at them, the market forges ahead.”It was hard for investors to avoid the subject during a week in which Ben Bernanke gave his first big speech as Fed chairman and seemed to quell hopes for a quick halt to the current US rate-tightening cycle.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 11,279.97, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,302.96 while the Nasdaq put in the best performance of the three main indices, rising 0.6 per cent to 2,312.82, helped by a sparkling performance from internet search company Google.Over the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent and the S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent.Investors had their eyes on energy stocks, which rose and fell in response to falling and rising crude prices.The Amex oil index ended the week 0.6 per cent lower, although Marathon Oil rose 1.2 per cent to $77.30 and ConocoPhillips added 0.7 per cent to $61.76 after being upgraded by Prudential Equity Group.General Motors rose 7.2 per cent to $22.65 as the ailing carmaker announced cost-saving deals with the United Auto Workers union and carparts supplier Delphi, and sold a majority stake in its property-finance arm, GMAC Commercial Holding, in a deal valued at $9bn.Shares in Wal-Mart gained 3.2 per cent to $48.19, hitting their highest level this year amid reports that the retailer was set to announce a significant expansion of its Chinese operations.Bristol Myers Squibb advanced after the company settled a patent dispute with a Canadian drugmaker over its Plavix blood-thinning treatment.The deal prompted a flurry of broker upgrades and helped the stock climb 11.3 per cent to $25.52.Technology stocks hit a rough patch this week after Microsoft announced late on Tuesday that the finished consumer version of its Vista operating system would not be available until next year. Although the latest hold-up represents only a small setback after two years of delays, the move dealt a potentially damaging blow to sales of PC makers during the crucial holiday shopping season.Microsoft ended the week 1.8 per cent lower at $27.01 while shares in computer makers Gateway and Hewlett-Packard fell 1.7 per cent to $2.38 and 2.9 per cent to $33.17 respectively.Dell, which said on Tuesday it expected sales growth to outpace the wider market as a result of expansion in Asia, bucked the falling trend. Its shares rose 3.4 per cent to $30.06 on the week.Google shares also made progress, rallying 7.7 per cent to $365.80 after Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, said it would add the internet search group to its benchmark S&P 500 index.Demand for Google surged as fund managers whose strategies rely on tracking the benchmark index rushed to add the stock to their portfolios.Elsewhere in the sector, Yahoo gained 5.7 per cent to $31.77 after UBS upgraded the stock on valuation grounds.Lucent Technology rose 5.5 per cent to $3.06 on the week after the telecommunications equipment maker confirmed that it was in merger talks with Alcatel, of France.
673;COP;Conocophillips;2006-03-23T21:57:08Z;Wall Street can’t shake rate concerns;;Energy stocks raced ahead on Wall Street on Thursday but the broader market was knocked off course by surprisingly strong housing sales figures.The figures rekindled the debate about how much further US interest rates would rise. Existing home sales rose 5.2 per cent in February to 6.91m units, well above the consensus of 6.5m units.Industrial blue-chips, healthcare, financials and technology stocks succumbed to profit-taking as investors locked in gains from this week.A rebound in crude prices hit market sentiment. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent at 11,270.29. The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 1,301.67 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.1 per cent at 2,300.15.Homebuilders gained on the strong housing data, while oil service stocks were lifted by higher energy prices. Energy producers moved higher after Prudential Equity Group upgraded Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips as part of a review of the sector.Marathon climbed 1.1 per cent to $77.11 and Conoco rose 1.1 per cent to $61.12.Internet portal Yahoo was among the few rising stocks in the technology sector. Its shares jumped 3.5 per cent to $31.83 after UBS upgraded it from “neutral” to “buy” on valuation grounds.Adobe Systems, the computer software maker, slid 0.8 per cent to $36.33 after it warned that sales this quarter would be between $640m to $670m, short of the market expectations.PC makers were still under pressure after Microsoft’s decision on Tuesday to delay the launch of its new operating system. Microsoft, which lost more than 2 per cent on Wednesday, shed 1.1 per cent to $26.85. Dell, which bought gaming-computer maker Alienware for an undisclosed sum, failed to buck the falling trend, easing 0.2 per cent to $30.34.The news lifted shares in chipmaker Advanced Micro Devicesto climb 1.1 per cent to $34.75 after JPMorgan analysts said the Dell deal could spur sales.YRC Worldwide, the largest trucking company in the US, led the decline among transport stocks. Its shares skidded 14.9 per cent to $38.56 after it slashed its first-quarter guidance.The earnings reporting season for food makers had a good start with General Mills rising 0.5 per cent to $50.23 after it topped analyst estimates with a 7 per cent rise in third-quarter profits.Rival ConAgra rose 1.4 per cent to $20.54 despite a swing into third-quarter losses due to restructuring and litigation charges. Analysts said that without the one-off costs, the company had beaten expectations.Better than expected quarterly profit and earnings guidance sent shares in Jabil Circuit, a contract electronics maker, to a five-year high of $42.75, up 11.8 per cent.General Motors, which sold a majority stake in its financing arm GMAC Commerical Holding in a deal valued at $9bn, ended a choppy session almost unchanged at $22.00.
674;COP;Conocophillips;2006-02-24T21:55:52Z;Oil and poor data rein in Wall Street’s gains;;Wall Street ended a volatile week with a mixed performance on Friday as rising crude prices and continuing concerns about US interest rates reined in gains seen earlier in the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent at 11,061.85 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to 2,287.04. The S&P 500, helped by sharp gains in energy stocks, rose 0.1 per cent to 1,289.43.The session capped a choppy week of trading, which saw the Dow lose 0.5 per cent and both the S&P and the Nasdaq edge up 0.2 per cent.Differing inflation readings and volatile crude prices were responsible for the market’s swings.Shares fell on Tuesday after the Conference Board’s leading indicators rose for the fourth successive month, suggesting robust economic growth. However, stocks moved higher the next trading day after benign core inflation data gave hope that the Federal Reserve was almost done with its cycle of monetary tightening.But stocks fell again on Thursday after a drop in jobless claims raised fears of wage-pushed inflation. And on Friday shares put in a mixed performance amid data showing that a decline in aircraft orders at Boeing helped push new orders for US made durable goods down 10.2 per cent in January, the biggest drop in five-and-a-half years.In spite of diverging economic data, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said most of the figures that came in this week pointed to a strong economy.The week’s trade, he said, was marked by the conflict over whether strong growth is good or bad for stocks. “Most felt that the Fed should be done tightening but the reality is that the economy is too strong for the Fed to quit,” he added.The two biggest US retailers reported fourth-quarter results early in the week, but it was Friday’s earnings miss by Gap which sealed the fate of the sector. The clothing company reported its first annual fall in profit in four years, forcing it to lower its guidance for the current year as it lost customers to rivals like Abercrombie & Fitch. Gap fell 2.1 per cent to $18.43, while Abercrombie, which reported last week, eased 0.5 per cent to $64.92.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, reported on Tuesday, and although it beat forecasts, the company’s statement on its outlook failed to match expectations. Its shares were down 1.4 per cent on the week to $45.45.Fellow Dow constituent Home Depot was down 0.5 per cent to $41.63, in spite of revealing a better-than-expected 30 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings. Meanwhile, Federated Department Stores failed to impress with its fourth-quarter net-profit increase and fell 1.6 per cent to $70.45.Volatile oil prices caused some uncertainty with energy stocks early in the week but Friday’s explosion at a Saudi Arabian facility and further concerns over Nigerian exports helped crude prices and oil companies higher.Sunoco was on Friday upgraded to “outperform” from “peer perform” by Bear Stearns as the broker expected strengthening refining margins. Its shares were up 2.3 per cent on Friday, but only 1.1 per cent on the week to $77.96.The top weekly gainers in the sector were ConocoPhillips, up 1.3 per cent to $62.73, and Valero Energy gained 3.1 per cent to $56.19.Among other movers, H&R Block, the biggest US tax advisory service, lost 9.1 per cent on the week to $23.01 after saying on Friday it had underestimated its own income tax rate, leaving it owing a further $32m and forcing it to restate its accounts for the second time in six months.Shares of Dana fell to their lowest level in three decades amid mounting concerns about the financial health of the autoparts supplier. Its shares ended the week 64.3 per cent lower at $1.51 after ratings downgrades by Moody’s and S&P sent the group deeper into junk status.It was closely followed by Sherwin-Williams, which slumped 21.6 per cent this week to $41.29 after analysts said the paint maker could face millions of dollars in clean-up costs for homes tainted with lead paint following a jury ruling.News that British utility National Grid was in talks to acquire Keyspan for $7.3bn drove up the shares of the biggest natural gas seller in the US 2.5 per cent this week to $41.41.Following the earnings driven gains of last week for Hewlett-Packard, profit taking hit the stock, dragging its shares 6 per cent lower this week to $32.02.
675;COP;Conocophillips;2006-02-22T21:29:50Z;Wall St higher as core inflation remains benign;;Wall Street moved higher yesterday as interest-rate fears eased after core inflation remained relatively tame, while crude oil prices pulled back amid expectations of further US stockbuilding.Excluding volatile food and energy costs, consumer prices in January were up just 0.2 per cent. Headline inflation rose an unexpectedly large 0.7 per cent, reflecting higher energy costs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the session 0.6 per cent higher at 11,137.17, while the S&P 500 added 0.8 per cent to 1,292.67 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9 per cent to 2,283.17.CenturyTel was one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 after it announced on Tuesday a $1bn share buyback programme to run over two years. The shares added 4.5 per cent to $36.39.“The buyback equates to 100 per cent of free cash flow over the next two years, which we believe is above consensus for return of capital and should cause shares to approach our $40 price target,” said John Hodulik at UBS.Among the most active stocks traded on the Dow, drugmaker Pfizer gained 2.2 per cent to $26.19. Late on Tuesday a preliminary injunction was granted to prevent India’s Ranbaxy from marketing a generic version of Pfizer’s top-selling Lipitor.Oil prices fell for the first day in four as expectations of higher US inventories today overshadowed geo­political concerns. Lehman Brothers cut its average forecast on crude oil in 2006 to $59.99 a barrel from $65.Energy stocks were hit, and Sunoco fell 3.2 per cent to $75.01, Valero Energy shed 1.8 per cent to $54.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 1.5 per cent to $61.90.But among the stocks to benefit from lower oil prices, US Airways gained 3.5 per cent to $33.64, helped also by broker Bear Stearns, which upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “peer perform”. Continental Airlines added 3.8 per cent to $22.88.Baidu.com, the Nasdaq-listed Chinese internet search engine, reported that fourth-quarter net profit almost quadrupled. The company said it expected first-quarter sales to triple on continued advertising growth and growth in internet subscriptions in China. The shares jumped 5.9 per cent to $54.73.Taser International, the stungun-maker, fell 1.9 per cent to $10.20 after it reported a 98 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings due to rising legal costs and falling sales amid a probe into the safety of its products.Sprint Nextel, the country’s third-largest wireless operator, was down 4.5 per cent to $23.80 after fourth-quarter net profit fell nearly 55 per cent due to acquisition costs.Harrah’s Entertainment, the world’s biggest casino operator, was up 0.5 per cent at $72.72 after it unveiled fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations.
676;COP;Conocophillips;2006-02-22T13:25:14Z;Agreement reached on Alaskan gasline project;;A long-debated $20bn pipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska to the rest of the US on Wednesday will take a big step towards becoming reality as state lawmakers begin hearings to approve a deal signed on Tuesday between the state’s governor and three of the world’s biggest energy groups.ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, of the US, and the London-based BP, reached the agreement after Governor Frank Murkowski agreed the companies pay 20 per cent, rather than 25 per cent tax on the pipeline’s profits.BP expects the pipeline to take ten years to build once legislators approve the proposal. But the company on Wednesday warned this could only happen if Alaskan legislators made no amendments to the conditions agreed with the governor. Alsaka’s House Resources Committee is due to begin hearings on Wednesday.Richard Owen, vice-president of ExxonMobil Alaska Production, said: “Oil contract terms consistent with the governor’s proposed tax bill would provide the predictability and durability necessary to advance the gas project to the next phase.”For almost forty years Alaska has transported, via pipeline and tanker, oil to the US West Coast and beyond, but has been unable to bring to market its 35 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.But in the past decade the natural gas fields in the lower 48 states on which US consumers have relied to power their lights and heat their homes have begun to age and produce lower and lower volumes of gas. Prices have spiked to record highs and the US has become increasingly reliant on foreign cargoes of liquefied natural gas.Securing enough oil and gas to ensure the US economy continues to grow and America limits – as much as it is possible – its reliance on unstable foreign regions such as the Middle East, has become a hot topic of debate in Washington of late. In October, the US Congress passed a law giving $18bn in federal loan guarantees to the pipeline project.For Alaska, which has no income tax and gets more than 80 per cent of its revenue from taxes and royalties associated with oil and natural gas production, the pipeline would secure income for many years to come.This is particularly important at a time when Alaska’s oil production is beginning to slow as its fields age. In addition to the pipeline deal, Mr Murkowski this week proposed a change in the state’s tax laws that would allow Juneau to capture more of the profit from high oil prices.“Alaskans deserves a fair share of revenues from our oil wealth – particularly at this time of higher oil prices. With the producers seeking greater fiscal stability in return for a commitment to move forward on a natural gas pipeline, this is the most appropriate time to reform our ineffective and inadequate tax system,” Mr Murkowski said
677;COP;Conocophillips;2006-02-21T22:36:40Z;Wall Street falls on US interest-rate concerns;;Wall Street fell on Tuesday as strong results from the retail sector, rising oil prices and better-than-forecast economic data fuelled inflationary fears and expectations of more aggressive interest rate increases.By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent at 11,069.06, while the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent lower at 1,283.03 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.9 per cent at 2,262.49.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, fell 1.1 per cent to $45.74 in spite of a forecast-beating 13.4 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings as its outlook statement fell shy of expectations.Fellow Dow constituent Home Depot was little changed at $41.87 after it also unveiled better-than-expected results that included a 30 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, boosted by revenue growth across all divisions.Meanwhile, RadioShack, the troubled electronics retailer, reversed early gains and fell 0.4 per cent to $19 after a 62 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings. Some strategists felt there was value in the stock, however, following the resignation of David Edmondson, chief executive.“We believe there is so much bad news priced in at this point, that disappointing near-term results will be discounted in anticipation of improvements from new management,” said David Strasser, at Bank of America, upgrading the stock from “sell” to “neutral”.Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said its acquisition of May Department Stores in August had helped drive a 59 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net profit, while a tax settlement also helped boost earnings. The results, however, fell a little short of expectations and the shares fell 1.7 per cent to $70.40.Following the earnings-driven gains of last week for Hewlett-Packard, profit taking hit the stock and the computer hardware sector. HP shares were down 4.6 per cent to $32.51, while sector peers Dell and Apple fell 1.9 per cent to $29.81 and 1.7 per cent to $69.08 respectively.This weakness permeated the wider technology sector. Texas Instruments, the chipmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to $30.65, while rival Broadcom slid 2.8 per cent to $65.99 and Applied Materials lost 2.2 per cent to $19.29.Carnival, the cruise operator, was down 3.2 per cent to $51.83 after Credit Suisse cut its rating to “neutral” from “outperform” as it expected weaker-than-forecast peak season bookings and higher promotional costs.Oil stocks were among the biggest gainers after a rise in crude prices. Among them, ConocoPhillips added 2.9 per cent to $62.83 while Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group, climbed 6.3 per cent to $72.85.On the data front, the Conference Board’s leading indicators, an index of 10 components including jobless claims and factory orders, rose for the fourth-successive month, suggesting robust economic growth.

The results beat forecasts and the company said revenue would increase in 2006 in spite of declining business at General Motors, its biggest customer.“Our bias remains positive, we believe the stock can perform well in the near-term thanks to improved bookings,” said Gregory Gould at Goldman Sachs. In spite of sounding a note of caution over the GM business, the stock gained 0.8 per cent to $25.71.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, gained 8.5 per cent to $52.96 after strong Christmas sales extended into January and prompted it to raise its fourth-quarter and annual earnings forecasts.Marriott International, the hotels operator, reported that fourth-quarter net profit surged 25 per cent on rising revenue per room as business travel in the US and Asia picked up. Shares added 2.3 per cent to $67.64.Semiconductor stocks responded to a note by Merrill Lynch trumpeting the resurgence in the WLAN [wireless local area network] semiconductor market.“We expect the WiFi market to grow 18 per cent annually over the next three years, driven by growth in games consoles, digital cameras and cell phones,” Merrill said. Marvell Technology Group, named by Merrill as the leader in the WLAN market, was up 1.5 per cent to $68.75, while Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, added 1.6 per cent to $21.Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world’s largest supplier of soft drinks, was up 3.2 per cent to $20.09 as it reported a fourth-quarter net loss after expenses. Excluding costs associated with repatriating earnings and restructuring, however, the company would have beaten market expectations.AIG, the world’s biggest insurer, was reported to have agreed a $1.6bn fraud settlement after allegations it had used bogus reinsurance contracts to cover up losses. Shares gained 1.1 per cent to $67.12.Health insurer Aetna gained 3.3 per cent to $99.27 as it reported a 41 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profit, beating forecasts, on strong customer growth.The company upwardly revised its membership growth forecasts for 2006.But oil companies cast a cloud over the market after crude prices remained below $63 a barrel after a burgeoning rally petered out.ConocoPhillips fell 1.5 per cent to $59.30, while Chevron lost 1.7 per cent to $56.90.
679;COP;Conocophillips;2006-01-25T22:36:03Z;Homes data sap Wall Street confidence;;Wall Street was spooked on Wednesday by the release of very weak existing home sales data.This overshadowed a healthier tone to the quarterly earnings season and a burst of merger and acquisition activity.Support came from a fresh decline in oil prices after weekly figures showed an unexpectedly large increase in US gasoline and distillate stocks. Benchmark US crude futures fell below the $66 a barrel mark, just two days after touching a four-month high above $69.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a fraction lower while both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.2 per cent.The market got an early boost from forecast-beating results from ConocoPhillips and Colgate-Palmolive, with news of Walt Disney’s acquisition of Pixar providing further cheer.Asian markets were generally higher, although Tokyo missed out as investors worried the resumption of trading in Livedoor shares could overload the stock exchange’s trading system. The Nikkei 225 ended flat, but Seoul and Taipei each rose 1.2 per cent.In Europe, evidence that Germany’s economic recovery was gathering momentum helped lift share prices. The Ifo institute’s index of German business sentiment reached its best level for nearly 6 years The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1.1 per cent and the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt leapt 1.7 per cent.“Little seems to stop the upswing in the German economy for now,” said Rainer Guntermann, eurozone economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.“The European Central Bank is likely to use the improved growth outlook to continue its campaign of interest rate normalisation.“While a rate hike next week still looks a bit premature, given the lack of sufficient verbal preparation, the ECB may use the upcoming press conference to drop some concerns about near-term downside risks to growth and to increase its vigilance on inflation risks.“The next 25 basis point rate hike in the not-too-distant future – probably in March – seems to be shaping up.”The dollar recouped an initial decline against the euro as the currency markets shrugged off the Ifo survey findings.Meanwhile, any lingering expectations that UK rates might be cut in the near-term were dealt a blow by stronger than forecast fourth quarter gross domestic product data and the Monetary Policy Committee’s latest minutes.“With GDP growth picking up to 0.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter – close to trend growth – as a significant pick up in service sector activity countered further contraction in industrial output, and Stephen Nickell remaining the only MPC member in favour of lower interest rates in January, the chances of a February interest rate cut have receded further,” said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at Global Insight.Michael Taylor at Lombard Street Research pointed out that the strength of the Ifo survey also boded well for the outlook for the UK.“With Germany accounting for around one-third of eurozone output, a strong recovery there will underpin overall Eurozone growth,” he said. “Of course this is good news for the UK manufacturing sector which is heavily dependent on exports to the eurozone.”Metals prices had another strong day, with copper, zinc and platinum all reaching record highs. Gold came within a whisker of setting a new 25-year peak and silver touched its best level for nearly 19 years.
680;COP;Conocophillips;2006-01-25T22:12:03Z;Wall Street worried by housing weakness;;Concerns over the health of the US housing market weighed on Wall Street on Wednesday, offsetting modest early gains.News of a third consecutive month of falling sales of existing homes underlined concerns that the housing market has slowed, which could undermine consumer confidence and hurt the US economy.Those fears wiped an early gain of 50 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended off a fraction at 10,709.74.“The rally was derailed by poor housing data. It was much weaker than expected,” said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent to 1,264.68 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2 per cent to 2,260.65. The falls ended two days of modest gains.Energy stocks also fell sharply as the oil price weakened. ConocoPhillips lost 1.5 per cent to $63.54 in spite of surging fourth-quarter profits.All this took attention away from a couple of juicy takeovers.The battle for medical devices maker Guidant would appear to have been won by Boston Scientific as the pair agreed a deal worth $27bn. This meant defeat for Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group that was also in the running.Shares in Guidant and Boston fell 2.1 per cent to $75.19 and 1.9 per cent to $23.54 respectively as the two-month battle ended. J&J slipped 1.4 per cent to $58.50 even though its loss was sweetened by the prospect of $705m from Guidant for breaking an earlier deal.Talk turned to whether J&J would pursue alternative targets, with St Jude Medical and ImClone the names in the frame.St Jude, which reported disappointing sales figures, fell 6.1 per cent to $50.03 and ImClone lost 2.5 per cent to $34.49.Investors also got a first chance to react to Tuesday’s late news that Walt Disney is to pay $7.4bn for Pixar, the studio behind the Toy Story films.Merrill Lynch was among those to welcome the deal. Analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said: “We view the Disney-Pixar combination as a near perfect strategic fit. Pixar’s family-oriented content meshes well with Disney’s brand.” Pixar rose 0.8 per cent to $58.02 and Disney fell 2.1 per cent to $25.44.Pharmaceutical group Bristol Myers Squibb rose 3 per cent to $21.97 in spite of news that its 2006 result would likely to be lower than expected. The company is fighting off generic treats to Pravachol, its cholesterol drug.McDonalds fell 1.9 per cent at $35.16 as shareholder activist Bill Ackman dropped his campaign for restructuring at the fast food group, a day after it reported a jump in earnings.CBRL Group, another restaurant operator, surged 22.1 per cent to $43.36 on news of a review that it is hoped will boost shareholder value.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
682;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConocoPhillips cashes in with 51% rise in profits;;ConocoPhillips, the US’ third largest oil and gas company, on Wednesday reported a 51 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profit, cashing in on the high commodity prices that have rankled with the public as it struggles with ever-increasing fuel bills.While the US’ first- and second-biggest energy groups sought to head off another round of the criticism that marked the release of their massive third-quarter profits with media briefings and information sheets, Conoco, which was the first of the big three to report, simply released its financial results.They are sure again to become the focus of politicians - some of whom sought to tax the oil and gas companies following the companies’ third-quarter financial results. While the complaints will not reach a fever pitch until next week when ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly listed oil and gas group, reports its earnings, Conoco’s huge gains set the stage.The company reported fourth-quarter net profit of $3.68bn, or $2.61 per share, up from $2.43bn, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier. Conoco said its gains, which came on $52.2bn in revenue, up from $40.1bn, were partly offset by the effects of last year’s hurricanes, which have kept one of its refineries shut.Conoco shares, initially higher, were off 1.7 per cent at $63.39 at midday in New York.For the full 2005 year, Conoco reported net income of $13.5bn, or $9.55 per share, up from $8.1bn, or $5.80 per share, the previous year. Total revenue was $183.4bn, up from $136.9bn a year ago.Conoco has positioned itself to capitalise on the surge in energy prices by recent acquisitions in refining and marketing, as well as the exploration and production, segments.While it was criticised for moving into refining and marketing several years before the boom, the company is now reaping the benefits. It is now making a bet on the US natural gas market, with the purchase of Burlington Resources, expected to be completed this year. The company has also resumed its business relationship with Libya, which it expects to yield increased reserves and production.While Conoco’s production remained essentially flat, its financial gains enabled it to end the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 19 per cent, down from 21 per cent at the end of the third quarter.During the fourth quarter, Conoco generated $4.7bn in cash, spent $3bn on capital projects and investments, paid $429m in dividends, reduced debt by $981m and repurchased $759m of its stock. For the year, it spent $11.6bn on capital expenditures and investments – an 86 per cent reinvestment of 2005 net income.
683;COP;Conocophillips;2006-01-18T21:44:31Z;Wall Street sees red as technology stocks suffer;;Wall Street’s new year rally hit another snag on Wednesday after disappointing earnings from technology heavyweights Intel and Yahoo sparked a new bout of selling.The Nasdaq Composite index, which gets almost half of its value from technology shares, bore the blunt of the retreat, closing 1 per cent lower at 2,279.64.Concerns about the fourth-quarter earnings season also affected the other two leading indices, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing 0.4 per cent lower at 10,854.86 0.4 per cent and the S&P 500 also down 0.4 per cent at 1,277.93.Intel, the chipmaker, was the session’s worst performer, tumbling 11.5 per cent to $22.60 after it said the outlook for first-quarter sales would be lower than expected.Investment banks Citigroup, Piper Jaffray and UBS all cut their ratings on the stock, with the latter citing profits concerns for fiscal 2006.“Intel’s guidance indicates that it is willing to give up pricing and thus margins to regain market share,” said UBS in a research note. “We do not expect Intel to be able to grow revenue or earnings at double-digit rates in 2006.”Yahoo, the internet portal, fared little better, skidding 12.3 per cent to $35.18 after it unveiled earnings that fell marginally short of market expectations.The group further dented investor sentiment after it indicated that profit margins would slip this year as a result of higher investment spending.Negative sentiment about the sector also dragged down shares in Apple Computer and Google – both of which have helped lead the rally in technology stocks this year.Apple slid 2.6 per cent to $82.49 ahead of its own quarterly results, due after the close, while Google lost 4.8 per cent, or $22.20, to $444.90.Other sector decliners included Ebay, down 2.1 per cent at $44.44 and Dell Computer, down 1.4 per cent at 29.97.IBM was among the few to buck the downward trend. Shares in the computer maker gained 1 per cent to $83.80 after reporting an 13 per cent jump in fourth quarter profits.Losses on the main indices were compounded by a sharp pullback in energy stocks, which skidded following an easing in crude prices.The Amex oil index lost 1.5 per cent, led by ExxonMobil’s 1.4 per cent decline. Rival Chevron fell 1.6 per cent to $60.90, as did ConocoPhillips, which fell 1.4 per cent to $63.41.Energy sensitive stocks such as airlines and transportation companies rallied however.The Amex airline index surged 4.5 per cent, with low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines pacing the gains. Shares in Southwest jumped 5.6 per cent to $16.76 following a 54 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings.By contrast, JPMorgan Chase, which reported a 62 per cent jump in quarterly profit, fell 1.1 per cent to $39.28 on profit taking.
684;COP;Conocophillips;2006-01-12T07:25:31Z;Australia and E Timor reach oil and gas deal;;Australia and East Timor have agreed to equally share oil and gas revenues from the Timor Sea in a deal that may restart the stalled Greater Sunrise gas project.The deal could potentially deliver up to A$14.5bn (US$10.9) to East Timor over 20 years, said Alexander Downer, Australian foreign minister, after the agreement was signed in Sydney on Thursday.However Woodside Petroleum, the Australian energy company which holds a 34.4 per cent stake in the development, and is expected to be its operator, said that the development of Greater Sunrise remained on hold due to a lack of certainty.Chief executive Don Voelte told Financial Times this week that he would only reconsider restarting the project, expected to cost A$6.6bn, once the agreement had been ratified by lawmakers in the two nations and then only if the development was considered to be as commercially promising as Woodside?s other gas projects.?Sunrise has lost valuable years,? he said.Gordon Ramsay, an energy analyst at UBS in Sydney, said while Greater Sunrise was once one of the most advanced projects for Woodside, the Perth-based company was ?now clearly focused on other gas projects?.The agreement between the two nations was concluded last month in Darwin after eight rounds of often-heated negotiations over maritime boundaries and revenue sharing.Australia had initially said it was entitled to 80 per cent of royalties from the Greater Sunrise project as four-fifths of the deposits, which are estimated to be worth around A$40bn, lay in the seabed under Australian sovereignty.John Howard, prime minister, said the revised arrangement was ?a fair and just outcome,? and ?[it] will make a very, very important contribution,?Mari Alkatiri, East Timor?s prime minister, said ?I am quite confident my parliament will ratify the treaty after some tough questions because it is good for the people of East Timor.?The two nations also agreed to put maritime boundary and jurisdictional claims on hold for fifty years.East Timor is already entitled to 90 per cent of revenues from the development of the Bayu-Undan field in located in the Timor Gap.The Greater Sunrise field is estimated to contain around 8,000m cubic feet of gas and about 300m barrels of condensate.Its partners - Royal Dutch/ Shell, Osaka Gas and ConocoPhillips - had already spent A$250m on the project before it was put on hold in November 2004.Woodside said a decision on the location of a liquefied natural gas processing plant had yet to be resolved. While East Timor has wanted the plant to be built on its soil, Woodside has preferred Wickham Point in northern Australia, where a plant is being built for ConocoPhillip?s Bayu-Undan project.
685;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-19T19:36:58Z;Lex: Upstream oil;;"In a big bad world, we all sometimes yearn for home comforts. Oil companies are no different. ConocoPhillips’ recent purchase of Burlington Resources is a prominent example of a Western major getting back to where it all started: the US onshore oil and gas industry.Oil majors are flush with cash and access to the best international reserves is tricky. Meanwhile, the US remains a low-tax region with good infrastructure and a tightening squeeze on domestic energy supply. Lower taxes and operating costs, and higher realised prices, mean greater leverage when crude is expensive. John S Herold, a consultancy, reckons US net income per barrel of oil equivalent of production has increased from around $8 to $11 between 2000 and 2004. European profits, at around $7/boe have barely moved.Such sensitivity cuts both ways, of course and these numbers only tell half the story. What really matters is return on capital. Mature provinces with smaller fields, such as the US, demand more investment per barrel. Measured across 2000-04, post-tax return on capital in the US upstream sector has lagged behind Europe and the global average.As more companies pile back into their old haunts, the resulting cost inflation will also erode the advantage in unit profitability. A returns-focused approach to investment has served the super-majors well over the past few decades. In buying Burlington, ConocoPhillips is betting heavily on commodity prices, particularly natural gas, and has firmly pitched its tent in the industry’s opportunistic camp.- Click here to add your comments

686;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-13T21:23:23Z;ConocoPhillips defends Burlington deal;;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group, was on Tuesday forced to defend the logic and timing of its $35.6bn acquisition of Burlington Resources, as many analysts expressed disappointment with the deal and Conoco shares fell for a second consecutive day.On a conference call with analysts following the signing of the merger, James Mulva, Conoco chief executive, was asked to explain why his company was spending so much to acquire a collection of natural gas assets when the sustainability of high prices was in doubt.The questions from Wall Street’s investment community came as Conoco shares, which had already lost 2.9 per cent of their value on Monday, fell a further 5 per cent on Tuesday to close at $58.26.The boards of Conoco and Burlington approved the cash-and-stock merger - the largest in the US energy industry in many years - on Monday night, after several weeks of negotiations.The price being offered by Conoco is $92 per share, or a 21 per cent premium over Burlington’s market value on Friday, prior to reports of a possible deal. In terms of “barrels of oil equivalent” - a common valuation metric in the energy industry - Conoco’s proposal is worth about $18/BoE, which analysts singled out as being relatively high. When Chevron bought California-based Unocal for $18bn in August, it paid about $10/BoE.“Burlington brings greater size to Conoco at an unacceptable cost,” wrote Mark Flannery, a research analyst at CSFB, in a note that suggested Conoco would have been better served by buying back its own shares.Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank added: “The near term concern will be that this is a high priced deal pitched at peak US natural gas prices.”Despite Wall Street’s frosty response to the acquisition, which would turn Conoco into the largest producer of natural gas in North America, Mr Mulva was adamant that the takeover made sense. In an interview with the FT on Monday night, he described the deal as a “unique and compelling opportunity”. On Tuesday, he added that the deal would be economical even if natural gas prices fell from their current level of $18 per million British thermal unit to about $5/mmBTU.Conoco and Burlington expect the merger to be completed before the end of June next year, after it receives approval from US regulators and Burlington shareholders. Cost-savings from the combination will amount to about $375m before tax, and, in the near term, the deal will enhance Conoco’s cashflow per share but cause a drop in its earnings.
687;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-13T19:56:34Z;Wall Street rallies as Fed changes language;;Stocks rallied sharply after changes in the Federal Reserve’s policy statement gave heart to Wall Street bulls. As expected, the Fed voted unanimously to raise the Fed funds target by another quarter point to 4.25 per cent.The move was already factored into the share prices. But investors were cheered by the Fed’s accompanying statement in which reference to rates being “accommodative”, or spurring growth, was dropped.In its place, the committee said “further measured policy firming is likely to be needed”.“This is the way we want to go,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards and Sons. “Although the Fed signalled that more rate rises might be ahead, its language suggested that we are nearing the end of the tightening cycle.”The announcement gave stocks a much needed boost. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.5 per cent, or 55.95 points, at 10,823.72, while the broader S&P 500 jumped 0.6 per cent, or 7 points, to 1,267.43. The Nasdaq Composite index turned round early losses to edge up 0.2 per cent, or 4.05 points, to 2,265.The Fed’s less hawkish stance stems partly from tame core inflation indicators. However, some retailers have suffered from their inability to pass on higher production costs from raw materials and energy to consumers.Stocks that are feeling pressure from this profit squeeze include Best Buy, which tumbled 11.8 per cent to $43.94 after reporting a 6.8 per cent drop in third-quarter profit. The company said sales were robust but earnings were hit by higher operating costs.Sentiment for the stock was also dented by monthly data that showed November retail sales were weaker than expected. In particular, demand for electronics and appliances rose less than investors had hoped and this weighed on some technology majors. IBM fell 2.4 per cent to $83.92 while Microsoft slipped 1.1 per cent to $27.15. A bearish sales forecast from Hewlett-Packard saw the computer group shed 2.7 per cent to $29.15. But Dell rose 2.1 per cent to $33.06.However, the losses were offset by gains in other blue chips. Pfizer rallied 6.1 per cent to $22.22 after it boosted quarterly dividend by 26 per cent. Procter & Gamble firmed up 2.8 per cent to $58.29, helped by news that the household goods giant had raised second-quarter estimates for both sales growth and earnings.Elsewhere, news that oil major ConocoPhillips had agreed to buy the natural gas producer Burlington Resources for $35.6bn, or $92 a share, sent stock in the former 5 per cent lower to $58.20.Burlington climbed 4.3 per cent to $86.07 to add to its 8.4 per cent gain from the previous session.General Motors skidded even further, off 3.3 per cent at $22.30, as investors continued to fret about Standard & Poor’s decision on Monday to slash the company’s debt rating by another two levels.
688;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-13T19:55:11Z;Lex: Conoco/Burlington;;James Mulva has joined the big league. The acquisition of Burlington Resources pitches ConocoPhillips within striking distance of Chevron - the number two US oil company. Mr Mulva has got there through bold acquisitions, which have proved shrewd investments as Conoco has ridden the surging oil and gas prices of recent years. However, size is not everything. Is his latest deal a bout of costly empire building, or a shrewd bet that the energy boom continues?It cannot be justified on the $375m of synergies Conoco says it will squeeze from the acquisition. Taxed, on a 10 times multiple, they are worth about $2.5bn, far from the $6bn control premium offered by Conoco. The synergy estimate includes $100m of exploration savings, which might be tough to maintain into the future.Instead Mr Mulva is in effect saying the stock market has underestimated the strength of US natural gas prices in the coming years. That might be true. Today’s record prices are the result of an already tight market being affected by hurricane damage and, recently, cold weather. Although prices should retreat, a few more bumper years would make a real difference to the deal’s economics. Conoco might also believe investors are overestimating the negative impact of new liquefied natural gas shipments to the US after 2008. But investors could have made that bet themselves on Burlington. Given the limited synergies, the deal magnifies Conoco’s status as a bet on the energy supercycle continuing.
689;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-13T18:28:11Z;Shell lifts outlay to $19bn in hunt for new oil;;Royal Dutch Shell raised its annual spending forecast by 27 per cent to $19bn, citing rising costs and the need to find new oil and gas reserves.Europe’s second-largest oil company will invest at least $4bn more than previously envisaged next year and said it was likely to keep spending at that level for several years.Shell’s rise in expenditure comes as the industry looks to plough more of its record profits into finding and producing oil and gas.In recent weeks ConocoPhillips and Chevron of the US have both announced plans substantially to lift their capital spending in 2006.Amid soaring energy prices, oil companies have opted to hand a large portion of their revenues to investors through dividends and stock buybacks. But a lack of easy exploration opportunities is forcing them to look further afield and spend more to develop new reserves.Jeroen van der Veer, Shell’s chief executive, said: “Global energy needs depend on the industry’s ability to sustain high levels of investment as the search for energy leads us to increasingly challenging and technically demanding environments.”More than half of Shell’s increased investment will go towards developing projects and boosting exploration. A fifth of the new spending will be aimed at squeezing more out of Shell’s existing fields.A quarter of the cost increase next year – about $1bn – is due to the rising cost of drilling rigs, labour and materials in the industry.Shell also pledged to continue returning cash to investors through stock buybacks.The revised budget reflects a number of cost overruns at Shell’s largest projects. Its Bonga field in Nigeria cost about $1bn more than expected to develop, while the price tag for the Sakhalin-2 project it leads in Russia has doubled to $20bn.The cost of finding and producing oil and gas has risen sharply in recent years, with companies having to undertake expensive deep-water drilling projects and big integrated gas projects. According to Wood Mackenzie oil consultancy, development costs at the largest publicly traded oil companies rose from $27.6bn in 1999 to $49.3bn in 2004.Spending seems set to rise further. A survey of 325 oil companies by Lehman Brothers investment bank found they were planning to increase spending on exploration and production by nearly 15 per cent next year.“The industry has entered a boom phase where exploration and product spending growth in 2005 and 2006 will likely exceed 20 per cent and earnings growth for the oil service and drilling companies will be dramatic,” Lehman said.
690;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-13T03:30:36Z;Conoco agrees to buy Burlington for $35.6bn;;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group, late on Monday agreed to buy Burlington Resources in a deal, valued at US$35.6bn, that will make it a leading north American natural gas producer.The acquisition underlines how rising US natural gas prices have revived interest in North America’s gas fields, which had been shunned in the past decade by the majors for assets that were both easier and cheaper to access abroad.Conoco will pay US$46.50 in cash and 0.7214 in stock for each Burlington share.Despite initial scepticism expressed by Wall Street in anticipation of the deal, James Mulva, Conoco chief executive, said in an interview that the deal represented “a unique and compelling opportunity’’ and that he expected it to be reflected in Conoco’s share price in the future.Mr Mulva touted the purchase as an opportunity to gain access to Burlington’s vast array of natural gas assets in continental US and Canada, where prices have been moving sharply higher in recent months.Conoco shares ended Monday’s session 2.9 per cent lower at $61.25, before the deal was finalised. Burlington shares ended 8.4 per cent higher at $82.50.“We believe the market will struggle with the strategic logic of such a tie-up from both the perspective of timing, given current record natural gas prices, and portfolio overlap, which at first glance we believe brings little to Conoco, save for scale,” said research analysts at Citigroup. The analysts’ note suggested there were better fits for Conoco than Burlington, which lacks significant deep-water exploration capacity – one of Conoco’s weaknesses.Others were more bullish. “Burlington is a decent acquisition for anybody who chases them,’’ said John Olson, co-manager of Houston Energy Partner Fund. He said Conoco had made a big bet on refining and marketing and this would rebalance the portfolio with more exploration and production.Once completed, the Burlington takeover will cement Mr Mulva’s reputation as one of the more aggressive chief executives in the energy industry.Last year, he led Conoco to the purchase of a minority stake in Russia’s Lukoil, also being courted by other international oil players. Before that he bought Conoco, as Phillips’ chief executive, to form the company he now heads.The deal is the largest in the US energy industry since November 2001, when Conoco was formed in the $25bn merger with Phillips Petroleum.
691;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-13T00:54:06Z;ConocoPhillips closes in on Burlington;;ConocoPhillips, the third largest US oil and gas group, was on Monday closing in on a deal to buy Burlington Resources for more than $30bn (£17.1bn, €25.4bn) , in a move to expand its production in North America. But news of the deal was greeted with scepticism on Wall Street.James Mulva, Conoco chief executive, and his counterpart at Burlington were hoping to gain approval for the takeover from the companies’ directors within the next 24 hours, according to people familiar with the matter.If sealed, the deal would be the largest in the US energy industry since November 2001, when Conoco was formed from a $25bn merger with Phillips Petroleum.Conoco is likely to tout the purchase as an opportunity to gain access to Burlington’s vast array of natural gas assets in the continental US and Canada, where prices have been moving sharply higher in recent months.But Wall Street reacted sceptically to that proposition, in the absence of details from Conoco and Burlington about the terms of the deal being negotiated.Conoco shares ended Monday’s session 2.9 per cent lower at $61.25.“We believe the market will struggle with the strategic logic of such a tie-up from both the perspective of timing given current record natural gas prices and portfolio overlap, which at first glance we believe brings little to Conoco, save for scale,” said research analysts at Citigroup. The analysts’ note suggested there were better fits for Conoco than Burlington, which lacks significant deep-water exploration capacity – one of Conoco’s weaknesses.Others were more bullish. “Burlington is a decent acquisition for anybody who chases them,’’ said John Olson, co-manager of Houston Energy Partner Fund. He said Conoco had made a big bet on refining and marketing and this would rebalance the portfolio with more exploration and production.Burlington shares ended 8.4 per cent higher at $82.50 after investors judged that the price being discussed would not be much higher than the company’s market value of $29bn at the end of last week. A “low-premium” deal could face opposition from Burlington shareholders campaigning for a higher price or provide room for a rival bid to be tabled.A takeover of Burlington would cement Mr Mulva’s reputation as one of the more aggressive chief executives in the energy industry.Last year, he led Conoco to the purchase of a minority stake in Russia’s Lukoil, also being courted by other international oil players.
692;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Conoco puts gas on the front burner;;ConocoPhillips’ interest in acquiring Burlington Resources underlines a strategic shift in the oil and gas industry’s view of US on-shore natural gas resources.Over the past five to 10 years, the big integrated companies have been selling out of those assets, or simply depleting them, without additional investment in their future.But the sharp rise in natural gas prices has led the companies to reconsider that strategy.Analysts say Conoco’s interest in buying Burlington – which consists of mostly US natural gas assets – is part of an emerging trend to reinvest in this area.“What used to look like dingy old assets that you depleted, they are now saying they can do frontier exploration on and make quite a bit of money,” says Richard Gordon of Gordon Energy Solutions, a consultancy.Frontier exploration is pursued in non-traditional areas, such as that embedded in rocks, mixed with sands or more than a mile under the ocean.Mr Gordon notes that Shell has been trying to expand its natural gas assets by buying acreage across the US – yet a much faster and easier way to cash in on the high-price environment is to buy assets from a company such as Burlington.Burlington gets about 84 per cent of its production and 89 per cent of its reserves from North America, with most of that located in the Rocky Mountain region and Canada. It boasts of a speciality in “maximising reserve recovery from geologically complex reservoirs” – the skills needed for the assets now being tapped.Buying Burlington would double Conoco’s North American natural gas production and boost its overall production by 20 per cent, says Tom Covington of AG Edwards. And Burlington’s assets are such that the company is considered a stable, long-life gas producer.The irony, analysts say, is that Conoco, the third-biggest oil and gas company in the US, had been selling North American assets in recent years – along with everyone else in the sector – leaving the remaining small and difficult finds to independent producers such as Burlington to exploit.“The big question here, is does this signal a return of the majors to North America?” says Mr Covington.He notes that ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly listed oil and gas company, has done a series of deals recently that indicate it sees value in North American gas, by farming out acreage or doing joint ventures with small independents that develop the assets.“In the old days, they just divested these properties and got out,” Mr Covington says. “What this says is they believe there is sustainability to the North American gas prices.”The deal would be the first big acquisition of US assets in a long time, analysts say. The last consolidation phase, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, involved global companies such as Exxon acquiring Mobil, Chevron acquiring Texaco and Phillips acquiring Conoco.Investors sold Conoco’s shares yesterday as news of the possible deal emerged, although analysts say that could have been attributed to worries over price, more than the strategic sense of the deal.Given that recent US exploration and production deals have had about a 15 per cent premium, such a deal would not be cheap, says Doug Leggate of Citigroup Investment Research. Indeed, the figure being bandied about is $30bn.But at a time when the majors are awash with cash and looking to make strategic investments, spending that sum to get a solid position in the North American natural gas scene makes sense to many.“It’s a place you really want to be and need to be,” says Garfield Miller of Aegis Energy Advisors.
693;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-12T21:32:57Z;Wall Street mixed despite M&A talk;;Energy producers were on the move on Monday after ConocoPhillips’ reported approach for natural gas producer Burlington Resources fanned speculation that more large deals might be on the horizon.Burlington shares jumped 8.4 per cent to $82.50 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the two were in advanced talks that could value Burlington at more than $30bn.Conoco, however, fell 2.9 per cent to $61.25 as investors questioned the wisdom of such a deal, which came as Burlington’s shares were already trading at record highs. Soaring energy prices have driven shares in Burlington up by more than 100 per cent since the beginning of the year.“We see limited value in Burlington today given a lack of significant growth potential and a valuation that reflects high long-term gas prices,” said Credit Suisse First Boston in a note.The expensive valuations in the sector did little to dissuade investors, however. With natural gas prices hitting record highs and supplies expected to remain tight, investors bought up shares in other large-cap onshore gas companies on hopes that a deal between Conoco and Burlington would stimulate further sector consolidation.Devon, which has roughly the same market capitalisation as Burlington, rose 1.7 per cent to $66.39 while EnCana, another large sector player climbed 2.3 per cent to $51.24. Smaller rival EOG added 2.8 per cent to $78.80 and natural gas pipline owner Williams Companies added 4 per cent per cent to $23.65.Overall, the S&P energy sector rose 1 per cent. However, the gains were not enough to prop up the wider market which was pressured by higher bond yields and commodity prices.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent, or 10.81 points, at 10,767.77, while the broader S&P 500 edged up 0.1 per cent, or 1.06 points, to 1,260.43. The Nasdaq Composite index, helped by Intel’s 2.1 per cent advance, rose 0.2 per cent, or 4.22 points, to 2,260.95.Merck was a notable drag on the Dow. Shares in the troubled drugmaker dropped 2.5 per cent to $28.41 after a mis-trial was declared in a federal liability case over the use of its recalled painkiller Vioxx.In Hollywood, Viacom’s $1.6bn purchase of DreamWorks SKG provided tinseltown with a deal of its own to cheer about. Investors reacted positively, bidding Viacom up 0.8 per cent to $34.71.In the latest case of shareholder revolt, Career Education, one of US’s largest operators of for-profit colleges, skidded 4.5 per cent to $33.09 after a major shareholder called for the resignation of the company’s top managing directors. The call came as the company was removed from the Nasdaq 100.Elsewhere, Google nudged up 0.8 per cent to $412.61 after CSFB raised its target price for the internet search company from $400 to $475, citing growing momentum in the online advertising market.
694;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-12T19:26:55Z;Lex: Conoco/Burlington;;ConocoPhillips is doubling down on North America. Already heavily weighted to the region through refining and upstream assets, it will account for more than half the oil group’s revenues if it buys Burlington Resources. So far, its exposure to developed markets has stood Conoco in good stead. It is weighted towards higher cost production, where margin expansion from high oil prices is particularly marked, and to US refining, which has enjoyed a great run. But does bulking up in US natural gas, as prices hit new highs, make sense?Strategically, it will not solve the problem that Conoco shares with rivals: low production growth. Burlington is a mature business. Also, it is not a cheap home for Conoco’s cash – likely to play a significant part in any deal. CSFB estimates Burlington is worth about $15 per barrel of oil equivalent. Conoco, after stripping out refining and its Lukoil stake, trades on about half that.Rather, buying Burlington would be a way of reducing Conoco’s relative exposure to refining and a bet that gas prices remain stronger for longer. The next few years look attractive. North American production should remain broadly flat. Assuming demand remains robust, the market will remain tightly balanced and prone to spikes from disruptive events such as hurricanes or cold weather. However, there is a chance that demand will soften as the full force of price rises feeds through into consumer utility bills. And from about 2008, a wave of liquefied natural gas will hit the US, as import facilities come on stream. That should hurt pricing, although Conoco could hedge some of its exposure.James Mulva, Conoco chief executive, has been slow to return recent windfall profits to shareholders. If he spends it on Burlington, he must make a compelling case for why it is a better investment than Conoco’s own shares.
695;COP;Conocophillips;2005-12-01T22:39:26Z;Probe urged into oil meetings;;The top ranking Democrat in the US Senate on Thursday called for an investigation into whether senior oil executives lied in testimony before Congress about meetings they held with Dick Cheney, vice-president, to discuss energy policy.Harry Reid’s decision to call on the Justice Department to investigate the testimony of executives from ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell and ConocoPhillips revives long-running questions about who participated in a series of secretive “task force” meetings Mr Cheney held in 2001 that helped shape US energy policy.An appeals court in May ruled that Mr Cheney did not have to divulge who participated in the meetings after the Bush administration argued that to do so would interfere with “vital executive branch functions”.The issue was brought back to life last month after the heads of the world’s biggest oil companies testified before a congressional hearing that they had not participated, or did not recall participating, in the task force.But in written responses to the Senate energy committee released this week, BP, Chevron, Shell and ExxonMobil admitted officials had met administration officials at the time the task force was evaluating energy issues.Ross Pillari, president and chief executive of BP America, had said at the hearing he did not know whether BP had participated in the meetings, but in his written response admitted: “BP representatives did meet with [task force] staff members.”Dave O’Reilly, chairman and chief executive of Chevron, said company representatives did not attend meetings with administration officials “for the purpose” of discussing task force activities, but did have discussions on energy policy with officials in the administration.ExxonMobil said none of its executives had attended any meetings of the task force, but confirmed a report in the Washington Post that said company officials had met a member of the administration in February 2001.
696;COP;Conocophillips;2005-11-09T21:39:02Z;Overview: Optimism bubbling under for equities;;"Early losses on Wall Street made life tough for European equity markets on Wednesday as caution over interest rates and the quality of earnings guidance remained.Downgrades for Renault, the carmaker, and an earnings warning from Deutsche Telekom as it planned to expand its mobile division, hit two of the most heavily weighted sectors on the pan-European index, overshadowing some impressive third quarter earnings.However, the optimism that was seen in equities markets in early November appeared to be bubbling under the surface, waiting for a decisive move from Wall Street and for clearer signals from the European Central Bank on the timing of its next interest rate move.Credit Suisse First Boston remained positive on European equities, given that third quarter earnings surprises were still above average.“We continue to recommend a marginal overweight of equities of 1 per cent,” said analyst Andrew Garthwaite. “But when inflation concerns peak, or if the S&P 500 fell to 1,150, we would look to raise our equity weightings.”Holland’s Rabobank on Wednesday became the latest investment bank to rethink its outlook on US Federal Reserve policy because of higher-than-expected headline inflation. “It is difficult to see the Fed stopping before 4.5 per cent,” said strategist Jitzes Noorman. “Beyond that, the chance of an economic slowdown emerging increases.”The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index finished down 1.35 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 1,225.26.Only Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax outperformed in Europe, gaining 0.1 per cent thanks to strong earnings from Bayer, the drugs and chemicals group.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.1 per cent at 10,545.01 and the S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,220.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.2 per cent to 2,175.81.On Wall Street, energy stocks came under pressure as bosses from ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips defended their profits to a Senate hearing demanding to know when oil prices would begin to ease.A brief answer was provided by an unexpectedly large increase in US crude oil inventories. US government data showed that, last week, crude supplies increased by 4.5m barrels, much more than the 1.6m predicted by analysts. Nymex West Texas Intermediate fell below $59 a barrel shortly after the publication of the numbers and, in spite of a midsession rally on dwindling supplies of distillate stocks, ended down 78 cents at $58.93.In other commodity markets, platinum, the precious metal used in jewellery and catalytic converters, rose to a 25-and-a-half-year peak on expected higher demand
for diesel catalysts. Platinum rose as high as $955 an ounce, levels not seen since 1980.Gold gained for a third straight day as the metal became more attractive as a hedge against inflation. Bullion closed in London at $465.50 an ounce, up $4.30 from the previous session.Government bonds were weaker, as profit-taking hit US Treasuries after a two-day rally.Eurozone government bonds fell after Axel Weber, a member of the ECB’s governing council, said risks to price stability had risen “markedly”, and reiterated the central bank’s current mantra of “strong vigilance”.The dollar was marginally higher against other currencies in a quiet session in the foreign exchange market."
697;COP;Conocophillips;2005-11-02T00:54:28Z;Oil chiefs summoned to Senate;;Top executives at some of the biggest oil companies in the US have been summoned to Washington to answer increasingly hostile complaints from lawmakers that the energy industry is enjoying record profits at the expense of American consumers.Lee Raymond, Exxon Mobil's chairman and chief executive, James Mulva of ConocoPhillips, and Shell USA president John Hofmeister have agreed to testify before two Senate committees next Wednesday, a Senate spokesperson confirmed.They are expected to face sharp questioning about rising energy prices and to explain whether their companies will use record third-quarter profits to invest in additional resources that could lower prices in future.The decision to call Mr Raymond and other executives to Washington underscores how dramatic the high cost of petrol and home heating oil has become a top concern for lawmakers in recent weeks.The public hearings are likely to provide more drama than substance: lawmakers appear to be seizing on the energy issue because unlike the war in Iraq or recent Washington scandals it offers an easy opportunity to show they are acting on voters' concerns.Some Republican senators will face a tough balancing act, criticising oil groups while maintaining their traditional pro-business and anti-regulatory stance.“Oil companies have failed to tell us and show us what they are doing with these profits that justify them. Normally, business doesn't have to [justify profits] …but when prices remain so high and do so much damage …then it seems that they owe us an in depth analysis,” said Pete Domenici, Republican chairman of the Senate energy committee, which will join with the commerce committee for the hearings.
698;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Wall Street grapples with disappointing earnings;;Wall Street bulls struggled to hold their ground on Wednesday in the face of disappointing corporate news from two bellwethers of the retailing and industrial sector.Amazon, the internet’s largest retailer, tumbled 13.9 per cent to $39.75 after the company forecast fourth-quarter sales below some analysts’ estimates.Boeing, the defence and aerospace group, reported doubling profits in its third quarter due to the sale of one of its divisions. However, shares fell 2.8 per cent to $65.10 as analysts took stock of below-forecast sales.Another pocket of weakness came from Flextronics, one of the world’s largest electronics manufacturers, which fell 24 per cent to $9.20 after the company gave analysts a guidance on its outlook for its third quarter below previous estimates. Solectron, a rival, was 1.9 per cent behind at $3.58.The effects of hurricanes on the southern United States continued to make themselves felt, as PF Chang’s China Bistro, which cut its fourth-quarter income forecast due to the closure of a restaurant in Louisiana. Its shares lost 11.8 per cent to $44.38.In the energy sector, Kerr-McGee edged off 0.7 per cent to $85.25 after the oil producer swung back to profitability thanks to rising oil prices.Also in energy, ConocoPhillips added 0.6 per cent to $62.80 after the oil major announced third-quarter profits that almost doubled last year’s figure in the comparable quarter.The rise came as weekly data on oil and fuel inventories showed rising reserves of crude in the US, leading to a decline in oil futures.By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 32.89 points, or 0.3 per cent, behind at 10,344.98, while the broader S&P 500 index eased 0.4 per cent, or 5.16 points, to 1,191.38. The Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.5 per cent, or 9.40 points, to 2,100.05.Marc Pado, US markets strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, noted that the main US equity gauges are nearing resistance levels and advised clients to “look for bulls to work a little harder to gain ground from here”.DuPont, up 1.7 per cent to $41.50, and JPMorgan Chase, up 1.1 per cent to $36.10, led the gains on the Dow.Among telecoms stocks, Sprint Nextel shares lost 2.8 per cent to $23 after the mobile carrier disappointed analysts with slowing subscriber growth, even though it reported higher profits in the third quarter.Lucent Technologies, which makes telecommunications equipment, saw shares give up 5.8 per cent to $2.93 after it reported declining profits on rising sales in the third quarter.InfoSpace, a technology services company, provided a bright spot for techs with its 13.5 per cent to $25.24 after it reported above-forecast profits in the third quarter, triggering off upgrades of its stock by analysts and RBC Capital Markets and Delafield Hambrecht.
699;COP;Conocophillips;2005-10-26T16:44:06Z;Conoco profits skyrocket by 90 per cent;;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, saw its profits soar nearly 90 per cent over the past year, despite the impact of the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.Exceeding market expectations, the company on Wednesday reported net income for the third quarter of $3.8bn, compared with just over $2bn in the same period last year. Diluted income per share was $2.68, compared with $1.43 per share the previous year.Like other oil companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico, ConocoPhillips’s oil and gas production was heavily hit by this year’s record hurricane season. The company said it had lost 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Dennis, added to 40,000 b/d of lost production from planned and unplanned downtime in the North Sea and Alaska.The average production, of 1.52m b/d, was slightly lower than the previous quarter, but still ahead of the year before, the company said. Its 15 per cent equity stake in Russia’s Lukoil yielded a further 270,000 b/d.“During the quarter, our US Gulf Coast operations were significantly impacted by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Dennis,” said Jim Mulva, chairman and chief executive. “Despite these impacts, our overall operating performance for the quarter was good, and we continued to benefit from the strong commodity price environment.”The world’s largest oil companies are benefiting from oil prices at record highs. But because the governments that control oil and gas resources do not give them access, they have relatively few attractive places in which to invest their bumper profits. Like most large oil companies, ConocoPhilips has therefore returned part of its mounting cash pile to investors.In the third quarter, the company paid $430m in dividends, reduced debt by $516m and repurchased $588m of ConocoPhillips shares.The company’s refining and marketing operation reported third quarter net income of $1.39bn – almost twice the amount it made in the same period the previous year. The company said its improved downstream performance was primarily the result of the soaring refining margins seen last quarter.However, the result was partially offset by lower marketing margins around the world. Like BP earlier this week, ConocoPhillips said it was unable to pass on the full increase in the cost of oil products to retail customers.Another segment that struggled last quarter was the company’s petrochemicals business, which reported net income of $13m, down from $81m in the same quarter last year. The company blamed hurricane-related shutdowns and lower margins in the olefins and derivatives sector.ConocoPhillips’ shares rose more than 20 per cent last quarter, more than the sector average.
700;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US stocks slide as inflation fears persist;;Wall Street fell sharply on Thursday as worries over rising inflation and interest rates once again hung over the market.A slide in oil and natural gas prices off the back of rising inventories caused a major sell-off in energy stocks, with the Amex oil index slumping 4.7 per cent.Conoco Phillips fell 6.2 per cent to $57.75, Amerada Hess lost 5.3 per cent $112.75, Chevron slid 4.4 per cent to $55.75 and Exxon Mobil gave up 3.3 per cent at $55.26.A wider-ranging sell-off was sparked by the release of the Philadelphia Fed index, which showed both the prices paid by manufacturers’ for materials and the prices received for finished goods rose at their fastest pace for 25 years this month.“We have continued to have Fed speakers talk about interest rates going higher and the prices paid component [of the Philly Fed] was awful, as bad as we have seen since 1980,” said Jim Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management.“The last place people had profits was oil shares and we have now seen them pulling out. We are entering the capitulation stage.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 133.03 points, or 1.3 per cent, at 10,281.10, with the wider S&P 500 falling 17.95 points, or 1.5 per cent, at 1,177.81 and the Nasdaq Composite losing 23.13 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 2,068.11.In spite of falling oil prices, the Amex airline index also slumped 5.8 per cent. JetBlue fell 7.6 per cent to $18.05 as Standard & Poor’s cut its credit rating, citing an expected full-year-loss on the back of high energy prices.Denver-based Frontier Airlines dropped 28.6 per cent to $7.68 as rival Southwest Airlines said it would start a service from Denver in 2006.Elsewhere, earnings dominated. Drugs company Pfizer was among blue-chips to disappoint, reporting that third-quarter earnings fell 52 per cent due to acquisition-related charges. Its shares fell 8.6 per cent to $21.90.Online auction site eBay slid 6.8 per cent to $39.15 in spite of reporting a 40 per cent jump in third-quarter earnings. The market was disappointed by eBay’s fourth-quarter earnings forecast, which was dragged lower by acquisition costs.West Pharmaceutical Services was punished by the market for raising third-quarter earnings to 24 cents a share, compared with forecasts of 33 cents, as gross margins fell. The shares lost 14.5 per cent at $23.43.But Coca-Cola rose 0.7 per cent to $42.10 as it beat analyst expectations by posting third-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share. And network equipment maker Juniper Networks firmed 3.6 per cent to $22.79 as third-quarter earnings leapt 72 per cent on strong sales of routers.
701;COP;Conocophillips;2005-10-04T20:05:25Z;Hurricanes set to blow $700m hole in BP profits;;The hurricanes that swept through the Gulf of Mexico have wiped more than $700m (€573m) from the third-quarter profits of BP, Europe's biggest oil company, and caused it to miss its production target for the year, the group said on Tuesday.BP expects the storms to have cost it about 145,000 barrels a day in lost production in the third quarter. That was about double analysts' estimates, causing some investment banks to cut BP's profit forecasts.The hurricanes also forced a slowdown of activity at BP's Texas City refinery, preventing the company taking full advantage of soaring refining margins. The high cost of fuel probably caused BP to lose money at petrol stations. Goldman Sachs cut BP's expected operating profit for the quarter by $1.45bn.The oil company said in a business update: “Trading conditions experienced by BP in the third quarter of 2005 were significantly impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and their aftermath.” BP is still expected to deliver bumper profits this year, driven by soaring oil prices, in spite of its problems in the Gulf of Mexico. Shares fell 2.7 per cent yesterday to 657.27p.Most oil companies operating in the storm-prone region have been severely affected by this year's hurricanes. ConocoPhillips, the US oil major, said on Monday that it was losing about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent production a day because of the storms. Royal Dutch Shell has suffered extensive damage at its Mars platform, while Chevron's Typhoon platform is floating upside-down.For BP, the storm damage comes after a series of misfortunes hurt its bottom line. The company said on Tuesday that repairs to its flagship Thunder Horse oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which was left listing in the water after a storm in July, would cost it $100m.The mishap has delayed the start-up of production from the platform, which had been due to begin pumping 250,000 barrels of oil a day and 200m cubic feet of natural gas by the end of the year. BP is also losing a further 160,000 barrels a day of production from the North Sea this quarter due to planned maintenance. It has also previously taken a $700m charge to compensate victims of an explosion in March at its Texas City refinery, which killed 15 workers and injured more than 170. The US government imposed a record $21.3m fine on BP for “egregious” health and safety violations. The company agreed to make sweeping changes to procedures.
702;COP;Conocophillips;2005-10-04T17:02:40Z;Oct 4: BP gives the market a shock;;I’m Henry Tricks, a senior corporate reporter at the FT, standing in today for Charles Pretzlik who’s away.It has to be a gripping day for corporate news when BP gives the market a shock. The oil company, which in this week’s FT Global 500 was the biggest UK company by a cool $25bn, has helped propel the FTSE to four-year highs, on the back of $60 oil prices. But as our story shows, its production has been blown off course by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, knocking a $700m hole in its third quarter profits. If you like, read the full trading statement. BP has dragged the FTSE down in its wake, as our market report reflects. We’re checking to see how much of the bad news is, indeed, hurricane related, and whether Royal Dutch Shell and other oil majors will be affected. Judging by Shell’s falling share price on Monday, investors fear it will be. In the US, Chevron Corp and ConocoPhillips have also warned recently that their earnings will be hit by storm damage, ahead of earnings season later this month. Amongst oil companies, production levels are often watched as closely as sales figures at non-oil companies, and it is understandable the market has taken fright at a fall in output that is double, in BP’s case, what some analysts had expected. On the other hand, recovery shouldn’t take long, provided there are no new storms. As Lex suggests, investors in BP should be sanguine and look through today’s “slight disappointment”.Among other top stories, we’ll be following the continuing takeover saga surrounding Aegis, which said today in a press release it has met with more than one potential suitor. Our correspondent Gary Silverman has the latest news: It has become clear that WPP, the advertising agency, has teamed up with US private equity group Hellman & Friedman, to bid for the company, with a view to breaking it up. These two were former sparring partners over Grey Global, another advertising group, so it is curious to see them in the same camp now. Gary’s story raises the tantalising prospect of a bidding war for Aegis, but it also notes no bids are on the table, so it could all end up as hot air - appropriate for the advertising industry, you might say. Will France’s Publicis react, two weeks after it made an indicative offer for Aegis? You can bet everyone will be badgering them and their bankers to find out.There will be more follow-up in Wednesday’s paper on our Boots, Alliance Unichem scoop from Saturday as the two management teams meet investors today who have had mixed feelings about the proposed merger. We’ll also be looking at the European ambitions of Aim, the Alternative Investment Market, after LSE chairman Chris Gibson-Smith said it was talking to potential users in many countries. We probably won’t play this story as prominently as the Evening Standard, however. We’ve known for a long time that Aim is looking at markets in northern Europe, such as the Benelux countries. It’s also already attracting issuers from as far away as Kazakhstan. But it’s no bad thing it’s not resting on its laurels. Lombard will apply its wit and wisdom to the topic in Wednesday’s paper, as well as scrutinising the latest on Aegis.For now, that’s it from me. Charles will be back tomorrow.
703;COP;Conocophillips;2005-09-22T09:05:52Z;Houston evacuates as Rita roars in;;At least one million people on Thursday were fleeing the Texas coast as Hurricane Rita, now a category four storm, homed in on the Gulf of Mexico.Houston, heart of the US oil industry, is continuing the mass evacuation of low-lying, flood-prone areas of the Texas city as the threat intensified.Oil prices continued on an upward path as Rita approached Gulf of Mexico production facilities and forced six Texan refineries to shut down. A quarter of total US refining capacity is based in Texas, and the US government’s Energy Information Administration warned the hurricane could have a “substantial impact”.Energy companies ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have ordered staff to leave platforms in the Gulf, which account for nearly a third of US oil output.About five per cent of US refining capacity is still out of commission. Global Insight, an economic consultancy, said another 20 per cent of capacity was at risk of temporary shut downs. “If Hurricane Rita caused significant damage to multiple refineries, it could be a national disaster since we still have four refineries shut down because of Katrina,” said Bill Greehey, chief executive of Valero, America's largest refiner.The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday played down the impact of high oil prices on the global economy. Impact of higher energy costs had been “surprisingly moderate” on growth and inflation, the Fund's twice-yearly World Economic Outlook said.It reduced only very modestly its global growth forecast but noted risks to the outlook were “slanted to the downside”. High oil prices posed a “clear and present danger”, said Raghuram Rajan, IMF chief economist.Hurricane Rita is forecast to hit land on Friday, somewhere between northern Mexico and Louisiana but most likely Texas. Experts said preparations in Houston had so far been exemplary after the inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina damaged the credibility of federal, state and local governments.In New Orleans, the city devastated by floods last month, engineers rushed to repair severely damaged levees. Some estimates suggested even three inches of rain would overwhelm the flood protection system.Many Houston residents, who witnessed first-hand the horror of Hurricane Katrina, were urgently preparing last night to escape the storm, booking nearly all hotels in Austin, San Antonio and Dallas. Panic buying emptied shelves of batteries, water and other emergency provisions at groceries and superstores.Houston Mayor Bill White asked those in vulnerable areas to leave, companies to release non-essential staff and schools to close as the storm headed for the US' fourth most heavily populated city. To leave Houston will be mandatory for those living in mobile homes and storm surge zones at 6am on Thursday.

707;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

709;COP;Conocophillips;2005-09-19T20:21:56Z;Wall Street lower despite energy gains;;Oil shares on Wall Street were boosted on Monday by another rise in crude prices and news that Norway’s Norsk Hydro plans to takeover Spinnaker Exploration for $2.5bn in cash.Shares in the Houston-based Spinnaker Exploration shares swelled 31.5 per cent to $64.12 by the close on Monday.Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach & Co, described the premium as “hefty” and said more deals could follow, with the sector ripe for consolidation.The jump was part of a broader advance for energy stocks that saw Amerada Hess put on 4.3 per cent to $139.31 after JP Morgan’s Jennifer Rowland upgraded the stock and raised the sector’s earnings target.Marathon Oil rose 1.8 per cent to $69.19, while ConocoPhillips added 1.6 per cent to $70.24. ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded oil company in the world, was up 1.4 per cent to $64.63 and became the fourth company in the S&P 500 index to reach a market capitalisation of more than $400bn. The energy sector now makes up 10 per cent of the S&P 500, for the first time since 1994.Energy stocks were fired up by a rally in crude futures amid concerns about another hurricane hitting the production capacity in the Gulf of Mexico. In late trading, prices for West Texas Intermediate for October delivery rose more than $4 to $67.39 a barrel as Tropical Storm Rita gathered strength and headed for the Gulf.Airline stocks fell amid concerns about the effects of high fuel prices on an industry plagued by cost pressures. The Amex airline index lost 3.4 per cent as AirTran, the low-cost carrier, gave up 5.7 per cent to $10.43. Continental Airlines was 6.3 per cent off at $10.98.Among other stocks in the news, Nike rose 6.4 per cent to $83.45 after its third-quarter profits beat expectations.

The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,145.21.However, Art Hogan, chief US analyst at Jefferies, also attributed some of the fall to Friday’s 0.8 per cent rise in the Dow off the back of the expiration of September futures and options contracts. He argued that at least half such moves are typically retraced in the following session.Investors also were awaiting the outcome of a keenly watched meeting on Tuesday of the monetary policy body of the US Federal Reserve. The US central bank is widely expected to raise benchmark interest rates by a quarter point to 3.75 per cent.Mr Cardillo believed most market participants were still expecting a quarter-point hike, and argued that the market had now priced in the likelihood of the Fed holding rates at 3.5 per cent.
710;COP;Conocophillips;2005-09-16T08:20:20Z;Statoil says Arctic gas project is $1.1bn over budget;;Statoil came under pressure on Friday after the Norwegian energy group said the development of a new gas project in the Barents sea was running eight months behind schedule and would be NKr7bn ($1.1bn) over budget.Following a review, the oil and gas group and its partners were told that the Snøhvit licence in the Norwegian Arctic would now need NKr58.3bn of investment, NKr7bn more than initially planned. Gas production is expected to start on June 1 2007 and regular deliveries from December 1 the same year.Statoil said it was working on obtaining alternative gas supplies for its customers in Spain and the US, until Snøhvit comes on stream.However, the news was tempered by an announcement by Russia’s Gazprom on Friday that Statoil had been shortlisted, together with Norsk Hydro, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Total of France, to develop its Shtokman gas project in the Barents Sea. The Russian group said the list would be narrowed down to two or three partners in the next few months.Snøhvit is a key project for the energy group, giving it access to the US market, as well as opening up the Barents sea. Statoil’s partners on the project include: Petoro, Total, Gaz de France, Amerada Hess and RWE-Dea.Statoil blamed the overrun on delayed engineering, quality flaws to modules from Europe that then had to be transferred, failure to assess the full scope of the work and extra work at Melkøya, an island outside Hammerfest in northern Norway where the gas will converted to LNG.“The Snøhvit project has struggled with problems from the outset, mainly because the project was not sufficiently mature when it was sanctioned in 2001,” said Helge Lund, chief executive. “The new review of costs and progress has revealed that control of the project has been insufficient and we have not managed to correct the imbalances in the project quickly enough.”Mr Lund admitted that the work remaining at Melkøya was surprisingly large and he had commissioned an independent review, to take place after the project has been completed, to assess what went wrong. However, he said the project would still be profitable.Under the revised plan, the project will affect Statoil’s production in 2007. Statoil has not changed its 2007 targets though it said it would review the situation in the autumn.
711;COP;Conocophillips;2005-09-06T18:59:18Z;Saudi Arabia urges Opec to cover shortfall in crude;;Saudi Arabia is leading the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to lower prices and pump more oil to compensate for the loss of crude production from the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Katrina.The kingdom, the world’s largest oil producer, widened on Monday the discount at which it sells its oil to US and European refineries to a six-month high.The decision, which represents a U-turn from recent Saudi policy, would encourage demand for the kingdom’s oil and could be followed by other Gulf producers, Opec officials and oil traders said.The move comes ahead of an Opec meeting in two weeks and after the US lost 20 per cent of its oil production and 10 per cent of its refinery capacity.US oil production in the Gulf of Mexico recovered on Monday to 69.6 per cent of the pre-Katrina level of 1.5m barrels a day. At the peak of the hurricane disruption, output was 95 per cent down. In addition, four of the eight refineries hit by the storm were restarting on Tuesday.However, three other large refineries owned by ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, which have a capacity of 750,000 b/d – about 5 per cent of the US total – are still flooded.“For these plants water damage, particularly in facility control rooms, seems to be the most important obstacle to a restart. Lack of communication from the companies suggests extensive downtime,” said Paul Sankey, of Deutsche Bank in New York. “In the past it has taken plants up to eight months to return to full operations,” he added.US oil prices fell on Tuesday by $1.50 to $66 a barrel as the market reacted to the release of the industrial countries’ emergency stocks, but analysts said the refinery problems would keep prices high. The market was also worried that oil demand could drop if the global economy slowed because of the oil price jump. That concern is shared by Opec, which could consider at its meeting in Vienna increasing its output ceiling from the current level of 28m b/d.“Some countries favour an increase [of the quotas] of 500,000 b/d and others talks about 1m b/d,” an Opec official said. The 10 Opec members subject to quotas – Iraq is excluded – pumped in July about 28.3m b/d, or 300,000 above its official ceiling. Traders said production was higher last month.Iran, one of the organisation’s hawkish members, has already supported a 500,000 b/d increase. Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, Iranian Opec delegate, said: “Opec members will most probably raise the organisation’s oil production ceiling in a bid to stabilise oil markets.”Saudi Arabia is the only Opec member with a significant amount of spare capacity, although the bulk of it is concentrated in low quality oil. The kingdom pumps about 9.5m b/d. Ali Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, offered in the aftermath of the hurricane to raise output to the 11m b/d of maximum capacity.Some traders cautioned that the big discounts offered by Saudi Arabia were not a surprise and could not translate into higher demand for the kingdom oil. Some of the closed refineries in the Gulf of Mexico specialised in low-quality Saudi oil, which means demand would not rise until they come back on line.

Nymex crude futures finished the day up $2.61 at $69.81.Retailers and restaurants dominated the top 10 fallers in the S&P 500 with Staples, the office supply chain, falling 2.9 per cent to $21.85 and Darden Restaurants fell 2.8 per cent to $30.61. Tiffany, the jewellers, fell 2.6 per cent to $33.31. Wal-Mart also fell 1 per cent to $45.19 after announcing that 123 stores had been shut down due to a power cut.Insurers and re-insurers suffered. Shares of American International Group fell 0.4 per cent $59.28 and Hartford Financial Services dropped almost 0.3 per cent to $73.15.The transport sector, another area of the US economy that will see profits squeezed by higher oil prices, was also well down. United Parcel Service was 1.1 per cent down at $70.42 and CSX, a rail freight company, slipped 1.7 per cent to $44.85.The oil price was bad news for long-suffering airlines with Delta Air Lines, the cash strapped carrier widely expected to be the next airline to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, down 5.5 per cent to $1.20. The Amex airline index dipped 3 per cent at 46.75.All of which left the indices lower by the close, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.5 per cent at 10,412.82 and the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent at 1,208.41. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent at 2,129.76.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said the bears need not despair, however, citing a “longer-term rally”.“That rally is a series of higher-lows. Even the weakest market average remains above its June low. If this decline bottoms out around these levels, it will appear to be just a normal pullback within the context of that ongoing rally.”The news that a measure of consumer confidence showed that Americans’ attitudes about the economy improved in August only gave the most brief of respites to indices. While the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence rose in August the US Commerce Department released a report showing a less than expected decline in factory orders in July.Oil producers continued to benefit from high prices with ConocoPhillips, the largest US refiner, gaining 2.1 per cent to $64.41. Halliburton, the world’s biggest oilfield services company, rose 3.5 per cent to $59.84.After rising, Sprint Nextel, the third largest US mobile-telephone company, which announced it had agreed to buy an affiliate for $427m, fell 1.3 per cent to $25.25.
713;COP;Conocophillips;2005-08-12T23:48:26Z;Oil prices move past $67 for first time;;"US oil prices broke through $67 a barrel for the first time on Friday, setting their fifth consecutive nominal record as latest oil consumption data show high crude prices are hitting emerging Asian economies.The International Energy Agency, the industrial countries' watchdog, highlighted the economic impact as it cut its growth forecast for oil demand from the region for this year to 3.1 per cent, down from last year's 5.2 per cent growth.“There is evidence that growth in key [Chinese] energy consuming industrial sectors has slowed to a certain extent,” the IEA said. But strong consumption in other areas is offsetting the soft demand from Asia and supporting oil prices, and worldwide oil demand is still forecast to accelerate in 2006.The impact of record oil prices has been accentuated recently as several Asian countries, including Thailand, China and Vietnam, cut fuel subsidies and passed the burden of higher oil costs from their national budgets to households.Indian oil companies are also pressing the government to lift the price they can charge consumers as the refineries face mounting losses.The increase in the retail price of petrol has triggered a slowdown in Chinese consumption, as households face higher fuel bills. China is the second largest oil importer, behind the US.Oil prices were up $1.40 to $67.10 in afternoon New York trading, before closing just below $67, as a spate of refinery outages at BP, ConocoPhillips and Premcor plants in the US increased market worries about winter supply. The Nymex September contract finished in New York at $66.86.“A tense geopolitical situation plus a recent glut of crude oil production shortfalls are all serving to put additional upward pressure on prices,” said Kevin Norrish, of Barclays Capital in London.The spiralling price of oil added further to the US import bill in June, which helped to push the US trade deficit to $58.8bn, a 6.1 per cent increase.Crude oil imports climbed to $14.6bn in June compared with $13.7bn in May. The politically sensitive trade deficit with China increased by $1.8bn to $17.6bn. Any deterioration in this bilateral deficit has tended to inflame trade tensions with China.

714;COP;Conocophillips;2005-08-09T08:43:03Z;Security worries push oil price towards $65;;"Warnings of a possible terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia and worries over Iran's resumption of its nuclear programme helped push crude prices to nominal records, with analysts saying the price could soon breach $65 a barrel.US light sweet crude soared past Monday’s record high in early electronic trade on Tuesday hitting a new peak of $64.05 a barrel as an already-tight market reacted to warnings from the US, the UK and Australia of potential attacks in Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer.Britain talked of ""credible reports"" that terrorists were in the ""final stages of planning attacks"" in the kingdom, a warning that was echoed by the Australian government and came as the US closed its missions in Saudi Arabia, also citing a terrorist threat.The futures market has been driven higher by one of the worst sequences of refinery stoppages in years. Valero and ConocoPhillips both confirmed on Monday that they had had problems at refineries over the weekend.Prices were also lifted by Iran's resumption of nuclear activities at a uranium conversion plant in Isfahan - a move that brings Tehran closer to threatened United Nations sanctions.Oil traders fear Iran's resumption of its nuclear programme could prompt the European Union to back US calls for sanctions against the second-biggest oil producer in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.US oil futures hit a high of $63.99 a barrel and settled in New York up $1.63 at $63.94 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the European benchmark, gained $1.63 at $62.70 a barrel.The latest refining stoppages heightened concerns that the system has been pushed too far for too long, especially in the US, and cannot keep pace with growing demand for oil products.George W. Bush, president, on Monday signed a $14.5bn energy bill containing incentives to boost energy production.Mr Bush said the bill would reduce US dependence on foreign oil, which represents about 60 per cent of US consumption. He has also argued that encouraging domestic output would ultimately push prices lower.High petrol prices played an important role in developing the political momentum to win approval for the bill in the US Congress. Many energy experts say, however, that small additions to US output are unlikely to have a significant impact on global energy prices.Meanwhile, a sequence of accidents and lack of spare capacity mean refineries could face difficulties meeting global oil demand this winter. The International Energy Agency, the industrial countries' energy watchdog, has forecast that oil consumption will reach 85.9m barrels a day in the fourth quarter, up from 83.7m b/d today.""The profusion of recent snags in the US refining system suggests that the system is being pushed beyond its sustainable limits and that interruptions are more likely,"" said Kevin Norrish, of Barclays Capital in London."
715;COP;Conocophillips;2005-07-28T20:11:41Z;ExxonMobil production volumes disappoint;;"ExxonMobil on Thursday reported record second-quarter earnings, but analysts said even the full-throttle refining and marketing environment failed to obscure disappointing oil and gas production volumes.The world's biggest publicly listed oil and gas company reported net income of $7.6bn, up 32 per cent from a year ago.However, the consensus forecast had been for earnings per share of $1.24 per share. Excluding a $200m charge for a lawsuit provision, the company earned $1.23 a share. Exxon's shares slipped slightly to $59.49.""Oil and gas production volumes and earnings were disappointing in the quarter, but this was offset by a now-familiar bonanza in the refining and marketing division, particularly in the US,"" said Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse First Boston. ""Chemicals were also weaker than expected.""Exploration and production earnings were $4.9bn, up $1.1bn from the second quarter of 2004, as strong crude and natural gas prices were only partly offset by lower production.However, on an oil-equivalent basis, production fell 4.3 per cent from the year-earlier period. Excluding divestment and entitlement effects, production shrank 2 per cent. Exxon noted that none of this was a surprise: ""Our mature fields continue to perform as expected, and for those fields we operate, maintenance has been as anticipated.""Nonetheless, Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank said: ""The market will not like these volumes."" But Exxon's refining and marketing division yielded strong numbers, tracking ConocoPhillips, which reported on Wednesday, and set the stage for strong refining numbers from Chevron today.Those earnings were $2.2bn, up $714m because of better worldwide refining conditions and throughput. US refineries, in particular, have been running at or near capacity, to meet increasing demand.Although Exxon's chemicals division earned $814m, up $207m, that result was on improved margins offset by lower volumes.With revenue up 25 per cent to $88.6bn, Exxon continued its aggressive buyback programme, purchasing 64m shares for $3.7bn.""More production volume questions for Exxon - and for other big oils - as a big downstream quarter has not masked another disappointing number in oil and gas volumes. Fans of huge share buybacks will cheer today's announcement,"" said Mr Flannery. ""Those looking for progress on production growth will be less happy.""Meanwhile, Marathon, the fourth-largest oil and gas company in the US, beat Wall Street estimates, reporting earnings per share of $2.16, compared with the consensus forecast of $1.57. Net income was $673m, up 91 per cent from the year-earlier quarter, and revenue rose 28 per cent to $16.1bn."
716;COP;Conocophillips;2005-04-27T22:44:09Z;Record profits at Conoco on surging oil price;;"Record oil prices pushed ConocoPhillips' net income 80 per cent higher in the first quarter, enabling the US's third-biggest oil and gas company to pay down debt and pledge to spend $3bn over the next four years to increase refining capacity.ConocoPhillips reported profits of $2.9bn, or $4.10 per share, up from $1.6bn, or $2.33, in the year-earlier period, exceeding the average expectation of analysts of $3.29 a share.ConocoPhillips was the first big US oil and gas company to report, setting the stage for equally strong results from ExxonMobil on Thursday and ChevronTexaco on Friday.""A favourable commodity price environment contributed to strong earnings, cash flows and continued debt reduction this quarter,"" said Jim Mulva, ConocoPhillips' chairman and chief executive. He said the company would have fared even better had it not been for costly maintenance in several countries.Nonetheless, profits were strong enough to enable ConocoPhillips to reduce debt by $1bn in the quarter, leaving $14bn, and improve its debt-to-capital ratio from 26 per cent to 23 per cent.ConocoPhillips generated $4.1bn in cash from operations and spent $1.8bn on capital projects and investments, including the purchase of an additional 1.3 per cent of Russia's Lukoil. It also increased its dividend by 24 per cent and continued to buy back shares.Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank considered it an overall good result, but warned that ConocoPhillips was exposed to political risk in Venezuela. However, he added: ""Risk is well priced in a good play on this consistently strong environment.""In the all-important exploration and production segment, ConocoPhillips reported income of $1.8bn, up from $1.3bn last year. It attributed the improved results primarily to higher crude oil prices.Its refining and marketing division reported income of $700m, up from $464m a year earlier. ConocoPhillips attributed the improvement to increased worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower worldwide marketing margins, reduced volumes and higher turnround and utility costs.The Houston-based company said its stake in Lukoil, its high-profile Russian investment, produced first-quarter income of $110m, up from $74m in the previous quarter because of higher prices and ConocoPhillips' increased equity ownership position, which was up to 11.3 per cent.Mr Mulva expects full-year daily production to be about 3 per cent higher than that produced in 2004."
717;COP;Conocophillips;2005-02-27T15:17:04Z;Shell signs $7bn gas supply deal with Qatar;;Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, on Sunday signed a deal with state-owned Qatargas to build a liquefied natural gas project that will send 7.5m tonnes a year to the fast-growing markets of Europe and North America.The project, called Qatargas-4, is a boost to Shell as it tries to convince sceptical investors that it can secure new energy reserves.Shell was forced to slash its proved reserves five times last year, prompting a shake-up of the company. Linda Cook, head of gas and power at Shell, said the company should be able to start booking the Qatar gas deposits by 2006 or 2007.She expected 2bn barrels of oil equivalent to be produced over the project's life.Shell will own 30 per cent of the new project and Qatargas owning the remainder. The deal, worth up to $7bn (?5.3bn), will also help Qatar in its quest to become the world's largest supplier of LNG, perhaps as early as next year. The country has sought to bring in a group to open new international markets for its gas and reduce its dependence on ExxonMobil, its long-standing partner.On Sunday, the first stone was laid in the world's largest LNG project, Qatargas-2, of which ExxonMobil owns 30 per cent. When it is complete in winter 2007, the $12.8bn project will send 15.6m tonnes of LNG a year to the UK and could eventually supply one-fifth of the nation's gas.Total, the French oil company, was also on Sunday finalising a deal to buy into the Qatargas-2 project and might be able to market up to 5m tonnes a year. The final agreement is due to be announced on Monday.Energy multinationals have been converging on Doha to win stakes to exploit the country's gas resources. LNG is one of the fastest-growing segments of the global energy business, as markets such as the US and Britain start to run out of domestic natural gas supplies.Super-cooling the gas into a liquid allows it to be shipped on tankers, like oil, eliminating the need to build expensive pipelines across unstable parts of the world. Qatar is particularly attractive for the oil majors because of its political stability and vast gas reserves estimated to be the third largest. Qatargas-4, which officials said would be the last LNG plant it would commission for the foreseeable future, attracted intense interest from oil majors.Faisal Al Sawaidi, chief executive of Qatargas, said one-third of the LNG from the project would go to the US, another third to the Iberian peninsula and the remainder most likely to Mexico. Shell, the world's largest private supplier of LNG, aims to double sales by the end of the decade.Additional reporting by James Boxell in London
718;COP;Conocophillips;2005-02-22T21:38:38Z;Wall St slides as oil moves back over $50;;Wall Street suffered its biggest single-day decline of the year on Tuesday, after investor jitters over the rising price of oil and a sharp fall in the dollar sparked a sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 per cent to 10,611.13, and the S&P 500 lost 1.5 per cent 1,184.22 - the biggest single-day fall for both indices since August last year. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4 per cent to 2,030.32.The fall extended the market’s losses from last week, which saw US stocks retreat from year-highs.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said that, in spite of recent dithering, strong corporate profit growth in the fourth quarter and improving expectations for the first quarter meant that stocks were still looking cheap. “Valuations in the market today are no different than they were at the bottom of the market in late 2002 and early 2003,” he said.But Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, said continued earnings strength was far from certain. “A lot depends on where interest rates will be six months from now,” he said, adding that the market would remain sensitive to signs of rising inflation.Pharmaceutical companies took a beating following Monday’s news that Novartis, the Swiss drugmaker, had paid $8bn to snap up Germany’s second-biggest generic drugs group. Merck and Pfizer, two of the biggest US drugmakers, fell 4.3 per cent to $31.20 and 0.8 per cent to $26.59, respectively.Big-name pharma groups have come under pressure from generic competition in recent years. That pressure is expected to mount as patents expire on a raft of name-brand drugs.Energy stocks were among the rare gainers on the S&P 500 yesterday as the price of oil climbed following the cold snap that settled across much of the northern US and Europe at the weekend. Valero Energy, the oil refiner, jumped 1.8 per cent to $66.44. ConocoPhillips, the oil and gasoline group, gave back early gains, however, to close down 0.3 per cent at $105.95.Kerr McGee, the oil and gas producer, received an extra boost after Carl Icahn, the billionaire financier, said he was considering investing up to $1bn in the company. Its shares rose 5.3 per cent to $74.20.But Duke Energy and Dynegy slumped after the US Supreme Court hinted that it might consider reviving a lawsuit brought against the companies for alleged price-fixing during the California energy crisis of 2000-01. Duke shares slipped 2.1 per cent to $26.08, while Dynegy shares fell 4.4 per cent to $4.43.Trading in shares of Winn-Dixie, the grocer, was halted after the company declared bankruptcy. The shares plunged more than 50 per cent in pre-market trading. The company posted a widened quarterly loss this month.Home Depot led decliners on the S&P 500. The home improvement chain slipped 4.1 per cent to $40.28 after its quarterly results landed within their expected range.
719;COP;Conocophillips;2005-02-09T19:47:14Z;Pipeline setback would 'cripple the US';;"The top US energy regulator has warned that some of the world's largest energy producers would “cripple” the US if they failed to move ahead with plans for a $20bn (£11bn) pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska.Pat Wood, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc), said further delays to the 3,500-mile pipeline project which started almost 30 years ago could harm the US, which relies on natural gas for almost a quarter of its energy needs.“We cannot have that gas be sat upon while we just rely on increasing supplies of liquefied natural gas,” Mr Wood told the Financial Times last week. “We need them both, and I think we can do them both.” Ferc on Wednesday published the initial terms governing the design and use of the proposed pipeline from Alaska's North Slope to the US Midwest. Alaska lawmakers are negotiating with prospective builders of the pipeline, although Ferc has ultimate authority over contract terms.The pipeline is a key part of attempts by President George W. Bush to reduce dependence on imported energy. Record gas prices and federal subsidies have rekindled interest in the pipeline but energy companies and officials in Alaska remain divided over access, competition and regulation.Mr Wood said the only significant hurdle was securing agreement from the industry. “Are they ready to start letting it go? Or are they going to sit on it a little longer, until [the market price] goes from $6 to $10? That'll cripple the country,” he said.The main row is between the three energy groups BP, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil that control 95 per cent of Alaska's known gas reserves, and companies with rights to explore and develop larger deposits.The three big producers, also involved in a bid to build the pipe, want lighter regulation for access to the pipeline, which would carry 4bn-4.5bn cubic feet per day. But companies such as Anadarko and Royal Dutch/Shell have called for Ferc to impose tougher rules for setting charges and access to the pipeline to ensure fair access, and to make their potential discoveries economically viable.Mr Wood expects the pipeline to take about 10 years to build, and Ferc has pledged to rule on any application to build it within 20 months.Alternatives include a shorter pipeline through Canada's existing network; an all-Alaska route that sends gas south for liquefaction and transport by sea; and an all-new line directly to the US Midwest."
720;COP;Conocophillips;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Deal is reached over disputed stake in project;;The stand-off between several of the world’s biggest oil companies and the Kazakhstan government moved closer to resolution on Friday after the country’s energy minister said he had reached agreement to buy a disputed stake in the $30bn Kashagan oil field development.A consortium of companies led by Italy’s Eni and consisting of ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, ConocoPhillips and Total - all stakeholders in Kashagan - had agreed to buy BG Group’s 16.7 per cent share for $1.23bn. But the sale was held up after the Kazakhstan government said it had the right to pre-empt the deal and buy the stake itself.Some of the Kashagan consortium members, including Exxon, had raised concerns about the government move but they are now understood to be more supportive. Vladimir Shkolnik, the Kazakh energy minister, said yesterday: “They [the consortium] have finally agreed with us and gave their consent. Thus, the state will buy out 50 per cent of this share.”However, people close to the deal said details would not be agreed or finalised until after talks between the government and consortium members in Kazakhstan on Wednesday. One person close to the talks said BG Group would probably sell its entire stake to the consortium, with the consortium members then selling a half share on to the Kazakh government for about $600m.But two other consortium members warned it was not yet clear how a transaction would be structured and that the sale of the half share was not the only option.BG has been trying to offload its stake for almost two years but has been beset by delays as its original plan to sell to CNOOC and Sinopec, two Chinese oil companies, was blocked by the consortium partners. BG is understood to have insisted its original sales agreement with the consortium members should be honoured.Kashagan is the world’s biggest oil discovery in recent years and is expected to reach peak production of 1.2m barrels of oil per day. Kazakhstan has sought to strengthen deal terms with international oil companies because of concerns that contracts signed in the 1990s were too generous.Kashagan has recoverable reserves of up to 13bn barrels of oil. The Kazakh government is eager to take a stake in Kashagan because it wants to see greater state involvement in the country’s oil bonanza, particularly in the light of recent record crude prices.
721;COP;Conocophillips;2005-01-25T22:55:57Z;Overview: Faltering stocks get fresh boost;;"Some better-than-expected corporate earnings updates breathed fresh life into the world's faltering stock markets on Tuesday and the dollar firmed broadly after US consumer confidence data beat forecasts.Wall Street picked up from its lowest levels since mid-November in morning trade as a busy schedule of fourth- quarter reports from Corporate America at last provided some cheer for investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with its highest single-day gain for the year, up 0.9 per cent to 10,460.16. The Nasdaq Composite gained 10.6 per cent and the S&P 500 put on 0.4 per cent.Yet there was still plenty for the bears to chew over, including this weekend's election in Iraq alongside a key meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna. Next week brings a rate-setting meeting of the US Federal Reserve, which is broadly expected to raise key interest rates by 25 basis points, before finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial nations meet in London on Friday.David Shairp at JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management said the mixed picture painted by recent economic data sat uneasily with the increasingly hawkish tone of speeches by members of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee during the past couple of weeks.""It seems the hawkish are becoming more hawkish, while the dovish are becoming less dovish, but all are playing up the fears of inflation,"" he said.Core inflation, Mr Shairp noted, was currently at 2.2 per cent and was expected to pick up modestly this year.""The Fed has signalled its intentions of hiking rates very clearly - even to those 'desirous of losing money' - and it is unlikely that a faster pace of tightening than 25 basis points per meeting will be pursued in the first quarter.""European equities found encouragement in updates from the British insurer Aviva and Spain's Banco Sabadell, which helped lift the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index 0.7 per cent to 1,054.51.At yesterday's closing level, the Eurofirst was just a couple of points shy of the 29-month high seen in early January.Asian technology stocks were under pressure after the sharp overnight decline on Nasdaq and conflicting signals from LG Electronics, the South Korean consumer electronics group.While regional markets were broadly flat, Tokyo edged lower, hit by the fallout from the chipmaker Elpida Memory, which cut its profit outlook for the year.Hong Kong, by contrast, staged a strong rebound from Monday's 2½-month closing low as investors went bargain-hunting for recently beaten-down property stocks and the bank HSBC. The Hang Seng index rebounded 1.5 per cent.In currency markets the dollar rallied broadly as the rise in US consumer confidence helped to extend earlier gains triggered by indications that China had no plans to revalue its currency in the near future.The US currency also rallied against the Canadian dollar after the Bank of Canada adopted a slightly more dovish tone in a statement that accompanied its widely expected decision to leave interest rates on hold.The dollar rose 1.5 per cent against the yen while the euro dipped 0.7 per cent against the greenback.In commodity markets, Nymex crude oil futures responded to news of a fire at a ConocoPhillips refinery in Louisiana by climbing close to eight-week highs at $49.64. The increase came in spite of forecasts for milder weather in the US and after Kuwait said Opec would leave production unchanged when it met on Sunday."

The same contract on Nymex ended near eight-week highs at $49.64 in New York, up 83 cents.Expectations of better weather in the US put an initial brake on Monday's price increases. WSI Corp, a provider of weather services, said temperatures would be warmer than usual in the northern US from February to April, easing supply concerns. Nymex heating oil futures for February were up slightly on Tuesday at $1.405 a gallon.Gasoline futures on Nymex rose half a cent to $1.343 per gallon following a fire at a Louisiana refinery owned by ConocoPhillips.Supply concerns provided much of the impetus for oil. Iraqi elections and Opec's meeting on January 30 were generating uncertainty.There were increasing signs that Opec would not cut production at the end of the month. The organisation's president and energy ministers from Iran and Nigeria have indicated they do not expect a cut this time round.In addition, Edmund Daukuro, Nigeria's top oil official, said there was a ""consensus"" within Opec to maintain prices within a band of $35-$50 per barrel. Opec's official price band is $22-$28. The Opec basket price stood at $42.49 at midday in New York on Tuesday, up 17 per cent so far this year.Gold fell $5 to $422.10 per troy ounce as stronger consumer confidence data out of the US helped lift the dollar.However, Alan Williamson, precious metals analyst at HSBC, said there was ""increasing evidence that the foundations were being laid for another move higher in the bullion price"".Platinum prices fell back after hitting their highest level since mid-December on Monday. Mr Williamson put the rise down to continuing strength in the South African rand, but said there were ""widespread expectations that the underlying physical market was moving into surplus"". Platinum was trading down $17 at $859 an ounce at 5pm in London yesterday.Cocoa prices could make strong gains this year, according to a Reuters poll of analysts and traders. Benchmark cocoa futures traded on Euronext.Liffe were expected to rise by 17 per cent by the end of 2005, to £983 per tonne. Global demand is expected to outpace supply for the first time in three years, as dry weather in west Africa and possible unrest in the Ivory Coast reduce harvests. Cocoa futures for March delivery were trading at £843 per tonne late on Tuesday, up £4."
723;COP;Conocophillips;2004-12-08T22:03:51Z;Bush urged to accept fuel emissions limits;;The Bush administration and Congress should accept a mandatory programme of tradeable permits to limit greenhouse emissions and tighten fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, according to the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy.The commission which includes leading energy executives, former lawmakers and academics was set up three years ago and aimed to forge a politically viable national energy plan, bridging the gulf between those concerned with the environment and those focused on economic growth.The administration was widely criticised in its first term for failing to canvass a wide range of interest groups before pushing forward its energy plans. Efforts to pass a broad energy bill in the last Congress failed by just two votes in the Senate in November last year. The administration has resisted compulsory limits on emissions in favour of voluntary restraint by industry.Phil Sharp, one of the leading figures on the commission and a former chairman of the House energy subcommittee between 1986 and 1995, said the group's plan would impose mandatory constraints on carbon emissions but would cap the potential cost to industry.“The big barrier to any action of emissions has been concerns in industry that the costs were uncertain and might be too high,” Mr Sharp said. “This side has been winning but our plan meets these concerns.”The commission included leading executives from industries traditionally reluctant to endorse ambitious emission restraints, including John Rowe, chairman and chief executive of Exelon Corporation, Archie Dunham, former chairman of ConocoPhillips, and Martin Zimmerman, former vice-president of corporate affairs at Ford Motor Company.The key recommendations of the commission included a mandatory programme of tradeable permits to limit greenhouse emissions that would cap the initial cost at $7 (€5.2, £3.6) per metric tonne of carbon dioxide.The plan would also tighten fuel efficiency standards for US vehicles. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards were introduced after the 1973-74 oil embargo in an effort to reduce dependence on overseas oil. The standard has essentially been unchanged since 1987. There would also be $3bn spent over 10 years in incentives for carmakers to build efficient hybrid-electric and advanced diesel vehicles.The commission has briefed the White House and Congress leaders, including Pete Domenici, Senate Energy Committee chairman. The committee is expected to draft a new energy bill early next year and Marnie Funk, its spokeswoman, said senators would be receptive to new ideas. However, she was sceptical that measures to tighten fuel efficiency standards could be passed.
724;COP;Conocophillips;2004-10-27T21:27:51Z;US rejects Opec call to free oil reserves;;The US government on Wednesday rejected calls from the president of Opec to release some of its strategic reserves to help reduce oil prices.Purnomo Yusgiantoro, president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and Indonesia's mines and energy minister, said the organisation had asked the White House to use the 670m-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve to “cool” prices at a time when spare production capacity was running at historically low levels.Mr Purnomo said Opec members had also been asked to increase production “to give a signal to the market that we aren't short of supply”.The White House said there had been no discussions about tapping the reserve. President George W Bush has consistently said the SPR will not be used to “manipulate prices”.US oil executives and analysts also insisted that any release would have no effect on prices because refineries were running at capacity, while the reserves themselves are viewed as uncompetitive. “Clearly there is enough crude in the world,” said one analyst.ConocoPhillips, the largest US oil refiner, said US refinery utilisation rose to 93 per cent in the quarter to September 30, while maintenance on infrastructure was above average levels, expected to continue for another three or four weeks.Amerada Hess, which was active in bidding for part of the 30m-barrel release sanctioned by then President Bill Clinton in 2000, also played down the impact of the SPR. John Hess, chairman and chief executive officer, said the group's main supplies from Venezuela and west Africa were more competitive than SPR crude.Mr Purnomo's request marks a departure from Opec's line at the oil cartel's last policy meeting in September, when ministers said the oil market was adequately supplied and there was no supply crisis.The US reported on Wednesday a larger rise than expected in crude oil inventories, which climbed last week by 2.4m barrels to 283.4m barrels, excluding the SPR. But analysts were more focused on the sixth consecutive weekly fall in distillates, used to make products such as heating oil. Reserves were down 500,000 barrels last week, and are now 14.7 per cent below last year.Households and businesses in western industrialised countries will face increases in their heating bills this winter of up to 40 per cent above the last five years' average as prices soar.The last time families faced such a rise was in the 2000-2001 winter and it led to a sharp drop in consumer confidence, depressing retail sales and hitting the Christmas season. Consumer prices also rose sharply.Official data for the European Union and US show retail prices for heating fuels are now up by between 15 and 40 per cent above the same period last year. Analysts said the trend would continue and could worsen over the winter season, which runs from November to March.“We have entered dangerous territory indeed, when all the consumer can do is pray for a mild winter or, failing that, a global economic slowdown,” the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies said.The US Department of Energy forecasts families in the US northeast will pay around $1,220 for heating oil next winter, an increase of 28 per cent above last winter and 51 per cent above the last six-season average. Families in the Midwest, where natural gas is the main heating fuel, will pay $1,000, a 40 per cent increase above the historical average.In the EU, retail prices for heating oil are up 41 per cent on October last year. In Germany, the largest European heating oil market, prices have increased by 46 per cent. This pushed inflation up to 2.1 per cent this month, the highest in nearly three years.Consumers who have postponed rebuilding winter stocks in the hope of lower prices are now proceeding with purchases, adding to price pressure, the International Energy Agency said.With stocks below historic averages, distributors can hardly meet demand. In Europe, the problem has been exacerbated by the surge in diesel demand this summer, as more diesel cars replace petrol vehicles. This has squeezed production of heating oil.“This could limit the market's ability to boost regional heating oil output and meet a potential demand spike, thereby heightening Europe's growing dependence on distillate imports,” the International Energy Agency warned recently.
725;COP;Conocophillips;2004-09-29T20:58:31Z;Wall Street higher as crude retreats;;Wall Street posted modest gains on Wednesday after oil prices retreated from record highs on an unexpected increase in US oil inventories.The S&P500 rose 0.4 per cent to close at 1,114.80 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 10,136.24, recovering from a lower opening. The Nasdaq Composite, buoyed by news of an acquisition in the internet arena, posted a more substantial rise of 1.3 per cent to 1,893.94.The biggest force on the rather listless market was the decline in the price of oil to back below $50 a barrel. Weekly reports on US inventories showed stocks rose by 3.4m barrels, which surprised analysts who had anticipated a decline. In response, the price of crude for November delivery fell 70 cents to $49.20 after hitting $50.47 in Tuesday’s session.Market bulls were also heartened by a handful of bullish corporate news items and an upward revision in the US gross domestic product numbers for the second quarter. The US economy grew at an annual pace of 3.3 per cent in the second quarter, a substantial upward revision from earlier estimates, according to the Commerce Department.Orbitz surged 31 per cent to $27.17 on news that Cendant was near a deal to buy the fast-growing internet travel site. Shares of Cendant retreated 0.4 per cent to $21.93.Biomira soared 35 per cent to $1.57 after the small biotech company said the Food and Drug Administration granted fast-track status to its lung cancer treatment.ConocoPhillips agreed to buy a 7.6 per cent stake in Russian oil producer Lukoil, pulling shares in ConocoPhillips down 2 per cent to $81.57.Boeing shares shed 2.5 per cent to $51.01 after Banc of America downgraded the stock, which has been the best-performing issue in the Dow 30 so far this year. The bank said sales had been weaker than expected and predicts demand will weaken amid the airline industry’s woes.Boeing weighed on the Dow industrials, but the effect was offset by a 1.7 per cent gain in Alcoa, a 2 per cent rise by Intel and a 1.4 per cent rise in Home Depot.Shares of Dow component McDonald’s eased 0.25 per cent on news that chief executive Charlie Bell returned to hospital amid his ongoing battle with cancer.Fannie Mae shares eased another 1 per cent to $66.25 amid continuing fallout from last week’s scathing report on the company’s problematic accounting issued by its regulator.Aside from big moves on a handful of stocks, the mood on Wall Street remained muted as the fiscal year-end machinations of thousands of big mutual funds wound down. More than one third of mutual funds end their fiscal year at the end of September, and managers tend to engage in a fair amount of “window dressing” eleventh-hour buying and selling to make their portfolio look better for their fundholder reports. Year-end window dressing tends to add downward pressure on underperforming stocks and money managers aim to lighten up on the losers for their books.Conversely, the winners tend to get a boost as money managers want to show investors that they have been in on the year’s solid performers. Now that such activity has largely passed, in recent days the market has been moved by massive betting on a rally that often ensues after a presidential election, especially one in which the incumbent wins.“This post-election rally is the most telegraphed move in market history,” said James Altucher, hedge fund manager at Subway Capital. He said Wall Street was positioning itself for a likely victory by President George W.Bush and a removal of uncertainty surrounding the election.However, the fact that everyone is making this bet leads him to believe that “today is the time to buy and election day is the day to sell. I think all the mutual funds positioning themselves to get ahead of the predicted post-election news is what’s going to drive the market from now until election”.
726;COP;Conocophillips;2004-09-29T19:00:21Z;ConocoPhillips to acquire Lukoil stake;;ConocoPhillips on Wednesday agreed to acquire a minority stake in Russia's Lukoil in a landmark deal that could also give the US oil group first-mover advantage in developing Iraq's energy reserves.The third-largest US oil and gas group is the first to take an equity stake in a Russian oil group after winning the auction for the government's remaining 7.96 per cent stake in Lukoil with a bid of $1.99bn. It also plans to acquire an additional 2.4 per cent, and will be allowed to lift its share to 20 per cent.Conoco is also investing in a new joint venture to develop Lukoil's reserves in the Timan-Pechora region of European Russia, and will support Lukoil's bid to validate a disputed contract to develop the west Qurna oilfield in Iraq.The proposed deal is Russia's largest privatisation by value and fills a gap in Conoco's portfolio.Russia contains 11 of the 23 mega-oilfields with potential production of more than 10,000 barrels a day. The west Qurna field is also one of the largest in the world, with proved reserves estimated at about 20bn barrels. While Conoco has been successful in securing oil and gas assets in non-OECD countries to add to its core presence in Alaska and the North Sea its small presence in Russia left it trailing US rivals.ExxonMobil has a large presence in the Sakhalin region in eastern Siberia, and Chevron- Texaco last week signed a wide-ranging alliance with Gazprom, Russia's largest gas group. Chevron has also eyed Sibneft, another Russian oil company, and has been linked with assets belonging to Yukos, the Russian group threatened with break-up.ConocoPhillips agreed to pay the equivalent of $30.76 a share for the Russian government's stake in Lukoil, a fraction above the $1.93bn starting price, and said the proposed deal would be accretive to earnings from 2005. There were two other unidentified bidders represented by Russian banks.Analysts said the move would be seen as a validation of the Russian government's attempts to improve the business and investment climate, in spite of its ongoing battle with the owners and management of Yukos.Jim Mulva, Conoco's president and chief executive officer, has met Vladimir Putin, Russian president, in recent months to discuss its planned investment.Total of France recently confirmed plans to invest about $1bn in a 25 per cent stake in Novatek, one of Russia's largest independent gas producers.
727;COP;Conocophillips;2004-09-29T12:44:49Z;Lex: Lukoil/ConocoPhillips;;"Fortune favours the brave. Buying a minority stake in a Russian oil company, while the government crushes Yukos, certainly appears brave. But will paying $2bn for the government's 7.6 per cent stake in Lukoil bring Conoco-Phillips good fortune?Perhaps not, if a passive investment was the extent of its involvement. Conoco, however, will have board representation. This, plus a governance agreement requiring unanimous board consent for certain key decisions, should limit the scope for abuse.The deal has the “strong support” of the Russian government, and Conoco is allowed to increase its stake to 20 per cent. It is tendering for a further 2.4 per cent of Lukoil's equity. Lukoil's management, however, which owns 21 per cent of the equity, may not be a near-term seller; the Russian oil group could benefit from Conoco's expertise and faster development of its reserves.The strategic aspect of Conoco's involvement has been formalised, after years of discussion, in a joint venture to develop Russia's Timan-Pechora province. Conoco gains access to production growth, while investment in Lukoil's Barents Sea terminal will safeguard an export route. Meanwhile, Lukoil's legal claims to Iraq's West Qurna field might ultimately provide access to that country.The $2bn price tag is attractive in terms of dollars per barrel of reserves. Conoco's approach to increasing Russian exposure amid political uncertainty is a measured one. The deal makes sense."
728;COP;Conocophillips;2004-08-27T12:38:10Z;Lex: Russian oil;;The evisceration of Yukos has not dented the appetite of western companies for Russian oil assets. ConocoPhilips is widely tipped to buy the Russian government’s remaining 7.6 per cent stake in Lukoil.The wisdom of buying a small stake without management control is questionable. Reports that Conoco is interested in building its stake up to 25 per cent, if true, shed a slightly different light.A stake of 25 per cent plus one share would give Conoco a blocking vote. Presumably, recent talks between Conoco and Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, would have addressed the question of a larger stake and future joint-venture expansion. Russia remains a strategic imperative for western oil groups, particularly since research suggests its reserves could prove far larger than estimated.In this regard Lukoil, with a strategy of reserve building rather than production growth, has particular appeal. The trick will be to avoid paying too high a price. The starting price set for the tender, equivalent to $29.83 per share, is close to Lukoil's market value.This price reflects a debt-adjusted cash flow multiple that is below the average for emerging market oil companies. Lukoil's high cost base partly explains the discount and the tender price may yet rise. But the sheer size of Lukoil's reserves makes the prospective price look attractive in terms of dollars per barrel of reserves. Irrespective of political risks, Russia is too big to ignore.
729;COP;Conocophillips;2004-08-26T18:57:09Z;‘Open' auction for Lukoil stake;;The Russian government on Thursday paved the way for the sale to a foreigner of a significant stake in a national oil company when it announced an open auction for its remaining 7.6 per cent stake in Lukoil, seeking offers above $1.93bn.The federal property commission said foreign and offshore-registered contenders would be allowed to compete for its stake alongside Russian groups, in a bidding process scheduled for the end of next month.The action paves the way for one of the most lucrative sell-offs in Russian history and offers the prospect of increased foreign investment in the strategically sensitive energy sector, despite concerns that actions against the embattled oil group Yukos signalled a new hostility to outside ownership.Kiril Tomashchuk, acting head of the property fund, said he had received expressions of interest from ConocoPhilips of the US and David Guggenheim Dabir, a fund.Conoco has already held talks with President Vladimir Putin and Vagit Alekperov, the head of Lukoil, and is believed to be considering a broader partnership with the company through joint ventures as well as purchase of a direct stake in Lukoil, which is quoted in London and Moscow.He appeared to exclude the chances of Rosneft, the state-controlled oil group, from taking part despite fears by some observers that it would form the basis of a powerful new state energy holding company.Mr Tomashchuk said no group with more than a 25 per cent stake controlled by the state could participate.The open auction paves the way for scrutiny of bids by a series of rival contenders, at a time when oil groups are balancing the need for new reserves against concerns that high oil prices are raising sellers' expectations too high. The sell-off of the oil group Slavneft was also held by auction, but widely criticised for excluding all serious contenders except Sibneft and TNK, which bid jointly to win.The reserve bid is the highest ever set in Russia in cash terms, after a 25 per cent stake in the telecoms holding company Svyazinvest of $1.87bn in 1997, and of $1.7bn for 75 per cent of Slavneft in 2002.
730;COP;Conocophillips;2004-08-04T20:17:55Z;Kremlin tightens its control over Russia’s economy;;"On July 22, the day that Yukos, the oil company, warned of its imminent bankruptcy and its main production subsidiary was seized by bailiffs, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, held a meeting with James Mulva, the chief executive of ConocoPhillips, and Vagit Alekperov, the Soviet-era oil boss who now heads Lukoil, Russia's flagship oil company.The president had some good news for Mr Mulva: the government had just signed a decree to sell its 7.6 per cent stake in Lukoil - a private company which represents the Russian state in major international ventures - and signalled that ConocoPhillips was welcome to bid for it. Mr Putin added that he would like to see a more active relationship between Russian and US companies in the energy sector.Investors and traders were confused: should they sell Russian energy stocks because the country's largest oil company was being made bankrupt in violation of shareholders' rights, or should they buy assets because foreign companies were moving in?Of all Russian companies, Yukos has been the most active in seeking foreign investors, while Lukoil has remained cautious about foreign equity partners. But with its seemingly contradictory actions, the government was, in fact, sending a clear message: “we rule”.Having gained almost total political power in the country, Mr Putin and his entourage are proceeding to take control over what Lenin called the “commanding heights” of the economy. This does not mean that Russia is about to start nationalising private business and property or that foreign investment will dry up. It does, however, mean that the Kremlin will decide who can and who cannot invest in Russia. It will increase the state's control over strategic parts of the economy at the expense of the oligarchs who accumulated their wealth through privatisations in the 1990s.Although Yukos was on Wednesday given more breathing space by the justice ministry, which allowed it to pay salaries and to continue operating, there is little doubt that the balance of power is shifting towards more state-oriented companies such as Lukoil.Alexander Radygin, an economist at the Institute for the Economy in Transition, --argued in a recent paper that, over the past four years of Mr Putin's presidency, Russia has been moving towards “state capitalism” where power belongs to the bureaucracy rather than to private business. “The dominant trends of the past few years have been the growing expansion of property interests of the Russian state, an attempt to establish control over capital flows in the Russian economy and a desire to make business dependent on state institutions - despite decisions about deregulation, administrative reform and privatisation plans,” Mr Radygin says.This trend is most visible in the oil and gas industry, which accounts for almost 20 per cent of gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. While the state, and people who identify themselves with it, are also strengthening their positions in banking, telecommunications and media, the attack on Yukos is crucial to both domestic and foreign investors because it shows the limitations of the market economy in Russia.Al Breach, chief economist at Brunswick UBS, the Russian arm of the the Swiss bank UBS, says: “The Yukos affair demonstrates that property rights mean very little in Russia compared to politics. The ownership of assets is contingent on a political regime. If the regime changes so does the property structure.”The investigation of Yukos's taxes was initially interpreted by investors as a by-product of a political brawl between Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Yukos's key shareholder and former chief executive, and the Kremlin. Following Mr Khodorkovsky's arrest, they continued to buy Yukos shares believing the company's integrity was not in doubt. Even when Yukos was presented with a back-tax claim of $3.4bn it was seen as an attempt to rid Mr Khodorkovsky of his wealth. Investors were reassured by Mr Putin's promise that his government would do all it could to avoid the company going bankrupt.But the justice ministry's actions over the past few weeks indicate that the campaign was not aimed at merely curbing Mr Khodorkovsky's political ambitions or ridding him of his wealth. Taking financial control of Yukos, one of Russia's most dynamic oil companies, was at least as powerful a goal.Mr Khodorkovsky, who is standing trial for fraud and tax evasion, has volunteered to give up his shares in Yukos to settle the tax debt. The company has offered the government its stake in Sibneft an oil company, which would have paid for most of the tax arrears. Both offers were ignored. Instead, bailiffs, who are part of the justice ministry seized Yuganskneftegas, Yukos's largest production subsidiary, valued at $30bn, and are preparing it for sale to settle the tax bill. Yevgeny Yasin, a former economics minister, says: “This is the most blatant demonstration that the attack on Yukos has little to do with taxes and everything to do with re-distribution of property and control over the oil industry from independent minded private owners to politically loyal hands.""Mr Yasin says the Kremlin appears keen to have the same degree of control in the oil industry as it already does in the gas sector. Unlike the oil industry, which was largely privatised in the mid 1990s, the gas sector has remained largely in state hands.The reform of Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly, has long been seen as the litmus test of Russia's commitment to market reforms. But on the eve of his re-election as Russian president in March, Mr Putin ruled out its break-up. The government holds 37 per cent in the company and is planning to increase it to 51 per cent. It will be assisted by Alexei Miller, who was appointed by Mr Putin four years ago as chief executive to reassert control. Mr Miller has bought back many of the assets sold or transferred to other companies by the previous managers. Now he wants to go further and build Gazprom into a state-controlled, broad energy holding. The company already owns about 10 per cent of UES, the electricity monopoly, and is in the process of creating an oil business.Reform of UES - headed by Anatoly Chubais, the author of Russia's controversial privatisations of the 1990s - has also been put on ice. According to Mr Chubais's plan, UES should have been divided into power generation companies and sold to private investors while the grid stayed in state hands. But Mikhail Fradkov, the prime minister, has delayed the sell-offs because of unease over who the buyers might be. It seems unlikely in the present political climate that the government would allow the uncontrolled sale of energy assets which could increase the size of the oligarchic groups.While energy remains the backbone of the Russian economy, the state is also strengthening its position in other areas, including banking. The banking sector is still dominated by Sberbank, which has 20,000 branches across the country and holds 62 per cent of all deposits. The central bank is pushing ahead with banking reform but it has no plans for breaking Sberbank's monopoly. “We shall not even think about what to do with Sberbank until 2007,” Andrei Kozlov, a deputy chairman of the central bank, has said.The recent liquidity crisis in the banking system shook public confidence in private banks and bolstered the position of Sberbank and Vneshtorgbank, both state-owned institutions. Problems at Guta Bank, which suspended operations last month, triggered a wave of withdrawals from private banks. Alfa Bank saw an outflow of $240m from retail accounts in just one week. Sberbank reported a net inflow of Rbs10.2bn and Vneshtorgbank, the second largest state bank, not only saw its deposits grow by 9 per cent in July, but took over Guta Bank for Rbs1m and assumed its obligations with $700m of assistance from the central bank. Control of the banking sector gives the government the possibility of allocating capital to any industry of its choice.“Sberbank and Vneshtorgbank give credits to Russia's largest companies and have exclusive access to the biggest and cheapest financial resources - the savings of the populations and deposits of the central bank,"" Mr Radygin of the Institute for the Economy in Transition says.The state appears equally reluctant to give up control over the population's pension savings, despite a provision for future pensioners to transfer some of their savings to a private scheme. “One gets an impression that the real aim of the government was not to reform the pension system but to maximise financial resources under the state control,” Mr Radygin says.Meanwhile, both state-owned and some private companies are urging Mr Putin to exercise tougher control over the market economy. Last week the heads of energy companies Lukoil, Rosneft, Transneft and TNK-BP said in a letter to Mr Putin that “the management and regulation of economic processes in the market economy is a natural and necessary obligation of the state”.The principles of “managed democracy” which has already led to an almost total control of political process by the Kremlin, is now being extended to business. The question is who will manage the commanding heights of the economy?One group that seems well placed to benefit from growing state control is the siloviki - people with a background in security services and the military, many of whom lost out in the1990s. Since Mr Putin's election as president, however, they have managed to penetrate almost every level of the political pyramid. Last week Igor Sechin, the deputy head of Mr Putin's administration who is closely associated with the siloviki, was appointed chairman of Rosneft, the state-owned oil company. Mr Sechin, who acts as a gate-keeper for Mr Putin, is widely believed to be one of the initiators of the attack on Yukos. (Mr Sechin's daughter recently married the son of Vladimir Ustinov, the prosecutor general, who made the case against Yukos shareholders.)Mr Sechin's appointment led many analysts to believe that Rosneft could become the recipient of at least some of Yukos's assets. Another candidate for Yukos's assets is Surgutneftegas, a company tightly controlled by Vladimir Bogdanov, a Soviet-era oil man loyal to the Kremlin and Mr Putin.“Russia is following the path of former Soviet republics such as Azerbaijan or Uzbekistan, where economic wealth is concentrated in the hands of a ruling political clan. Putin may not realise that he is creating a new oligarchy which, once it has enriched itself, will pose a considerable threat to his own authority,” says Olga Kryshtanovskaya, a sociologist who has conducted a study of Mr Putin's political elite. Mr Breach says: “We are moving from a system which was deeply imperfect but tried to live up to the rule of law and market principles, to a system that is more political.”So what are the lessons and implications for foreign investors? The key lesson is the lack of respect for property rights. “What matters is control over the cash-flow, rather than ownership,” says Mr Breach. This poses a serious risk for minority investors in any Russian company. It also means that market capitalisation of Russian companies is likely to remain low compared with their foreign counterparts.Although the oligarchs who enriched themselves during the 1990s privatisations were far from being at the forefront of corporate governance - many of them diluted minority shareholders's stakes and siphoned profits into private bank accounts - over the past decade they transformed outdated Soviet assets into thriving and increasingly transparent businesses. This was well reflected in the growing market capitalisation of the companies.They have also proved their ability to survive the tough and often lawless conditions of Russian business. The siloviki and state bureaucrats have no such record. They have shown little respect for the right of minority shareholders so far - as the Yukos affair demonstrates - and they may be reluctant to open up their business interests to shareholder scrutiny.For strategic investors, the trend towards greater state control of the economy does not mean the end of foreign investment and privatisations, but implies that any merger or acquisition - particularly one involving a foreign company - is impossible without the Kremlin's approval. The sale of assets is likely to take into account the political loyalty of the buyer.Russia will remain an attractive investment for oil companies looking to replace their reserves (see below). But instead of negotiating with the company - as ExxonMobil did when it pursued a stake in Yukos - energy companies are having to talk directly to the Kremlin - as ConocoPhillips did when it formed a partnership with Lukoil.Large foreign companies have plenty of experience of operating in authoritarian environments, such as the Soviet Union in the 1970s and China today. In the short term, state control of the economy could provide stability for foreign companies and reduce their risk of facing aggressive Russian business practices.In the long term, as Mr Breach argues, any system based on the political allocation of resources is prone to crisis, as the collapse of the Soviet Union demonstrated only too vividly.Despite machinations, oil companies pursue dealsThe moves against Yukos by Vladimir Putin, the president, have brought a new level of uncertainty to Russia's oil sector. But for the world's largest international oil companies, the country is too big a prize to let go.Continued turmoil in Iraq, surging demand in China and dwindling production and reserve growth have combined to make oil companies and consumers desperate for oil. And Russia is seen as the country outside Saudi Arabia with the most potential to help meet strong global demand.Oil executives - most of whom are cautious about speaking of Russia's political moves for fear of the Kremlin or giving away their strategy - are uneasy with Moscow's strengthened grip over its oil assets. Nevertheless, they continue to search for opportunities, driven by fierce competition over reserves and concerns that the Kremlin will be likely to allow a limited number of foreign deals. Outside Russia the pickings are slim, with many oil executives believing that the world's large fields have already been discovered. Many of the remaining reserves lie in the Middle East, where regimes such as those in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have kept the doors largely closed to international investment.BP, the world's second largest energy group, is the only big oil company with a corporate deal in Russia - an $8bn joint venture with TNK. Last week, BP revealed that its production would have fallen 7 per cent in the first quarter of this year from last year had it not been for its partnership; instead it reported overall production growth of 18 per cent in the second quarter. Lord John Browne, BP's chief executive, last week said the Yukos affair had had no impact on TNK-BP and that “everything was going in the right direction”. Analysts say that ExxonMobil, the world's largest energy group, which has a relatively small presence in Russia, needs to make the biggest new investment because of its size. It had been looking to link up with Yukos, but analysts now expect Yukos's biggest subsidiary to go to a Russian buyer.Meanwhile, ChevronTexaco has had its eye on Sibneft. In April, France's Total retained bankers to advise them on how to get its hands on a share of the company after Roman Abramovich, its largest shareholder, made clear his eagerness to sell.ConocoPhilips, of the US, is looking to expand its relationship with Lukoil, Russia's second largest oil company. The company says that one of its options is to buy the stake the government intends to sell later this year and augment it with shares bought from Lukoil's top management.Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's third largest energy group, already has its biggest single direct investment in Russia's Sakhalin region. “We are keeping an eye on what happens and are thinking through whether those opportunities are available to us.” says Malcolm Brinded, head of the company's exploration and production.The large number of suitors -and a record high oil price have given Mr Putin the opportunity to play coy. He did, however, welcome potential US investors when he met James Mulva, head of ConocoPhilips, last month. “I would like to see relations between Russian and US businesses develop more actively,” he said. While Mr Putin has not made it easy for foreign investors, industry observers say Russia needs the oil companies to develop its resource base. “Without advanced technology it would not be possible for Russia to reach its full production potential,” says Stewart Johnston of Charles River Associates, industry consultants.The US has made clear that it wants to form a strategic partnership with Russia to reduce America's dependence on the Middle East. But Spencer Abraham, US secretary of energy, has told Mr Putin that some of his recent decisions, including the threat to revoke ExxonMobil's exploration license in eastern Siberia, could dampen US investor interest. Mr Putin has yet to go as far as the leaders of many of the world's biggest oil-rich states when they nationalised their oil industries between 1960 and 1980. But his slow progress in authorising foreign investment for oil has delayed supplies the world needs.Carola Hoyos"
