0;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2019-12-03T17:27:49Z;Deutsche Bank ordered to disclose Trump financial records;Ruling by federal appeals court sets the stage for battle before US Supreme Court;Donald Trump suffered yet another legal defeat on Tuesday in his battle to protect his finances from scrutiny as Deutsche Bank was ordered to disclose his records to Congress.The decision on Tuesday by a federal appeals court in New York adds to a string of cases that will probably be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, which Mr Trump has asked to support his claims of immunity from investigation.Mr Trump has seven days to appeal the panel’s ruling, which rejected the president’s bid to block subpoenas from the Democrat-led House intelligence and financial services committees.“The public interest in vindicating the committees’ constitutional authority is clear and substantial,” wrote Jon Newman, a senior judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr Trump, said: “We are evaluating our next options including seeking review at the Supreme Court.” The president has already appealed two other court decisions involving his financial records to the Supreme Court.Democrats issued the subpoenas in April to Deutsche Bank and Capital One as part of their investigations into illicit money flows and foreign influence in US politics. Mr Trump sued the lenders to block their compliance with the orders.The subpoenas cover a broad swath of financial records relating to Mr Trump, his family and his companies. Both Deutsche Bank and Capital One have said they do not hold Mr Trump’s tax returns, but the German bank said it does have some tax returns for other individuals or entities covered by the subpoena.A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said on Tuesday the lender was “committed to providing appropriate information to all authorised investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations”. Capital One declined to comment.Mr Trump is battling Congress in a separate case in which the House oversight committee sought his tax records from Mazars USA, the president’s accountant. The Supreme Court issued a stay of the Democrats’ subpoena in that case while it considers a forthcoming appeal.He is also fighting the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which has sought records from Mazars as part of a criminal investigation it is conducting. Mr Trump has appealed that case to the Supreme Court.Across the cases, Mr Trump has asserted a broad view of presidential immunity from scrutiny and challenged the right of Congress or prosecutors to investigate him. He has been supported, to varying degrees, by the US Department of Justice.Mr Trump’s arguments have largely been rejected by the courts so far, with some judges arguing they run against fundamental constitutional principles.The Supreme Court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority, including two of Mr Trump’s appointees, has yet to announce whether it will take up the cases but has been urged by the president to rule in his favour.
1;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2019-08-27T22:03:23Z;Deutsche Bank says it has Donald Trump-related tax returns;Democrats subpoenaed German lender for personal, family or business filings;Deutsche Bank is in possession of tax returns filed by President Donald Trump, his family or his businesses, according to a letter the German lender filed with a US court on Tuesday afternoon.A federal appeals court in New York is hearing Mr Trump’s appeal of a lower-court ruling, which declined to block subpoenas from the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives committee on financial services. The committee is seeking a range of financial documents from Deutsche and a US bank, Capital One Financial.Which members of the Trump family, or which Trump business, filed the returns in Deutsche’s possession remains unclear because the bank redacted that information from the public version of the letter, providing the full details only under seal.“The bank has in its possession tax returns (in either draft or as-filed form) responsive to the subpoenas for [redacted],” the letter said. The bank also had documents “related to parties not named in the subpoenas but who may constitute ‘immediate family’ within the definition provided in the subpoenas”.In his lawsuit against the two banks, intended to prevent the release of documents, Mr Trump is joined by his sons Donald and Eric, his daughter Ivanka and several related entities including The Trump Organization.Mr Trump is pursuing parallel litigation against Mazars USA, his accounting firm, which has also been subpoenaed by Congress.Capital One, in a separate letter, said that it did not possess any tax returns “responsive” to the subpoenas. Mr Trump’s lawyers have stated that the president and his family have numerous accounts with both banks.Defending the redaction of the names, the Deutsche letter noted that US law prohibits banks from disclosing customers’ personally identifiable financial information to third parties, with only limited exceptions for judicial requests. Because tax returns are only required for certain types of banking activity, the letter argued, revealing the possession of them for a particular client would amount to releasing such information.The letter also referred to contractual confidentiality agreements with clients, and the legal precedent for filing sensitive documents under seal. The subpoenas themselves have not been made public.Last week Deutsche and Capital One declined to tell the appeals court’s three-judge panel whether they were in possession of the returns. The court subsequently ordered the banks to provide the information, or explain why they were declining to answer.Mr Trump’s lawyers have argued that the subpoenas are illegitimate in that they serve no legitimate legislative purpose and are designed only to “rummage through every aspect” of the president’s finances and “ferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage”. The lower court judge, Obama administration appointee Edgardo Ramos, disagreed, saying that “the power of Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process”.
2;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2019-08-01T21:03:11Z;Republicans launch inquiry into data breaches;House panel requests briefings with Capital One and Amazon over nature of information stolen;Republicans on the House oversight and reform committee have launched an inquiry into Capital One and Amazon over a massive data breach uncovered this week, in a sign of mounting political scrutiny of the companies’ cyber security practices.In two letters published on Thursday, the committee requested a “staff-level briefing” with the two companies within the next two weeks in relation to the breach, in which 106m credit card holders and applicants in the US and Canada had sensitive data stolen from the bank by a hacker.The accused hacker, a computer systems engineer named Paige Thompson, had previously worked at Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing service where the Capital One data were stored. She was arrested on Monday over the hack and charged in a criminal complaint.Capital One said that the hacker stole the data in March this year, but the company did not discover the data theft until it was alerted by a third party in July.In a letter addressed to Richard Fairbank, Capital One’s chief executive, the committee demanded more details on the scope and nature of the breach, as well as the bank’s response, “to help us more fully understand Capital One’s recent incident and its potential to affect millions of Americans”.Writing separately to Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive and founder, the group asked for information on “the current status of AWS security protocols in place to ensure the security of sensitive personal and government data”. The letter noted that AWS is to provide data storage for the 2020 US census and is in the running for the Department of Defense’s cloud computing contract.The $10bn Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract, known as Jedi, is meant to transfer much of the Pentagon’s data storage and processing to the cloud. On Thursday, the Pentagon said Mark Esper, secretary of defence, would review the contract. Elissa Smith, a defence department spokesperson, said “no decision” would be made until Mr Esper had “completed his examination”.The committee inquiry comes after New York’s attorney-general announced a probe into the breach earlier this week.“We have proactively engaged in discussions with lawmakers and elected officials since the arrest of the perpetrator of this cyber incident on Monday and will continue to do so,” a Capital One spokesperson said on Thursday.Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.However, the company said earlier this week that no AWS infrastructure or services were compromised in the Capital One breach.Instead, the bank used its own web application to access its data in the cloud, which Ms Thompson was able to breach due to a “firewall misconfiguration”, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case. It is unclear whether the hacker may have had other targets. Researchers have said that there were indications that Ms Thompson may have also stolen data from Italian bank UniCredit and carmaker Ford, both of which said on Wednesday that they had launched internal investigations.Vodafone was also flagged by cyber security researchers, but said that it was “not aware of any information” relating to the breach.On Thursday, the New York department of financial services said that it had been contacted by UniCredit about “the possible loss of consumer data related to the Capital One data breach” and was examining the matter.
3;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2019-08-01T10:39:07Z;Capital One/Amazon: hack sore;Data breaches raise questions about cloud computing but won’t slow down growing market;The cloud is more physical than it sounds. Data stored with third-party providers such as Amazon Web Services requires powerful servers. The security of data centres is the responsibility of these businesses. The security of the data itself is shared between providers and corporate customers. These include US credit card issuer Capital One, where a huge data breach has affected more than 100m people.This distinction means there is no reason to regard the cloud as more risky than on-site servers. Broadly, AWS takes responsibility for the cloud and customers take responsibility for what is in it. The Capital One hacker seems to have used the group’s web app to access data stored with AWS.On Wednesday, companies including Italy’s UniCredit announced they were trying to work out whether the hacker had accessed their data as well. The suspect arrested in connection with the data theft — once an AWS employee — does not seem to have done anything with the information apart from brag about it online. This is unlikely to stop a regulatory investigation. Yet no company has suggested that there is a problem with the cloud.Cloud fans say the breach could have happened just as easily if the data were held in an on-site server. Guggenheim says the movement of large quantities of data might then have been more noticeable. But this cannot be proved.Still, customers wrestling with a shift to the cloud may find a hybrid service that blends on-site equipment with public cloud services more alluring. Amazon, by far the biggest cloud provider with a business accounting for more than half the company’s operating income, announced its own hybrid service late last year.Customers gain computing power and reduce costs by moving to the cloud. By 2020 the market is expected to be worth $191bn, says analyst company Forrester — doubling in size in just five years. Hacks will trigger calls for improved cyber security. They will not slow down the pace of adoption.Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly. Please sign up here
4;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2019-07-30T22:27:49Z;Capital One data breach sparks cloud security fears;US bank’s shares slide nearly 6% on fallout from hack affecting over 100m customers;Revelations of a massive data breach at Capital One Financial have prompted an investigation from New York’s attorney-general and renewed concerns over cyber security in the cloud.The US bank said on Monday that about 100m credit card holders and applicants in the US and 6m in Canada had their personal information stolen, marking one of the largest data thefts to hit a financial services company.The alleged hacker, a computer systems engineer named Paige Thompson, was arrested on Monday. She previously worked at Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing service where the Capital One data were stored. News of the breach sent Capital One shares down 5.9 per cent to $91.21 on Tuesday.Letitia James, New York state attorney-general, said in a statement on Tuesday that her office would begin a probe immediately and would work to ensure that any affected New Yorkers are provided relief. “Though Capital One’s breach was internal, the fact still remains that safeguards were missing that allowed for the illegal access of consumers’ names, social security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, and other highly sensitive, personal information,” Ms James said. “We cannot allow hacks of this nature to become everyday occurrences.”Among those, about 1.1m Canadian social insurance and US social security numbers and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were accessed in the hack, which took place in late March, Capital One said.The disclosure comes at a critical moment for Amazon, as it woos businesses in highly regulated industries such as banking and healthcare to move sensitive information from so-called on premise physical data centres to its lucrative cloud service, promising lower costs and improved productivity.Amazon Web Services, the largest provider of cloud services, is the ecommerce company’s most profitable arm, bringing in $2.1bn in operating income in the second quarter on $8.4bn in sales.Richard Fairbank, Capital One’s chief executive, had been among the most outspoken advocates for moving to cloud services, with the company stating in an annual shareholder meeting that it was “all-in on the cloud”.But some companies have been wary of making the transition, following a number of high-profile security incidents.We cannot allow hacks of this nature to become everyday occurrencesIn this instance, Capital One used its own web application to access its data in the cloud, and it was that application that Ms Thompson breached due to a “firewall misconfiguration”, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case. Amazon says customers control their own web applications and that no AWS infrastructure or services were compromised. “This is one more thing that makes people feel more cautious about a move to the cloud and will cause additional risk assessment,” said Joseph Blankenship, research director for security and risk at Forrester, the market research company.The breach should serve as a warning to companies that moving to the cloud can add complexity, some experts said.“Those who build an app usually aren’t involved in configuring the storage or networking,” said Michael Farrell, co-director of the Institute for Information Security & Privacy at Georgia Tech. “Understanding the details of liability, let alone who has technical responsibility for what when it comes to cloud applications is very important.”And he added: “Capital One and AWS have been proud public partners, touting cloud success . . . But the finger-pointing in this wake of this breach reminds us that reading the fine print in contracts and minding the details of technical configurations are critical.”The hacker, Ms Thompson, appeared in court on Monday in Seattle charged with one count of computer fraud and abuse, court records show.On her Twitter profile, she described herself as a 33-year-old living in Seattle and spoke of issues with her mental health. Her online resume said she worked at AWS from May 2015 to September 2016.According to an affidavit by Joel Martini, an FBI special agent, authorities were led to her after she appeared to boast about the hack online using the alias “erratic”, telling an unnamed person: “I’ve basically strapped myself with a bomb vest . . . dropping capital ones dox and admitting it.” That unnamed person went on to alert Capital One on July 17 that its customer data appeared to be on GitHub, the code repository.Capital One confirmed the findings in an internal investigation two days later, and said on Monday that it “immediately fixed the configuration vulnerability” and began working with law enforcement. “Based on our analysis to date, we believe it is unlikely that the information was used for fraud or disseminated by this individual. However, we will continue to investigate,” Capital One said. The company said it would notify those affected and make “free credit monitoring and identity protection” available to them.The incident would generate “incremental costs of approximately $100m to $150m in 2019” to cover the notification of customers, credit monitoring and technology and legal costs, it said.But experts warn the company could be on the hook for more.There would be a “material impact if this person shared [the data] anywhere else or made it available for others to access”, Mr Blankenship at Forrester said.Additional reporting by Kadhim Shubber in Washington
5;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2019-07-30T02:40:05Z;Capital One data breach affects 106m people;US bank says details of credit card customers and applicants were exposed;Capital One, the US bank, said on Monday that it had suffered a massive data breach, reporting that an outside hacker obtained the personal data of more than 100m customers and applicants for its credit cards.About 100m individuals based in the US and 6m in Canada had their information compromised in the breach, according to a statement by Capital One, which is among the top credit card issuers in America.The breach took place in late March but was not discovered until this month, the company said, adding that it would notify those affected and make “free credit monitoring and identity protection” available to them.The alleged hacker, Paige Thompson, was arrested on Monday and appeared in court in Seattle, according to court records. Prosecutors have moved to keep her in jail ahead of her trial.She was charged with one count of computer fraud and abuse.$100-150mCapital One’s estimate of the incremental costs of the breachMs Thompson worked as a systems engineer at an unnamed cloud computing company from 2015 to 2016, according to an FBI affidavit filed in her case. Her online resume said she worked at Amazon Web Services from May 2015 to September 2016. Amazon Web Services declined to comment.The data theft revelations come just days after the credit reporting agency Equifax agreed to pay almost $800m in a record US settlement after a 2017 hack that exposed the personal data of close to 150m people.In the case of Capital One, the hacker largely tapped the personal information of consumers and small businesses that applied for credit card products between 2005 and 2019, collecting names, addresses and phone numbers, self-reported income, credit scores and payment history, among other personal information.About 1.1m Canadian social insurance and US social security numbers* and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were also accessed, Capital One said.The bank added that it expected the incident to generate “incremental costs of approximately $100m to $150m in 2019” to cover the notification of customers, credit monitoring and technology and legal costs.Capital One said that it was alerted by an outside researcher of the breach on July 17 and confirmed the findings on July 19.According to the affidavit by Joel Martini, an FBI special agent, Ms Thompson used the alias “erratic” online. The affidavit quoted several online posts by “erratic” that appeared to refer to the stolen Capital One information.In one message on June 18, “erratic” told an unnamed person who reported the breach to Capital One: “I’ve basically strapped myself with a bomb vest, dropping capital ones dox and admitting it.”According to the affidavit, the person told Capital One on July 17 that its leaked data appeared to be on GitHub, the code repository.A federal public defender assigned to Ms Thompson’s case did not immediately return an email seeking comment on Monday evening.“Capital One quickly alerted law enforcement to the data theft — allowing the FBI to trace the intrusion,” said Brian Moran, the US attorney for the western district of Washington.The bank’s shares fell more than 4 per cent in after-hours trading on the news to $93.Additional reporting by Shannon Bond in San Francisco*This article has been amended since original publication to clarify that the 1.1m figure includes Canadian social insurance and US social security numbers.
6;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2019-07-21T09:46:24Z;US banks boosted by rise in credit card spending;Second-quarter results show quickening growth in purchases;US shoppers increased their credit card spending in the second quarter, giving a welcome boost to card issuers and adding to the debate about the financial health of consumers.Companies from JPMorgan Chase and Capital One to Synchrony Financial have reported growth in card spending in the three months to June that eclipsed figures for the first quarter.American Express chief executive Stephen Squeri said in a call with analysts last week that the spending was happening “[against] the backdrop of an economy that is growing at a steady if more modest pace relative to 2018”. Amex said spending by its card members was up 8 per cent from the second quarter of 2018, an acceleration from the year on year growth of 7 per cent in the first-quarter.Amex is the second-largest card issuer by purchase volume, according to the Nilson Report, after JPMorgan, which reported an acceleration in spending growth from 10 per cent in the first quarter to 11 per cent in the second.Of the major issuers that have reported results in the past week — a group that also includes Citigroup and Bank of America — all reported faster spending growth in the second quarter than in the first.Jennifer Piepszak, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, was asked about the growth in card spending volume on the bank’s earnings call. “I would say that [the business is] firing on all cylinders. So [are] its brand, its people, its products. It does certainly help to have the backdrop of a healthy US consumer as well and, in fact, retail sales this morning looked strong. So we can expect that to continue,” she said.Retail sales figures in the US have been mixed this year, though they showed a fourth consecutive month of growth in June. Expanded use of credit cards could reflect consumer confidence or signal that consumers are having to borrow money to maintain spending levels.The amount of debt that Americans are holding or “revolving” in their credit card accounts has picked up in recent months, as well. Total revolving consumer debt rose 8 per cent in April and May from the year before, hitting $1.07tn, according to the Federal Reserve. That is in contrast to the first quarter, when the growth in revolving balances rose only 1.5 per cent.The last two months aside, the recent trend has been moderate growth in revolving balances, argued Brian Riley of Mercator Advisory. “The US consumer is fine — that’s the backdrop.” Mr Riley said. “The fact that spending is up and is not being pushed into revolving [balances] is a healthy sign.”The number of accounts overdue by more than 30 days rose slightly in the second quarter at both Amex and Capital One.But Richard Fairbank, chief executive at Capital One, noted that growth in card purchase volume had outstripped the rise in card loans in the second quarter.
7;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2019-04-30T04:14:38Z;Trump sues Deutsche Bank and Capital One to stop release of financial records;President and his children move to stymie congressional investigation into financial affairs;"US president Donald Trump has sued Deutsche Bank and Capital One in a bid to stop them from handing over financial records in response to congressional subpoenas issued by Democrats.Mr Trump filed the suit late on Monday in a federal court in New York to stop the banks giving Congress years of records about his business dealings. The move is the latest attempt by the president to frustrate efforts by Democrats to dig into his personal affairs.The lawsuit asked the court to declare invalid the subpoenas from the House intelligence and financial services committees, and prevent Deutsche Bank and Capital One from complying with them. The president was joined in the suit by his sons Donald and Eric, his daughter Ivanka, who is also a White House adviser, and several related entities, including the Trump Organization.The filing claimed the subpoenas were issued to “harass” Mr Trump and “to ferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage”.“No grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one,” said the filing.Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday: “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorised investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.”Capital One did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The move by Mr Trump was the latest salvo in a battle between the president and Democrats in the House of Representatives who are investigating his administration and his business dealings.Earlier this month Mr Trump sued Mazars USA, his accounting firm, and Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the House oversight committee, after Mr Cummings issued a subpoena to the firm for records regarding the president.Democrats are also seeking Mr Trump’s tax records, using a law that gives the House ways and means committee the right to access any individual’s tax returns. The Trump administration has missed two deadlines to hand over the president’s tax filings.This lawsuit is not designed to succeed; it is only designed to put off meaningful accountability as long as possibleLast week, Mr Trump made clear his intention to resist requests for records from Democrats in Congress, telling reporters: “We’re fighting all the subpoenas.”Maxine Waters, chair of the House financial services committee, and Adam Schiff, who chairs the House intelligence committee, said in a joint statement on Monday that Mr Trump’s latest lawsuit was “meritless”.“This lawsuit is not designed to succeed; it is only designed to put off meaningful accountability as long as possible,” they said.Ms Waters and Mr Schiff had issued subpoenas earlier this month to Deutsche Bank and other banks as part of their investigations into illicit finance and foreign influence in US politics.Mr Trump’s lawsuit said the subpoenas to Deutsche Bank sought a broad sweep of banking and financial records about himself, his family and his businesses stretching bank to 2010. For some types of records, such as account applications, the subpoenas placed no time limitation, according to the lawsuit.Both Deutsche Bank and Capital One had intended to begin handing over documents in response to the subpoenas by May 6, the lawsuit said.Mr Trump’s relationship with Deutsche Bank has been a key area of focus for congressional investigators, particularly after Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, told Congress that documents Mr Trump submitted in connection with a potential loan in 2014 had “inflated” his wealth.Mr Cohen is due to begin a three-year prison term in May for crimes including campaign finance violations, lying to Congress and tax evasion.Deutsche Bank has been a longtime lender to Mr Trump, continuing to work with him even after other financial institutions were put off by a spate of Trump business bankruptcies in the 1990s."
8;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2019-01-23T18:34:22Z;End to Walmart dispute puts Synchrony on track for best day ever;;Synchrony Financial was heading toward its best day ever on Wall Street after extending a credit card deal with Sam’s Club and announcing that Walmart dropped a lawsuit against the bank.Walmart announced in July it had selected Capital One Financial as its new credit card partner, ending an exclusive deal with Synchrony that dated back nearly 20 years. Walmart later filed a lawsuit in November accusing Synchrony of breaching its agreement with the retailer. Synchrony had called the complaint “baseless.”Synchrony said Wednesday that Walmart agreed to dismiss the lawsuit, which had sought $800m in damages.The bank also reached separate agreements to sell its existing Walmart loan portfolio to Capital One and extend its deal to service credit cards for members of Sam’s Club, the Walmart-owned warehouse chain.“We are very pleased to have reached these agreements. Obtaining certainty around the Walmart portfolio and a renewal on Sam’s Club is a great outcome for the company,” Synchrony chief executive Margaret Keane said in a statement.The company also renewed a credit-card partnership with Amazon and extended and expanded its relationship with Qurate Retail Group, the parent company of HSN and QVC. The news coincided with Synchrony’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which showed a higher profit that beat Wall Street’s forecast.Shares leapt 10.4 per cent to $29.29 in recent trading, setting a pace to record the stock’s largest one-day gain since going public in 2014.The bank, a former unit of GE Capital, issues private-label credit cards for retailers including JCPenney, Gap and Lowe’s. Walmart had accounted for more than one-tenth of Synchrony’s total interest and fees on loans in 2017.Synchrony said it expects to transfer the $9bn in Walmart card balances to Capital One late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter.Capital One shares were down more than 5 per cent after reporting weaker fourth-quarter earnings than expected. During a conference call with analysts, chief executive Richard Fairbank said the portfolio has “high credit loss” but Capital One’s share of credit losses is “fixed at a low percentage throughout the partnership.”
9;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2018-10-23T18:41:29Z;Capital One fined $100m over anti-money laundering controls;;The Office of the Comptroller of The Currency, one of the primary US bank regulators, has fined Capital One $100m in response to shortcoming in Capital One’s Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs.Capital One — a leading credit-card issuer with nearly $300m in assets — received a consent order from the OCC in 2015 which detailed weaknesses in the bank’s compliance, risk assessment and suspicious activity reporting systems. A statement from the OCC said: “In assessing this civil money penalty, the agency found that the bank failed to achieve compliance with . . . OCC’s 2015 order, as required.”A Capital One representative said: “Our consent order with the OCC anticipated a future civil money penalty. The penalty imposed today is part of the resolution of that previously disclosed order. We have made significant progress against the terms of that order.”Many US banks have received consent orders from the OCC concerning the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering. In January, the OCC fined Citigroup $70m for failing to take sufficient action in response to a consent order it received in 2012.
10;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2018-10-17T17:12:03Z;US banks: follow the money;Credit card and car loan specialists will reveal financial woes of typical consumers;There is a rigid class system governing the US banks’ earnings season. First out of the gate is JPMorgan Chase, the number one by assets, run by the crown prince of the industry. Then come the rest of the megabanks, followed by big regionals such as BB&T and SunTrust. Bringing up the rear are specialists in credit cards and car loans, such as Capital One, Ally and Discover.For the best read on the strains facing the typical US consumer, wait for these laggards. Trillion-dollar banks such as Citi have moved determinedly upmarket since the crisis, trying to persuade regulators that they are steering well clear of the kinds of customer who got them into trouble more than a decade ago. Partly for this reason, major banks have reported pristine consumer loan books over the past week, even as several interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve have pushed up the cost of floating-rate credit.US Bancorp continued that theme on Wednesday, as the number five bank by assets became the latest to beat analysts’ profit forecasts. Non-performing assets as a proportion of total loans at the Minneapolis-based bank was 0.36 per cent, down one-fifth from a year earlier.When Cap One and peers report next week investors will get a better look at blue-collar America, which depends more than ever on debt to bridge gaps between income and spending. Cracks are emerging. In credit cards, for example, where Americans have a near-record $830bn in revolving balances, the amount of debt more than 90 days’ delinquent has been rising for the past year.Meanwhile, prices for used cars and trucks fell 3 per cent month-on-month in September, matching the biggest drop since the 1960s, suggesting that lenders will fall short on recoveries if borrowers default. Santander Consumer, the biggest subprime car loan provider, announced this week that net charge-offs across its securitisation platforms were up by 88 basis points in September — a deterioration about 25 per cent worse than normal for the month. If trouble really is brewing, you will see it in this group of lenders first.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

11;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2018-10-15T03:00:26Z;Not every company is a technology company;Solid, long-established corporate names are confusing customers with sector-fluidity;Rather than adopting the hackneyed advice to think outside the box, companies often take a different tack: they relabel the box.The most common way of doing this used to be to declare that what was a carmaker, insurance company, or bank was now a technology company.Under Armour, which makes sportswear, Jaguar Land Rover, which makes vehicles, and financial institutions such as Capital One, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have made such statements in recent years. “Anybody that’s going to live in the future better be [here],” said Under Armour’s chief executive Kevin Plank when asked to explain his presence at the tech-heavy Consumer Electronics Show in 2016.JPMorgan took this ambition a step further last week when it said it was giving new investment bankers and asset managers coding lessons, in the hope they would learn to “speak the same language as our technology teams, which ultimately drives better tools and solutions for our clients”.Whether teaching coding will achieve such goals is a subject for another column. But whether JPMorgan and Under Armour are technology companies is an easy question to answer. They are not.Or rather, if they are, then only in the sense that all companies must understand and invest in technology.If anything, the ubiquity of tech is rendering old categories meaningless.Very occasionally, a company is genuinely misunderstood, often for deep historical reasons. Until it sold its sugar and syrup business in 2010, Tate & Lyle struggled to convince analysts that it was in fact a high-tech ingredients producer. One former chief executive went so far as to sport a suit made from corn-based fabric, to show off the group’s science-based strategy.There are also a few practical reasons for companies to emphasise their tech strengths. As dependency on advanced technology increases, everyone competes for the same developers and programmers. Traditional companies are bound to search for a little more clout in the jobs market against obvious tech heavy-hitters such as Google or Facebook.Mostly, though, the reasons for dressing in technology’s clothes are less edifying. Some companies simply calculate the sector’s stock market glamour will rub off on their own securities. As the recent volatility of US technology stocks has shown, this is far from a one-way bet.At its extreme, the hunt for a hot sector can lead to such shape-shifting absurdities as the renaming of humdrum manufacturers as go-go dotcoms in the 1990s or the more recent pivot of tea brewers, biotech companies, sports bra makers and others into pioneers of blockchain.In the early 2000s, some companies fighting against growing opposition to stock option perks lobbied to be reassigned to the technology sector, in the hope their lavish grants of options would look less outlandish when compared with Silicon Valley. According to an insider, one traditional industrial company even argued it was a technology company because it had a website.This sort of quest often ends in retreat, restructuring and regret.A more solid strategic approach is to buy into the sector — witness legacy banks’ takeovers of fintech stars. But a company that merely tries to pass itself off as something it is not risks annoying, or worse, confusing, its front-line staff and customers. Common sense says most users of banks, carmakers and athletic wear want to save or borrow money, to buy a reliable car, or to find some comfortable leggings. If they start to worry about how the technology works, it has either gone wrong ( banks, please note), or is somehow obscuring the core product.The trend towards sector fluidity is unlikely to slow down. Even the boxes into which companies were once placed are being shuffled. S&P Dow Jones Indices has just moved multiple stocks, including Google’s parent Alphabet and Facebook, out of the “information technology” sector and into “communication services”.“We started thinking how different companies use Facebook and the answer was: ‘They communicate through it’,” explains David Blitzer, who heads the S&P DJI index committee.This matters most for investors’ industry-weighted portfolios. But the sector is so broad — it embraces telecoms groups such as AT&T, advertising agencies and computer game makers — that it allows for even more change in years to come.These days, we talk to the technology hidden in our phones, our cars, our banks, our shops and our household appliances. They talk back.Pretending to be a technology company is so yesterday. Anybody who’s going to live in the future better be in communication services.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghillIf you can’t beat the tech companies you have to join them / From Patrick Neill, Dublin, Ireland
12;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2018-08-20T08:00:25Z;US banks tap the brakes on consumer credit;Spending is up, but concern is growing over credit quality and profitability;"This is a good time to offer Americans credit. Economic growth is solid, unemployment is low, and wallets are open.In July, retail sales grew at a sturdy 6 per cent from the year before, faster than analysts had expected. The prosperity extends even to dowdy brick-and-mortar stores: Macy’s, the struggling department store chain, last week posted its third straight quarter of sales growth after several years of declines. Walmart, the vast discount retailer, reported its best quarterly sales growth in 10 years. At the other end of the price spectrum, Nordstrom, the upscale department store chain, reported a big jump in sales which drove its stock up 13 per cent.Nor does the spending seem to be especially reckless. When, at the beginning of last year, household debt surpassed its last peak, in 2008, many pundits speculated about the possibility of a new financial crisis. But US household debt — all $13.3tn of it, according to the New York Fed — is much lower, relative to both GDP and disposable income, than it was in the run-up to 2008.The big card-issuing banks are pleased. In second-quarter calls with analysts, JPMorgan highlighted that consumer purchases using their cards were up 11 per cent; Bank of America’s purchase growth was almost as high. Citigroup and Capital One pointed out loan balances were growing nicely.If the card business is picnic, though, it is a late summer picnic; the watermelon has already been served, and the skies are showing the early signs of darkening. The card issuers acknowledge that, as US consumers have gotten their mojo back, the competition for their business has become very competitive indeed. Savvy Millennials shuffle between cards to maximise rewards and introductory interest rates. Big spenders with good credit ratings are the prize in a “ rewards war”.At the same time, the current economic expansion, at the grand old age of nine years, is the second longest on record. That does not provide any particular reason to think it is near an end. But trees do not grow to the sky.$8bnQuarterly bad credit card debt write-off in 2018The competitive heat and the length of the cycle are making themselves felt in industry-wide data. Measure of credit quality, while not flashing amber, are unmistakably headed in the wrong direction.Quarterly write-offs of bad credit card debt at US banks peaked at nearly $19bn in the first quarter of 2010 and bottomed under $5bn in 2015, according the FDIC. Since then they have crept back over $8bn.The rate at which credit card holders are falling delinquent, while still at a low level, has also been creeping up since 2015. Bankers dismiss these trends as the natural “seasoning” of credit card loan portfolios that have been rebuilt since the recovery. But the numbers show that it is growing harder to sell cards to high-quality customers.Last month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors released its annual report of credit card banks’ profitability. It showed return on assets falling in 2017, for the fourth year in a row. At 3.4 per cent, it is a full third lower than it was in 2013. The Fed noted that a moderate increase in provisions for losses cut into profits. More important, non-interest revenues — which are made up both of payments from merchants and the annual fees and penalty fees charged to card holders — are declining.Part of this is down to big merchants driving harder bargains with the banks and pushing down on fees. Costco, the big discount retailer, moved its branded cards from American Express to Citi last year, for example.“The banks are giving more to the merchants,” said Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays.Another contributor to the squeeze in fee revenue is generous rewards offers for new customers, which are booked against revenue when the customer signs on.Finally, the compression of non-interest revenue is a long-term effect of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) act of 2009, a law that prohibited many punitive fees and limited the ability to raise customers’ rates.“Issuers lost their ability to dynamically re-price and their ability to generate fee income,” said Brian Riley of Mercator Advisory Group.Fee and margin compression is even visible in the accounts of big banks with stout card portfolios: At JPMorgan Chase’s card business, for example, non-interest revenue fell by $1.8bn, to $4bn, between 2013 and 2017, even as the card loan portfolio grew. At the same time, Chase’s “net revenue rate” — all fee and interest income as a proportion of card loans — has been tightening. A similar pattern of flat or declining fees and compressing margins is visible at Citi and Bank of America.As margins compress and credit metrics soften, it becomes harder for banks to keep the pledges — made frequently in the wake of the financial crisis — to run disciplined businesses, even if that means accepting slower growth. If the industry starts chasing profit at the lower end of the credit spectrum, another crunch would become a matter of time.There are some signs that the banks are pulling back: growth in the number of open card accounts has slowed to the low single digits in the last few quarters, according to the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s loan officer survey also shows more large banks tightening standards for card applications than loosening them.If the long cycle should finally start to turn, though, the pressure on bankers to generate profits will grow greater still. Whether they will maintain their discipline even then will determine the outlook for the industry for years to come."

If the drop holds, that would be its worst day in four months.Synchrony is a provider of Walmart’s store credit cards. According to Bloomberg, more than 10 per cent of the interest and fees Synchrony earned on its loans last year came from the retail giant.The arrangement is up for renegotiation between now and next year, and the report said Walmart is mulling a proposal from Capital One alongside one from Synchrony.
14;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2018-05-17T04:14:28Z;JPMorgan and eBay under fire over shareholder meetings;Companies are among those trying to halt a burgeoning campaign to increase oversight;US companies from JPMorgan Chase to eBay have come under fire from shareholder groups for trying to neuter a burgeoning campaign to strengthen investor oversight of management.A corporate governance movement to make it easier for shareholders to call special meetings, by lowering the required level of investor support, has gathered momentum in the past year.But companies have begun fighting back with what campaigners say amounts to a spoiler tactic designed to thwart their efforts. JPMorgan won support for the status quo in a contentious vote earlier this week, and the issue is set for another showdown at eBay later this month.The ability of shareholders to call special meetings is a powerful weapon for investors who want to oust directors or force other changes at listed companies outside of the regular schedule of annual meetings.While the right is exercised only rarely, campaigners say the mere threat can be enough to pressure companies to respond to investor demands. Examples include Allergan, where activist Bill Ackman demanded such a meeting during a hostile takeover battle.Shareholders have filed formal proposals to make it easier to call special meetings at a record 61 US-listed companies this year, according to the corporate governance consultancy ISS Corporate Solutions. Last year, 24 proposals were filed and attracted an unusually high average shareholder backing of 42 per cent.“It’s being watched closely,” said Peter Kimball, head of advisory at ISS Corporate Solutions.At JPMorgan, Kenneth Steiner — one of the most prolific sponsors of shareholder proposals — called on the bank to accede to future demands for a special meeting if 10 per cent of shareholders wanted one.But the bank responded that “a small minority of shareholders should not be entitled to utilise the mechanism of special meetings for their own interests” and also that there were “significant costs” associated with such events.At its annual meeting in Texas this week, JPMorgan sought “ratification” of existing its rules, which require 20 per cent backing among shareholders before a special meeting can be held. By putting forward its own motion, the bank was able to omit Mr Steiner’s proposal from the ballot.Similarly, the S&P 500 lender Capital One put forward a proposal at its annual meeting earlier this month to ratify its existing rules, omitting a shareholder motion to lower the threshold.The company said that its own proposal provided “a more effective method to commence further engagement on the topic of special meetings, rather than a vote on the stockholder proposal”.By pushing more radical shareholder proposals off the ballot, companies are engaging in “gamesmanship”, said Rosemary Lally of the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members have combined assets of more than $3.5tr. “It’s not a very democratic process when you do it that way.”JPMorgan’s management proposal received 58 per cent shareholder backing and Capital One’s just over half — less support than is typical for management proposals but enough to pass. ISS had recommended shareholders vote against the proposals at both companies.“We asked our shareholders about a threshold that is at or lower than 400 of the S&P 500 companies,” a JPMorgan spokesman said. “Our shareholders have spoken with their vote.”eBay is seeking ratification for its existing 25 per cent threshold at its annual meeting in California on May 30. “The company believes that this management proposal is an effective means to obtain stockholder viewpoints and engage with stockholders,” it said.While shareholders have the right to quiz management at annual meetings, campaigners point to high profile corporate problems such as Wells Fargo’s fake bank accounts scandal to argue that serious issues can emerge between the gatherings.“They’re just trying to thrown down a roadblock,” said John Chevedden, another shareholder campaigner who has put forward proposals to lower the threshold for special meetings. “Who’s the company to say you can’t vote for it this year?”
15;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2018-04-10T04:00:29Z;Fintech pioneer takes new tilt at credit card industry;Ousted Lending Club founder Renaud Laplanche returns to offer consumer lines of credit;Renaud Laplanche, the fintech pioneer who took a bite out of big banks’ credit card balances through his online lending venture Lending Club, is opening up a new line of attack on the industry.Upgrade, the new consumer lending business he launched about a year ago, is to begin offering lines of credit that combine features from fixed-rate personal loans with the flexibility of credit card borrowing.The credit lines will initially be arranged over the internet, but by the end of the year Mr Laplanche expects to supply borrowers with physical cards, allowing them to draw on the line by swiping a piece of plastic — and mounting a frontal challenge to a credit card industry that has already become intensely competitive. Mr Laplanche was a dominant figure in the development of online lending, which bypasses brick-and-mortar banks by connecting needy borrowers with yield-hungry investors.Two years ago he stood down from Lending Club, the firm he founded in 2007, after a governance scandal, having overseen the origination of about $20bn of fixed-rate, fixed-term personal loans. Much of that was used by US consumers to pay down debt held on credit cards, prompting the French-American executive to claim he was “transforming” the banking industry. Mr Laplanche was forced out after it emerged that a small portion of loans had been sold to one buyer with doctored paperwork, and that Mr Laplanche himself had undisclosed conflicts of interest. After taking time off to go hiking with his family in the Alps, he resurfaced with Upgrade, flanked by many of the investors and colleagues who had backed him at Lending Club. One Upgrade shareholder is Union Square Ventures, whose partner John Buttrick said that the company was already fulfilling its promise of being “Lending Club 2.0”: offering better technology, more interactive tools for borrowers, and selling loans only to institutional buyers, rather than retail investors. Lending Club continues to target both, and continues to struggle to make money.According to Mr Laplanche, Upgrade is now producing about $100m of personal loans a month — a volume that it took Lending Club more than six years to achieve.Upgrade’s lines of credit will offer customers borrowing of up to $50,000 at a fixed rate and for a fixed term of between one and five years. Customers can draw down the loan to the extent and on the timeline they wish, with the repayment schedule resetting accordingly.Mr Laplanche is counting on fixed-rate borrowing being more appealing to consumers than the variable cost of credit card debt, at a time when rising base rates are putting a squeeze on habitual borrowers. Total credit card debt held by US consumers stood at $1.03tn at the end of February, according to Federal Reserve data, up about 5 per cent from a year earlier. “Our goal was to develop a product that is lower cost, more predictable and more responsible — a monthly payment of principal — than a credit card,” said Mr Laplanche. “If we’re successful, that $1tn number will go down, not up.” The launch from Upgrade comes as rivals are keeping pressure on the big six card issuers — Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank, Capital One and Discover — which account for about three-quarters of credit card debt outstanding. Lending Club, still the sector leader, is originating about $2.4bn of loans each quarter, while originations at Prosper were up almost a third last year to $2.9bn. Goldman Sachs, too, has high hopes for Marcus, the online lender it launched in 2016 and which had raced to a cumulative $2.3bn in loans by the end of last year. Lending Club sold shares in an initial public offering in December 2014.Mr Laplanche said he was in no rush to do the same for Upgrade. “It’ll be many, many years away, if we ever do [an IPO]. It didn’t work out great, last time around.”
16;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2018-01-23T22:09:20Z;Capital One swings to 4Q loss on tax impact;Revenues roughly in line with market forecasts;Recent changes to the US tax have weighed heavily on the bottom line of Capital One, pushing the credit card company to a loss in the December quarter.Capital One reported a pre-tax impact of $1.77bn owing to those changes, taking the company to a net loss of $971m in the three months ended December 31, compared to a $791m profit a year earlier. That was on a 7 per cent year-on-year increase in revenue to $5.81bn, which was 0.4 per cent below the mean of analyst forecasts in a Thomson Reuters survey.For the calendar year, the company reported a 47 per cent decline in net profit to $1.98bn on an 8 per cent rise in revenue to $22.46bn. The latter was only slightly less than market forecasts.On credit quality, Capital One said its provision for credit losses had increased 17 per cent in calendar 2017 to $7.6bn.
17;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2017-12-30T11:00:27Z;Uber’s rise triggers financial crisis at taxi lenders;Credit unions at risk of failure as loan losses mount;The rise of car-booking apps such as Uber and Lyft is causing a deepening financial crisis at lenders that have financed the US’s traditional taxi drivers, who are now defaulting on their debts.Regulators have warned that some co-operative lenders are so exposed to soured taxi loans that an insurance fund will need to step in to ensure depositors can get their cash.While some listed lenders such as Capital One have posted rising losses from the yellow-cab business, smaller credit unions that specialise in the trade have run into serious financial difficulties.Melrose Credit Union, a lender with $1.5bn in assets established in 1922, is at risk of a potential liquidation as its delinquent loans have leapt fivefold over the past two years, to $670m.“This would be among the largest failures of a credit union ever,” said Keith Leggett, a former senior economist at the American Bankers Association. “It would be very costly. We haven’t seen anything like this since the financial crisis.”Also at risk is Lomto, another New York credit union, whose troubled loans have jumped 10 times over the same period to $39m. Other credit unions from San Francisco to New Jersey are grappling with financial problems, albeit less serious ones, caused by the downturn.Credit unions carved out a lucrative niche financing cab operators, who need to borrow to buy licences, known as medallions, issued by the authorities to collect passengers.But fierce competition from electronic car-booking services has left drivers struggling to repay the loans.Meanwhile, the value of the collateral, the medallions, has collapsed. New York City medallions were worth about $1m four years ago but some are now for sale for as little as $250,000.Melrose and Lomto have already been placed into “conservatorship”, putting regulators in charge. In recent months, their net worth, a crucial measure of financial health, has turned negative.Rick Metsger, a board member of the National Credit Union Administration, has indicated that the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund may need to step in. Deposit accounts up to $250,000 have guaranteed protection.The taxi woes threaten to wipe out a windfall of as much as $800m that credit unions across the US had expected early next year by extracting cash from the over-capitalised insurance fund, Mr Leggett said.Other lenders which are dealing with rising taxi losses include Quorum Federal Credit Union, whose delinquent loans have risen from $14m to $54m in the past two years, and Van Cortlandt Cooperative Federal Credit Union, where they have jumped from $1m to $8m.Bruno Sementilli, Quorum’s chief executive, said its taxi medallion portfolio accounted for about 8 per cent of its total assets. “We are prepared and have adequately reserved for potential losses,” he said. “We are proud to have weathered this disruption to the financial sector.”The National Credit Union Administration said: “In the case of Melrose and Lomto, we are using our conservatorship powers to resolve the situation.“During the financial crisis nearly a decade ago, we used the same conservatorship powers to conserve and resolve the problems in four critically undercapitalised credit unions.”
18;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2017-12-05T10:59:43Z;Credit score row as FICO chief hits out at banks over ‘Fako’ rivals;Transparency of metrics questioned as consumer credit industry faces wider probe;A row has erupted over credit scoring after the head of FICO, the company whose metric underpins trillions of dollars in lending decisions in the US, hit out at some lenders for supplying customers with a rival measure he dismissed as “Fako”.JPMorgan Chase and Capital One risked confusing consumers who wanted to know how lenders viewed their creditworthiness, said FICO’s chief executive Will Lansing.“There’s a three-digit number that’s being shared by the bank with the consumer that is not the score the bank is using to make the lending decision,” he said. “We think there’s room for confusion.”The group that supplies lenders with the rival assessment, VantageScore, hit back, saying Mr Lansing was spreading “misinformation aimed at discrediting FICO’s only real competitor”.“Thousands of lenders use VantageScore credit scores in their businesses, including for credit decisions,” it added.The spat points to the opacity of credit scoring, a crucial part of America’s consumer finance economy that is in the spotlight after the huge data loss at the credit reporting company Equifax. Capitol Hill has been scrutinising how the scores are determined and used as part of a wider probe into consumer credit.FICO provides software which credit reporting companies such as Equifax, TransUnion and Experian use to generate the credit scores they provide to banks and credit card companies.FICO’s score remains the most widely used, although the credit reporting companies developed their own competing model, VantageScore. Lenders often use several different measures in their decisions.Adding to the complexity, each credit reporting company generates its own version of the FICO score, using the information it has collated about consumers.The scores aim to predict how likely individuals are to repay their debts by considering factors such as payment record, amounts owed and length of credit history.US lenders use them to determine the terms consumers get on credit cards, mortgages and other loans. The FICO algorithm assigns borrowers a three-digit rating between 300 and 850. In some cases, according to FICO, its score for a customer can differ from other formulas by more than 100 points.Chase offers holders of its Slate cards a monthly FICO score but provides TransUnion’s VantageScore for “educational purposes” to other consumers — they do not need to be customers of the bank — through its Credit Journey service.“We offer anyone who enrols in Credit Journey free credit scores,” the bank said.Similarly, Capital One also provides the VantageScore readout to consumers through its CreditWise service. “The score is only one aspect of credit,” it said. “CreditWise users get access to much richer information.”Mr Lansing said “virtually all the major banks” provide customers with FICO scores free of charge. “There’s a couple of exceptions,” he said, raising questions about transparency. “It looks like it, smells like it, feels like it — it’s being presented as some kind of an indication of your health, but if you look at the fine print, you’ll discover that it’s not a FICO score,” he said.Consumer rights advocates warn customers can find themselves unexpectedly turned down for mortgages or other loans because they thought their score was better than it really was.“We have always advocated that all consumers should have access to a free reliable score — reliable meaning the score the lender uses to make a decision,” said Pamela Banks, senior policy counsel at Consumers Union.Liz Weston, author of Your Credit Score, said: “If all you want to do is generally monitor you credit and be alerted if there’s a problem then essentially any score will do.”But she added: “If you’re getting a specific loan, a few points will make a difference.”TransUnion said VantageScore was used by more than 2,400 lenders and “yields the most consistent results”.

Profit before tax was Rbs6.6bn, a 67 per cent increase year-on-year, while the net margin went up 41 per cent to Rbs12.2bn year-on-year.Tinkoff will pay out $40.2m in scheduled dividends and an extra dividend of $32.9m, it said on Monday. The company issued 735,000 credit cards in the last quarter, more than twice as many as a year ago.Oliver Hughes, chief executive of Tinkoff Bank, said:Our diversification process has continued to show impressive results, with non-credit businesses contributing increasingly to both the top and bottom lines. As of today over 22% of our top line result comes from non-credit business lines.Last month, TCS’s share price saw the company surpass its initial $3.2bn valuation for the first time since it went public four years ago – shortly before the Russian financial crisis saw its value plummet by more than two thirds.
20;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2017-06-28T21:27:10Z;Stress tests clear big US banks for $100bn payout;Fed gives green light to buybacks and dividends totalling almost 100% of earnings;"Regulators have given US banks the go-ahead to pay out almost all their earnings to shareholders this year in a signal of their confidence in the health of the financial system.The Federal Reserve has given the green light to a record level of post-crisis distributions, including an estimated total of almost $100bn from the six largest banks. All 34 institutions passed the second part of its annual stress test, although the Fed did call out weaknesses in capital planning at Capital One, one of the country’s biggest consumer lenders, which it wants addressed.The big six US banks — Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo — are set to return to shareholders between $95bn and $97bn over the next four quarters, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy. That is about 50 per cent more than they were able to hand out after last year’s exam.Fed officials argued banks had built up substantial capital cushions to withstand a meltdown of the kind that rocked global financial markets in 2008.It was the first time since the Fed began conducting the tests seven years ago, in the wake of the financial crisis, that officials waved through the capital distribution plans for all the banks tested.The clean sweep became significantly easier for the industry to achieve this year, however. The Fed dropped the “qualitative” part of the test — in recent years the toughest part of the exercise — for smaller US lenders and several foreign groups, totalling 21 of the 34 banks.Individual banks on Wednesday evening began to disclose their proposed payouts for the year ahead (see below). Senior Fed officials said the 34 banks were in aggregate projected to pay out close to 100 per cent of net earnings over the next four quarters. That is up sharply from 65 per cent in last year’s stress tests. The findings sent shares in the big six banks up about 1 or 2 per cent in after-hours trading in New York.Ahead of the results, KBW analysts forecast that the big six should be able to distribute a net $78.9bn in total, a rise of about a third from a year ago.—————-Analysis: Fed gives nod to ‘payout party time’ for banks
Lex: US banks, feeling special
Insight: Passing tests does not mean banks should splash cash—————-Capital One was put on notice it needed to address certain weakness or face a block on shareholder payouts, pushing its shares down 2.4 per cent after hours.The Fed provided few details about why it had fallen short. It said the company’s capital plan “did not appropriately take into account the potential impact of the risks in one of its most material businesses,” without saying what the business was.Another consumer lender, American Express, was forced to rewrite its capital distribution plan in the wake of its first-round stress test result last week, although regulators gave their blessing to the new, more conservative payout proposal.The warning to Capital One and rethink by American Express comes after the stress test drew attention to the banking industry’s exposure to credit card lending. The Fed found banks would suffer the biggest losses in their card portfolios in its hypothetical crisis they devised to stress test the industry’s balance sheets. Fed officials said that partly reflected a rapid expansion in the size of banks’ credit card assets and rising delinquency rates in the real world.Senior Fed officials said that although Capital One’s problems did not generate a full objection, regulators were sufficiently concerned with its capital planning that they wanted it to immediately begin fixing its practices and submit a new plan by the end of December.Confounding predictions from some on Wall Street, Wells Fargo was given the thumbs up from regulators to go ahead with its planned distribution.The green light will be a relief to the scandal-hit bank and its newly appointed chief executive Tim Sloan. Ahead of the results, some investors and analysts said the fake accounts scandal, which erupted last year, could prompt the Fed to fail Wells on “qualitative” grounds.The banks which have announced their plans include the following: JPMorgan intends to boost its quarterly common stock dividend to 56 cents a share, from 50 cents a share at present. It also announced a share buyback programme of up to $19.4bn between June 1 2017 and June 30 2018. Citigroup plans to boost its quarterly dividend to 32 cents a share and launch a share repurchase program of up to $15.6bn. Combined, the capital actions total $18.9bn over the next year. Wells Fargo said it plans to lift its quarterly dividend by a penny to 39 cents a share and will launch a $11.5bn share buyback program. Morgan Stanley announced a $5bn share buyback and said it would boost its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share, from 20 cents at present.Bank of America’s board authorised a $12bn share repurchase plan and plans to lift its dividend by 60 per cent to 12 cents a share.Goldman Sachs merely stated that the Fed had not objected to its capital plan with CEO Lloyd Blankfein stating: “We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise”.Capital One, which conditionally passed the stress test and must resubmit its plans, said it would maintain its current dividend of 40 cents a share, and expects to buy back up to $1.85bn of its stock.Mamta Badkar in New York"

Senior Fed officials said the 34 banks that took part in the tests were in aggregate close to paying out almost all of their projected net earnings over the next four quarters. That is up sharply from 65 per cent in last year’s stress tests.The officials added that the figures were further proof that banks had built up substantial capital cushions to withstand a crisis of the kind that rocked global financial markets in 2008.

The company warned last June that write-off rates were running higher than forecast.Several US banks have also disclosed deteriorating credit card metrics. JPMorgan Chase declared in the first quarter that $990m worth of loans were unlikely to be collected, a fifth more than a year ago.Executives said rising losses were to be expected given the businesses had been expanding and default rates had been historically low.Marianne Lake, chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase, told analysts that losses were still running at “very, very low levels”. Margaret Keane, Synchrony’s chief executive, insisted the company was still operating in a “fairly good macro environment”, citing lower unemployment.However, analysts said the earnings season made clear that a boom in consumer credit quality had come to an end, and some were concerned that issuers were continuing to expand despite the rising levels of soured loans.Lenders have been piling into credit cards, attracted by the prospect of heftier returns than other types of banking.Issuers have been wooing customers with generous reward schemes but typically charge interest rates of between 13 and 20 per cent to those who fail to pay off balances. Some have been signing up riskier customers with lower credit ratings, for whom interest rates are even higher.US credit card users had racked up $1tn in debts by the end of last year, according to The Nilson Report.Kenneth Bruce, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: “There’s been a lot of growth across consumer credit for a lot of companies. We haven’t seen anybody really pull back.”Richard Fairbank, chief executive of Capital One, indicated the group was easing off on the lending accelerator as its first-quarter results showed that net charge-offs rose 28 per cent from last year to $1.51bn.“We have been tightening our underwriting,” he told analysts. “We still see growth opportunities in our domestic card business, but our growth window is gradually getting smaller.”Synchrony and Capital One are the two worst performing of the 65 biggest US financial stocks so far this year.They and Discover are considered a good guide to the health of low- and middle-income consumers given the scale of their mass market operations.
24;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2016-12-22T16:04:48Z;Credit card providers fight to stay top of your wallet;US lenders splash out on reward schemes but need customers to stick around and spend;"Of course Brian Kelly named his dog Miles. Mr Kelly has been obsessing about air miles and credit card rewards since he was a child. In the 1990s he helped his father book business trips on the internet, amassing enough miles to send the family on winter holidays that made neighbours think they were hugely wealthy.Scroll forward 20 years and Mr Kelly is the go-to guy for millions of people who want to maximise their credit card rewards. From an office in Manhattan’s financial district, where Miles, a blue French bulldog, plays beneath the desks of a staff of 10 writers, Mr Kelly runs The Points Guy, the most popular of a host of websites that help cardholders compare air miles and other perks on offer for signing up to new cards and for putting purchases on them.Partly thanks to sites like Mr Kelly’s, the battle to be “top of wallet” among America’s highest-earning, highest-spending cardholders intensified sharply in 2016 — and it looks likely to escalate further, so much so that the rewards war has started to concern investors and analysts.American Express, whose Platinum card was once an undisputed must-have for premium travellers, is having to launch a costly fightback against Chase, which launched its Sapphire Reserve card this year with eye-popping sign-up bonuses and extensive rewards on spending. Chase attracted so much interest that its supplier ran out of the metal to make the Reserve card and the bank had to issue plastic ones instead. Now it must convince investors that these excited new customers will stick around long enough — and spend and borrow enough — to justify the costs of luring them over.It is possible to declare one winner of the rewards war already: consumers. “It is an amazing time to be a consumer,” says Mr Kelly. “Sign-up bonuses of 100,000 points on the Sapphire Reserve, up to 250,000 points on small-business cards from Amex, and more and more. Miles and points are cash, that’s what we teach people, and it’s certainly nice when the credit card companies are giving you $1,000, $1,500, $2,000 for getting a single credit card.”Issuers are also trying to persuade customers to put more on their particular card by offering extra rewards across a range of purchases. After Chase offered triple points on restaurant spending on the Sapphire Reserve, Amex responded by saying flights purchased with its Platinum card would earn five times the points. These accumulated rewards points can be converted into more flights, upgrades and other travel perks, such as access to plush airport lounges and free hotel stays — all paid for by the card providers. There are other offers and rebates; both Amex and Chase return some portion of the annual card fee to customers to spend on travel, and Chase has wooed millennial customers by expanding that rebate to cover Uber rides.Between 2010 and the end of 2015, the six largest US card issuers paid more than $100bn in credit card rewards, according to the research firm Instinet, and this year has witnessed the fastest growth so far. The six issuers — which also include Capital One, Citigroup, Bank of America and Discover — are on course to pay $22.6bn in rewards this year, 18 per cent higher than in 2015 and more than twice the sum they paid out as recently as 2010. Amex, with an estimated $6.8bn in rewards costs, remains the most generous, but at $6.6bn, Chase has almost closed the gap.Bill Carcache and Steven Chubak, the analysts behind the Instinet report, say that while the bank issuers have all at least doubled their rewards expenses in the past six years, Amex’s payouts have grown only 36 per cent. When it comes to premium customers, the company may be paying out less than half the rewards of its rivals. It will have to be more generous, they said, “particularly in a market where heightened transparency exists round the value of rewards and consumers have no tolerance for being short-changed”.Gary Leff, who writes View From The Wing, a travel blog, says consumers are becoming savvier at comparing rewards offers. “Not all points are equally valuable, since you have all these proprietary currencies that do not equate one to one,” he says. “Consumers have come to understand them better — not perfectly, but enough that programmes have to adapt and stay competitive.”Mr Leff and Mr Kelly agree that the comparison websites should not take all the credit for the rewards war. Perhaps the biggest factor is the regulatory changes wrought in the US by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform. While more esoteric forms of lending and market activity have been penalised, big banks have found that standard credit card lending to consumers is more lucrative, hence the dash to grab market share.The bank issuers and Amex have taken different approaches to making money from credit cards. Amex has traditionally earned the bulk of its revenue from the fees that merchants pay on each transaction, while banks collect more from interest on customers’ balances. In the jargon, Amex has a “spend-centric” model, while banks are “lend-centric”. That means Amex and banks are trying to encourage different patterns of use by their cardholders.The existence of the comparison sites raises the possibility that customers will prove less loyal and predictable than in the past. While Chase and Amex splurge on advertising their offers on these sites, analysts are worried about the efficacy of the strategy.“We are reluctant to count too heavily on loyalty in today’s rewards environment,” Messrs Carcache and Chubak wrote. “We believe sites like these tend to attract high-risk customers who are prone to accepting an offer with the end goal of earning reward points after achieving a minimum spending target within a present timeframe, only to turn around and stuff the card in a shoe box after receiving the welcome offer.”This is a concern at Amex, too. Ken Chenault, the company’s chief executive for the past 15 years, said it would not be chasing new customers and new customer spending at any cost. “We are not interested in chasing short-term market share,” he said at a Goldman Sachs conference this month. “The focus is not just on promotions. That’s really not why they get a Platinum card. They get a Platinum card based on the services that we provide. The Centurion lounges [at airports], the concierge services, the Transportation Security Administration Global Entry fee, all of those features are very important.”Concerns notwithstanding, Amex has been unable to avoid the fray. It has told investors to expect “significantly higher” marketing and promotional spending in the fourth quarter, so that the full-year total will be about 10 per cent more than last year’s $3.1bn. This spending includes the costs of sign-up bonuses, such as the 40,000 membership rewards points it offers new Platinum customers.At the same time, it has told investors that it will also be more generous with rewards on spending in 2017 — although rarely has a multimillion-dollar giveaway been promised in such dry language. “You will see a reversal of the trend we have seen the last few quarters where neutral rewards have been growing a little bit more slowly than billings,” Jeff Campbell, Amex chief financial officer, said on the company’s most recent earnings call in October.The promise of extra spending on rewards and promotions comes after a period of cost-cutting by Amex, its earlier response to the decline in market share and profitability. The company’s shares, which fell 25 per cent in 2015, have risen 8 per cent this year but they lag the S&P 500’s 11 per cent gain.ValueAct, the activist hedge fund that targets companies in need of a big strategic overhaul, sniffed around the company last year, taking a $1bn stake but then selling out without making a public case for change. Concern over the company even surfaced at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting this year. Berkshire, run by the legendary investor Warren Buffett, is Amex’s largest shareholder, with a 16 per cent stake, and Amex is one of Berkshire’s “big four” publicly traded investments.“I still feel good about owning American Express,” Mr Buffett said at the Berkshire meeting in April. “Their position . . . will continue to be under attack. It’s too big a business . . . for people to ignore it.”Mr Chenault has taken a similar line with critics, pointing out that despite the fierce competition from Chase Sapphire Reserve in the premium market, the company has increased its customer base and income from card fees, such as the $450-a-year Platinum fee.“Most of the competitors are copying us,” he told the Goldman Sachs audience. “Clearly, the environment we’re in is very intense competitively. But the reality is that we’ve been dealing with competition for decades. If someone takes the position that all customers are the same, and they will react only to promotional offers or something that’s free, and they discount the elements of value, we wouldn’t have been in business over the last 50 years.”Mr Leff says that while Chase has won market share for its Sapphire Reserve card with offers such as triple points on restaurant spending, Amex may be more subtle.“Amex uses a lot more targeted offers than Chase does, and they think they have got better at figuring which customers they are trying to acquire. There are lots of things that they try to do to make their portfolios better when they acquire those customers, giving them bonuses for different kind of spending.”For the savviest consumers, this means more potential travel perks and freebies, and as trailblazers like Mr Kelly have shown, it can bring a big lifestyle upgrade. A recent holiday was paid for with the piles of rewards currencies he has accumulated across his 30 personal and business credit cards. It is some boast: first class to the Maldives, via JFK, Frankfurt and Singapore, for 221,000 KrisFlyer points and 170.80 Singapore dollars instead of a $10,616 cash outlay; a five-night stay at the St Regis Maldives for 130,000 Starpoints instead of $11,655 out of pocket.“It is just a shame Miles the dog has to stay home,” he adds.Consumers may be winning the rewards wars, but that does not mean that Amex, Chase, Citi and the rest will ultimately be losers. In fact, there can be many winners, Mr Kelly says.“Airlines have gotten billions of dollars from the credit card companies. The card companies are getting even more billions from merchants to process credit cards. So, that’s what I like about it. When consumers are educated, too, everyone can make out.”Comparison websites have helped consumers become more knowledgable about the credit card market. Gary Leff, who runs the View from the Wing blog, offers tips for winning the rewards war.Set a rewards goalAsk, “what am I planning to get out of this?” If your goal is business class to South Africa, it is no good accumulating points on Southwest Airlines. If you are looking to travel frequently to and within Europe, United Airlines has the most partners and Chase points transfer to United, so a Chase card is a good fit. If your goal is first class to Australia on American Airlines, you can earn more miles with a Starwood American Express card than with an American Airlines credit card.Take stock of your spendingIf you are a business traveller who pays your own expenses and then gets reimbursed, you will not do better than the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which gives triple points on travel and dining. That will not be true if your main spending is on groceries. You want to be earning double or triple points on the categories you spend most on.Always sign up to promotionsThere are often promotions offering particular hotels or air travel routes at a discount on points, but issuers usually require you to sign up in advance. Click on every email. You may say, “I’m not going to stay at that hotel chain”, but you never know if you are going to get stuck in a city somewhere.The golden ruleRewards cards generally have higher annual percentage rates. The game does not work at all if you are not paying off your cards or if you spend more than you would otherwise have spent. It requires a discipline that does not come naturally to everyone."
25;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2016-10-03T13:04:10Z;Bass Pro reels in Cabela’s in $5.5bn deal;;Hook, line and sinker.Bass Pro has agreed to acquire Cabela’s for $65.50 per share in cash, in a move to combine two of America’s largest hunting and fishing retailers in a deal valued at about $5.5bn.The offer represented a more than 19 per cent premium to Cabela’s closing price on Friday. The deal comes about a year after Elliott Associates disclosed a stake in the specialty outdoors retailer and began pressuring it to explore strategic options including a sale.Separately, Cabela’s also said it was selling its credit card operation – including its $5.2bn credit card receivables portfolio – to Capital One.The move arrives amid turmoil in the specialty sports retailers space as consumers increasingly shop online and buy directly from brands like Nike and Under Armour. Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, while City Sports, a Boston-based sports retailer, filed for bankruptcy late last year.Cabela shares, which had climbed 18 per cent so far this year, jumped more than 14 per cent in pre-market trading to $62.85.
26;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2016-07-31T17:08:42Z;US $18bn credit card debt spree sparks fears;Concerns that too much risk is being taken on in slowing economy;US banks have ramped up lending to consumers through credit cards and overdrafts at the fastest pace since 2007, triggering concerns that they are taking on too much risk in a slowing economy.The industry has piled on about $18bn of card loans and other types of revolving credit within just three months, as consumers borrow more and banks battle for customers with air miles, cashback deals and other offers.The surge in lending has come as economists expect the US election to create sufficient uncertainty to impede growth for the rest of the year, increasing the stakes for lenders at a time when the credit cycle appears to have passed a peak.Recently disclosed second-quarter results showed that credit card loans increased 10 per cent year-on-year at Wells Fargo, 12 per cent at Citigroup and 16 per cent at US Bank, according to Deutsche Bank research. Expansion was an especially aggressive 26 per cent at SunTrust, the $200bn Atlanta-based lender.Across the US banking industry, credit card and other revolving loans rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.6 per cent in the second quarter to $685bn, according to Federal Reserve data.The credit card business remains among the most profitable in banking. Lenders can charge much higher interest rates — the US average is between 12 and 14 per cent — than for other types of credit, and borrower delinquencies are still low by historical standards.However, there are some early indications that the cycle is beginning to turn.“In the present environment it’s probably a safe strategy, but as we saw with housing in 07/08 that environment can change very rapidly,” said Nancy Bush, banking analyst at Georgia-based NAB Research. “They need to be very careful.”Bob Hammer, the veteran credit-card consultant, said: “Times are pretty good right now, but it’s questionable how long it’s going to last”.Synchrony Financial, the largest supplier of store-branded cards in the US, sent a shudder through the sector in June when it increased its forecast for credit losses.Several banks have since disclosed that they have boosted reserves for losses, although executives said this largely reflected expansion of their businesses rather than a deterioration in credit quality.Capital One added $375m to its loan loss reserve for its domestic card business, according to Barclays, while JPMorgan Chase added a $250m loss allowance for its credit-card portfolio.The largest US bank by assets has expanded in the past two or three years into what Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer, described as the “near prime space” — in essence, customers with lower credit scores.Executives say that the lending push is justified as the consumers they target are in good financial shape, pointing to rising house prices and low unemployment.“We’re growing our direct consumer lending portfolio at a very rapid pace,” said William Rogers, chairman and chief executive of SunTrust. “That is indeed helping to mitigate the effect of [pressure on profit margins] overall.”
27;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2016-01-06T19:42:33Z;Pioneer Natural joins energy slide as it ups capex;;Energy stocks are once again being punished amid a sharp drop in crude prices but the sell-off in Pioneer Natural Resources on Wednesday is being driven by more than just the downbeat sentiment.Shares in the Dallas-based company, which primarily owns assets in the Permian Basin, the largest shale field in the US, fell 7.6 per cent to $115.69 after expanding the size of a planned capital raising late on Tuesday.Pioneer said it would sell 12m shares at $117 a share, raising about $1.4bn, with an option to sell an additional 1.8m shares. It had previously set out to sell 10.5m.The larger offering “is a surprise given Pioneer’s relative balance sheet strength and its lack of needs on the acquisition front (in contrast to recent playbooks of smaller Permian peers using equity to fund M&A while keeping leverage at palatable levels),” said Phillips Johnston, an analyst at Capital One Securities.The funds are expected to be used, in part, to develop its drilling in the Permian basin.At a time when energy companies are scrambling to reduce costs, Pioneer, which came under fire from hedge fund manager David Einhorn last year, said it was lifting its 2016 capital spending budget. The company plans to spend between $2.4bn to $2.6bn this year, compared with $2.2bn the previous year.The S&P 500 energy sector is down more than 3 per cent and is the worst performer on the benchmark index as Brent crude has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade.
28;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-12-29T16:00:15Z;Activists take aim at muddling midsized banks;US lenders generating subpar returns face pressure to merge;Midsized banks be warned: muddling along with subpar returns will no longer cut it.Dozens of regional lenders in the US, from People’s United of Bridgeport, Connecticut to Umpqua Holdings of Portland, Oregon, are at present making less than a 10 per cent return on equity. All should listen out for a knock on the door from PL Capital Advisors, a New Jersey-based activist determined to shake up a flabby and fragmented part of the banking sector.PL, which made its name forcing change at small, community-focused banks, is about to launch a new fund to go after bigger targets, seeking to exploit disenchantment with feeble profits among institutional investors and a friendlier regulatory attitude toward mergers.Other activists are preparing for battle, from Basswood Capital Management and Stillwell Value, both New York hedge funds, to Seidman & Associates of New Jersey.Now that banks have steadied themselves after the crisis, there is a sense of “back to basics,” says Rich Lashley, one of PL’s two principals. “More and more [merger] discussions are going on behind the scenes. Everyone is trying to figure out if they are a buyer or a seller.”Years of low growth, ultra-easy monetary policy and post-crisis regulations have squeezed profits for hundreds of American banks, forcing them to rely on cutting costs to improve margins. But many of the 1,156 publicly listed lenders are still posting returns well below their cost of capital, despite running down expenses as far as they will go. The obvious solution? Merge — or at least find very good reasons not to.“Banks need to stop kidding themselves that [higher interest] rates are going to save them,” says Nathan Stovall, an analyst at SNL Financial. “Hope is not a strategy.”Observers note that the backdrop for the activists has improved. Seven years on from the depths of the Lehman crisis, regulators still seem opposed to deals involving JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup or Bank of America, which remain under pressure to shrink and become less complex. But the banks beneath them appear to have a green light to get bigger.One Wall Street dealmaker notes that BB&T of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has done three chunky acquisitions in a little over a year. He concludes that the US Federal Reserve wants to see more “super-regional” lenders challenging US Bancorp, PNC Financial Services and Capital One beneath the top tier.“If I’m [Daniel] Tarullo, I want ten of these guys, not three,” he says, referring to the Fed’s lead banking supervisor.In one successful strike for activism, New York Community Bancorp agreed a $2bn deal in October with New York-based Astoria Financial. Astoria had been targeted by Basswood, which disclosed a 9.22 per cent stake in July and said it had requested a board seat. In its filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Basswood argued that Astoria had “substantial opportunities . . . to take steps to enhance shareholder value.”More deals are beginning to flow. Since the end of September, New York’s M&T Bank was cleared to complete a $3.7bn merger with Hudson City, a regional rival, after a three-year wait, while KeyCorp of Cleveland announced a $4bn tie-up with Buffalo-based First Niagara.First Niagara, a $39bn-in-assets bank which had achieved a double-digit ROE in just one of the past 20 years, is a “classic example” of the kind of subpar performer PL is planning to go after, according to Mr Lashley of PL. He says he aims to raise about $200m from rich individuals, and is ready to team up with other activist funds to increase his negotiating power.If you want to get honey you can’t kick over the beehiveOthers on PL’s potential hit-list — between $5bn and $75bn in assets, and a single-digit ROE — include Comerica, a Dallas-based lender getting to grips with the oil slump, and Zions Bancorp, a Salt Lake City-based bank which the Fed judged to be short of capital last year. All told, that group of 79 lenders accounts for $1.18tn of assets, or about one-tenth of the listed US banking sector.Activism in bank stocks poses particular challenges. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, no investor can accrue a stake of more than 10 per cent in a bank without first becoming a bank itself. That has encouraged fund managers to take small stakes in their targets, often appealing to managers behind closed doors rather than shaking fists in public.“If you want to get honey you can’t kick over the beehive,” says Christopher Marinac, co-founder of FIG Partners, an Atlanta-based research and advisory boutique.That is the modus operandi of Larry Seidman of Seidman & Associates, a Parsippany, New Jersey-based firm which has challenged dozens of bank management teams over the years.Now that regulatory requirements have “dramatically increased,” he says, it is easier to make the case that executives need to consider radical action.At these kind of size levels, in this kind of environment, “you’ve got to be really, really good to earn a decent ROE. And if you can’t, you have an obligation as a director to do something about it.”
29;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-12-14T17:39:29Z;Former Wall St titans shake-up banking with fintech investments;Big names are busy disrupting their old industry via technology;They made their name on Wall Street. Now, they are trying to disrupt it.Some of the world’s highest-profile bankers have poured millions of dollars into the booming fintech sector during the past year as they tap into new technology providing online financial services from payments and lending to digital currencies and cross-border transfers.Earlier this month, Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who pioneered the use of complex derivatives, was said to have turned down the job of running Barclays’ investment bank to focus on Digital Asset Holdings, a New York-based start-up trying to cut banks’ back-office costs by using technology associated with bitcoin.Other luminaries who have swapped banking for fintech with the aim of challenging traditional businesses include Vikram Pandit, the former chief executive of Citigroup, and John Mack, the ex-boss of Morgan Stanley.Hans Morris, the former president of Visa, who launched Nyca Partners last year to finance and advise fintech start-ups, said Wall Street’s top bankers have been attracted by the scope to develop new, nimble products without being held back by intense new regulation required at the traditional banks.“The cliché would be ‘regulation is driving me crazy’. It’s not like that,” said Mr Morris. “It is the scale of what has been asked and the constant wave of new regulatory initiatives. That’s what gets you down.”Free of stringent regulation and legacy IT systems, fintech has become one of this year’s hottest sectors, with start-ups attracting billions of dollars of investment. In the third quarter alone, global investment into venture-backed fintech companies such as marketplace lending hit a record $4.85bn, according to CB Insights, a data provider to the venture capital industry.Goldman Sachs has estimated the emerging fintech industry could snatch more than $4.7tn in revenue and $470bn in profit from traditional financial services companies.The flood of money into the sector has also pushed up the valuations of start-ups, with several - including Funding Circle and TransferWise - achieving so-called “unicorn” valuations of $1bn or more.Some of the movers shaking up the old-world of finance are featured below.Since he was ousted from Citi in 2012, Vikram Pandit has become one of the most prolific investors in fintech start-ups. The Indian-born banker steered Citi through the financial crisis, but now his investments are in companies that are trying to wrest business from established banks.Among the 58-year-old’s investments is CommonBond, an online provider of student loans. It raised more than $100m in debt and equity from investors including Mr Pandit in September 2013. The company says a typical CommonBond customer — 32 years old with a FICO credit score about 770 and a six-figure salary — pays about $14,000 less over the lifetime of the loan, compared to a government programme.In 2013, Mr Pandit was among a group of investors who ploughed $2.7m into Orchard, a data and infrastructure provider for the marketplace lending sector that also counts former Goldman Sachs co-president Jon Winkelried as a backer.Mr Pandit’s fintech portfolio also includes MMKT Exchange, which is developing technology to improve liquidity in the secondary market for loans. More recently, this year he made an undisclosed investment during the $58m fundraising round for TransferWise which valued the cross-border payments company at almost $1bn.John Mack wasted little time in trying to shake-up the very business at which he spent more than three decades. Since stepping down as chief executive of Morgan Stanley in 2011, he has invested in a clutch of fintech companies, including Lending Club and Orchard.The 71-year-old banker was one of an array of high-profile investors who helped raise $130m for Dataminr, which analyses social media to create alerts for traders, in March 2015. The fundraising valued the company at about $700m.Along with former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and several prominent venture capitalists, Mr Mack also sits on the board of Lending Club. His 2.4m shares in the marketplace lender were valued at $36m when it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2014, but are now worth just under $33m as the company’s shares have slipped in their first year of trading.In September, Mr Mack participated in a $10m initial funding round for credit-rating start-up NEFT, or New England Funding Technologies. The company allows borrowers to update credit scores in real-time and hopes to launch its first product, the mPowerCredit platform, in 2016.After a long career in the credit card business, Joe Saunders, 69, was appointed as chief executive of Visa in 2007. He steered the global technology and payments company to its initial public offering on Nasdaq in 2008, then the largest IPO in US history, before retiring in 2012.A year later, he helped launch Green Visor Capital, a venture capital firm focused on early stage fintech companies. “Over the past few years, the changes brought about by the adoption of new technologies has been dramatic and will only accelerate in the months ahead,” Mr Saunders said this year.In September 2015, Green Visor led a $1.5m investment round in payments start-up Kash, a San Francisco-based start-up that aims to disrupt established credit card networks. As part of that fundraising, Mr Saunders joined the board as chairman.That same month, Green Visor also participated in the $8m venture financing round for Cloud Lending Solutions, a technology provider to marketplace lenders and other finance companies. Other investments include DataFox, the research and analytics platform, which raised $5m in July.Hans Morris spent 27 years at Citigroup, rising to become the US bank’s chief financial officer and head of finance, technology and operations for Citi Markets and Banking. He left to become president of Visa from 2007 to 2009 before moving to private equity group General Atlantic in 2010.In 2014 he founded tech venture capital firm Nyca Partners with a plan to invest $20m-$25m over 18 months in financial technology companies focusing on alternative consumer credit, merchant payment solutions and financial infrastructure software. “We bring together expertise on the financial system with lots of Silicon Valley connections,” Mr Morris said at the time.In addition, Nyca has invested in Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform that competes with Kickstarter, and Affirm, a company founded by Max Levchin, PayPal co-founder and former chairman of Yelp, that seeks to create a new way for consumers to apply for short-term credit.Mr Morris is also an investor alongside Vikram Pandit in CommonBond. He held a $4.3m stake, or almost 290,000 shares, in Lending Club at the time of its IPO and sits on the lender’s board.A former JPMorgan veteran, Blythe Masters made her name as a pioneer of credit default swaps, the complex instruments which became infamous for helping fuel the mortgage crisis of 2008.Since leaving the US bank in April 2014, Ms Masters has become one of the most outspoken Wall Street advocates for blockchain, the database technology that underpins the controversial digital currency bitcoin. In 2015, she joined blockchain start-up Digital Asset Holdings as chief executive to create products to streamline slow, paper-based parts of the financial services machinery, such as settlement.The company has made several acquisitions since the beginning of the year, including buying San Francisco-based Hyperledger and Budapest-based Bits of Proof for undisclosed amounts. In October, Digital Asset Holdings bought Blockstack.io, which aims to provide private blockchain services to the world’s finance industry.Back to the top of the page
30;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-12-13T23:37:02Z;Ten developments in digital finance;Innovations include blockchain technology, wearables and monetising data;"Digital technology has changed the face of banking. “But innovation for innovation’s sake is a waste; it must have a genuine customer benefit,” says Ashok Vaswani, chief executive of Barclays’ retail bank. Useful or not, here is a round-up of the latest developments.1. Investment in digital banksA number of traditional high street lenders are taking stakes in more nimble digital banks. BBVA in Spain, for example, has acquired a stake in digital-only Atom Bank in the UK and Simple in the US.Warren Mead, head of challenger banking at KPMG, says such investments could be a solution to fixing problems with banks’ creaking IT.2. BlockchainBlockchain, the technology predicated on a shared database that underpins the cryptocurrency bitcoin, is being adapted for banking. It could speed up settlements and bolster security.3. Collaboration with marketplace lendersBanks are teaming up with peer-to-peer platforms, with a recent example being Metro Bank’s partnership with P2P lender Zopa in the UK.4. Digital paymentsThe launch of Apple Pay heralds the move of digital payments into the mainstream. A number of banks in the US and UK have signed up to Apple Pay.5. Video links for servicesBanks are increasingly focused on ways to provide a digital service, including use of video, rather than simply concentrating on product sales, in order to retain customers.6. WearablesWearables are the next mobile payment frontier. Barclays launched a bPay product range in the UK, which consists of a digital wallet linked to one of three devices — a wristband, fob or sticker — that can be used to pay at more than 300,000 locations across the UK.7. Social mediaBanks are adopting social media, from Snapchat to Twitter and Facebook, both for internal use and to interact with customers.Royal Bank of Scotland recently partnered with Facebook to provide employees with an internal communication site.8. Monetising dataNew banks are seeking to help customers monetise data. Mr Mead at KPMG says Secco Bank, set to launch soon in the UK, is focused on this.9. BiometricsRBS in the UK recently enabled Touch ID on its banking app as a way for customers to more easily log on using their fingerprint.

31;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-12-07T07:00:58Z;The fastest and longest goalscoring streaks in world football;;Jamie Vardy’s record-setting Premier League goalscoring streak for Leicester City has been hailed as one of the most remarkable individual achievements of modern English football, but how does it compare to similar feats elsewhere?Many have pointed out that Vardy’s run of scoring in 11 successive top flight English matches remains behind that of Jimmy Dunne, who made it to 12 for Sheffield United in 1931/32.But given how much the game has changed over the intervening 60-plus years in terms of tactics, fitness and other factors, perhaps a better way of contextualising his record is to compare it to those of his contemporaries.Looking at goalscoring streaks in the last two decades, Vardy is in exalted company. If we use the same criteria by which his record is judged — league games only — he ranks equal third behind only Robert Lewandowski and Lionel Messi, whose incredible 21 match scoring run ran from November 2012 to May 2013.And it’s even better for Vardy if we apply the rules more stringently: Lewandowski’s streak included a two match suspension where he was unable to take to the field. Looking only at completely unbroken sequences of matches Vardy moves up to equal second.Broadening out to include domestic and European knockout tournaments and internationals raises the stakes somewhat, and unfortunately for Vardy, he misses out here since his Premier League streak is bisected by a Capital One Cup tie against Hull where he failed to find the net.But two players whose feats remain astonishing however we slice the data are Messi and his Argentine compatriot Gabriel Batistuta. Batistuta’s 11 game scoring streak at the start of the 1994/95 season in Italy’s Serie A was preceded by a goal in his last game at the 1994 World Cup, extending the run to 12 in all competitions.Meanwhile the magnificent Messi features with two separate streaks. Over winter 2012/13 he notched 33 goals across 21 consecutive league appearances (an injury after the 19th match curtails the streak if we look strictly at successive league matches for his club). And earlier in 2012 a completely separate run saw him score an incredible 21 in 9 consecutive matches in all competitions, including 5 in one Champions League match against Bayer Leverkusen, 4 in the league against Valencia and a hat-trick for Argentina in a friendly in Switzerland.If you have any questions on the methodology or the results of this analysis, you can contact the author on Twitter or via email

Its shares fell 19.7 per cent to $5.33.Capital One posted its biggest share rise in more than four years after credit-card and car lending gains helped it beat revenue and profit estimates. Shares climbed 8.3 per cent to $81.12 on the news.To contrast, American Airlines’ earnings beat failed to cheer investors, with its shares shedding 0.7 per cent to $45.67. Adjusted profits beat market estimates but sales fell short.Elsewhere, General Motors investors shrugged off claims from Swiss researchers that one of GM’s popular diesel models had breached emissions limits, which the company’s European subsidiary has denied.GM shares climbed 1.4 per cent to $35.93, continuing momentum from GM’s earnings beat earlier this week.
33;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-09-30T05:00:19Z;Digital option not for faint-hearted leaders;To win, you need to rethink priorities and processes;"Digital transformation is not for a faint-hearted leadership team. Indeed, the authors of a recent study by Deloitte, the management consultancy, and MIT Sloan Management Review, the business journal, suggest that risk-taking needs to become the cultural norm for companies with digital aspirations.“For every Google, Amazon or Facebook taking major risks, hundreds of companies are still playing it safe,” says Phil Simon, a report contributor and business author.In doing so, they are simply giving digital disrupters further opportunities to outpace them. “Today, the costs of inaction almost always exceed the costs of action,” Mr Simon says.Textbook cases of businesses that paid the ultimate price for failing to anticipate the effects of digitisation would include Borders bookstores, Blockbuster video shops and Kodak, the photographic technology company.In the UK, WM Morrison supermarkets did not introduce online shopping until 2014, forcing it into a painful game of catch-up with digitally-savvy competitors such as Tesco and Waitrose.The pace of digital disruption is “sweeping, breathtaking and accelerating,” said Richard Fairbank, chief executive of Capital One, in a July earnings call about the US bank’s second-quarter results. “To win in the digital world, we can’t simply bolt . . . channels on to the side of our business or [transfer] analogue banking services to digital channels.” Instead, digital must become the centrepiece of the bank’s strategy.Some business leaders, however, seem happy to simply add digital channels to existing systems and processes. The danger with this kind of thinking, say experts, is it allows digital disrupters to maintain their technological lead. Businesses such as Uber, Airbnb and Netflix were built on — and for — the digital age and have mobile and social media technologies at their heart.Such newcomers do not have older systems and processes to worry about, and can focus on fine-tuning customers’ digital experiences. As a consequence, they will continue to disrupt more established and less agile competitors.Martin Gill, an analyst with Forrester Research, an advisory firm, says digitally focused companies need to put their organisation’s purpose and underlying business model first.Too often, he says, established companies find themselves hampered by existing ways of doing things.Philippe Trichet, digital expert director at Boston Consulting Group, the business consultancy, agrees: “Companies need to be prepared to change everything — how they think and how they breathe.” In his previous role as vice-president of customer experience at Schneider Electric, the industrial equipment company, Mr Trichet was involved in a digital transformation project that involved 30,000 employees in more than 90 countries.“What made a big difference for us was that we had clear goals and the effort was led from the top,” he says.Companies need to be prepared to change everything — how they think and how they breatheFrom the chief executive down, a common vision of the benefits the management wanted to achieve was communicated to staff. Says Mr Trichet: “It was made clear that digital transformation would affect everyone, so everyone needed to be involved in delivering it.”The project was deemed a success, despite significant challenges, including a large legacy IT estate and the need to join up fragmented sales, marketing and customer support processes.The programme, says Mr Trichet, was not just about rolling out new IT projects, but about rethinking business processes to achieve greater agility, lower costs and greater customer satisfaction.He adds that it resulted in increased revenues from cross-selling, improved satisfaction from routing customer service online, and increased efficiency by consolidating 145 call centres into 45.Too much focus on technology, not enough on change management — that was what scuppered this initiative, according to an investigation by consultancy PwC.The programme, which was cancelled in May 2013 and resulted in an asset writedown of £100m, lacked an executive steering committee to assess progress against agreed measures of quality, time and cost.The project “focused on technology risks and issues, rather than [driving] operational change to business practices in the BBC”, said PwC.According to a mid-2014 report from Capgemini Consulting, this US bank “has an unflinching focus on digital”, with about 75 per cent of its customer interactions now handled digitally.The bank has also been buying talent: in 2014, it acquired Adaptive Path, a San Francisco specialist in high-tech user experience design; in July it bought Monsoon, a Californian digital design company. “With its radical digital approach, Capital One is not just challenging its own wisdom, but that of the entire financial services industry,” say the authors of Capgemini’s report.In 2013, Co-op Bank cancelled an IT transformation programme resulting in a £300m investment write-off. This became a part of Sir Christopher Kelly’s independent review into the bank’s crippling capital shortfall. The project’s problems, he wrote, included “changes to leadership, a lack of appropriate capability, poor co-ordination, over-complexity, under-developed plans in continual flux and poor budgeting.”Co-op Bank has since launched a £60m digital catch-up scheme that has had its own problems, according to consultancy Verdi.UK retailer John Lewis has been one of the most successful companies in the fightback against online retailers, creating a “bricks and clicks” experience. Online sales account for about 33 per cent of revenues.While half its customers buy in store, the rest combine experiences through hybrid services that let customers buy online but collect in store.Last Christmas, group sales were up 5.8 per cent year on year to £777m in the five weeks to December 27, helped by a 19 per cent rise in the value of online sales year on year."
34;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
35;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-09-09T21:48:52Z;Finance heavyweights invest in blockchain start-up;Visa and Nasdaq see potential for the technology to transform financial services;A group of financial industry heavyweights, including Visa and Nasdaq, are investing in a blockchain start-up in the latest example of enthusiasm around the technology’s potential beyond the transfer of Bitcoins.Banks, clearing houses and exchanges have become excited at the prospect of blockchain fundamentally transforming their business models.Blockchain is a new model for transferring financial assets that uses cryptographically secured networks instead of myriad third-party intermediaries.Supporters believe its broad application in financial services can speed up settlement times, reduce costs and cut counterparty risk.Visa, Nasdaq and Citi Ventures — a part of Citigroup that invests in financial services start-ups — joined Capital One, Fiserv and Orange in participating in a $30m equity financing round for Chain, a company that helps financial institutions build blockchain networks. No valuation was given.“Blockchain technology represents a fundamental, generational shift for financial services, and Chain’s platform is enabling and accelerating this transformation,” said Ramneek Gupta, co-head of global venture investing at Citi Ventures. “We hope to leverage Chain’s platform to rapidly test and develop applications as part of Citi’s multi-faceted blockchain strategy which has the potential to greatly enhance our customers’ experience well beyond just currencies and payments.”Chain’s new investors will also form a working group with the company, which launched just over a year ago, to explore the application of the technology in various markets.Jim Robinson, a former chief executive at American Express, is joining Chain’s board of directors, the company also said on Wednesday.Nasdaq already has said it will use Chain’s blockchain technology to underpin its new private share-trading market, in one of its most high-profile applications to date. Former New York Stock Exchange chief Duncan Niederauer and former JPMorgan banker Blythe Masters have also lent their support to start-ups exploring its use.Former Merrill Lynch executive Bob Wigley recently hailed the cost-cutting potential of bitcoin and the technology underpinning the controversial currency.The group’s former head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa called bitcoin a potential “leading global payments system”, saying he had invested an undisclosed amount in Blockchain, a UK-based company that derives its name from the underlying technology, and was now advising the group.Blockchain claims to be the leading supplier of consumer bitcoin “wallets” — software used for receiving and making payments with the currency. Last year, the company raised $30m in funding from investors including Sir Richard Branson, Lightspeed Ventures and Wicklow Capital, which at the time was the largest single funding round by a bitcoin business.
36;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-08-27T15:17:02Z;Oil price fall hits Canada’s big banks;Jump in bad loan provisions drags down company earnings;Canada’s biggest banks have warned of more troubles to come from the fall in the oil price, as they reported surges in bad loans and chilling effects on consumer demand in the world’s 11th-largest economy.So far the big lenders such as Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank have kept a lid on writedowns by assuming a recovery in the price of crude, while borrowers have continued to service loans by cutting spending and tapping bond and equity markets where they can.But signs of strain are emerging. On Thursday morning TD Bank said oil and gas impairments in the third quarter to the end of July rose by about two-thirds from the second quarter to C$35m, while CIBC said they rose by a third to C$34m. Earlier in the week RBC had said that impairments in its energy portfolio roughly quadrupled to C$183m in the third quarter, while Bank of Montreal revealed a similar rise, to C$106m.The banks also warned of a loss of consumer confidence in parts of the country dependent on oil, such as the “prairie provinces” of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In a call with analysts, RBC chief David McKay said that some of the group’s overall growth had been offset by “low activity” in oil-exposed regions. While some of that slowdown was from a state of “hypergrowth”, he said, “we do recognise these markets remain vulnerable to lower oil prices”.Canadian banks have October year-ends, meaning the figures for the May-July period provide some of the first glimpses into the effects of the latest fall in the price of crude, which has tumbled about 60 per cent in the past 12 months.The results could foreshadow problems for the big US lenders, which report results for the July-September quarter in mid-October. During the first six months of the year, rising non-performing loan ratios were mostly confined to lenders with outsized oil and gas exposures, such as Comerica and Capital One, noted Barclays.Stock market rally and pipeline outages stoke upswing.Continue readingBut twice-yearly reviews are coming up in September, when banks reassess the quality of their loans by projecting likely cash flows from borrowers’ oil reserves. Analysts say banks are unlikely to be as relaxed as they were in April, when many assumed a bounceback in the price of oil. RBC, for example, expected the average annual price to be $53 in 2015 in April, rising to the mid-$60s over time. The average so far this year is $55, but this month it has fallen to $43.“Should oil prices remain below $45, we would expect to see further challenges,” said Mark Hughes, RBC’s chief risk officer.Energy loans account for about 9 per cent of the big five Canadian banks’ aggregate corporate loan book. The last of the big five, Scotiabank, reports on Friday.Reported losses so far are “the tip of the iceberg”, said Meny Grauman, a banks analyst at Cormark Securities in Toronto. Remedial measures such as cost-cutting and mergers between struggling operators can only go so far, he said. “I think there is a lot of scepticism in the market about how much more those kind of actions are available, and whether the banks can delay more significant losses,” he added.
37;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-08-16T23:01:44Z;TD Bank bets on US branches as rivals cut back;Toronto-based lender bucks trend by putting its faith in the power of bricks and mortar;If you are idling away time in a TD Bank branch, try throwing some change in the free TD coin-counter. If your children are nagging, let them play on the jukebox-like quiz machine. If your dog fidgets, toss it a TD biscuit.It is all part of the service at TD, the Toronto-based lender that is still a big believer in the power of bricks and mortar. In the 12 months to the end of April, TD opened more branches across the US than it closed, defying an industry-wide trend. Across the five boroughs of New York City, the lender with C$1tn in assets recently eclipsed Bank of America by branch count — a strategic goal it had set at the annual meeting in 2012 — and is closing in on the top three of Chase, Citi and Capital One.“The physical presence continues to be central to our customers’ needs in many ways,” says chief executive Bharat Masrani, during an interview in a flagship branch opposite Sony’s headquarters on Madison Avenue.He describes an “omni-channel experience”, where a person could start a loan application in the morning on an iPad, pick it up again on an iPhone on the train, then walk into a store at lunch to close the deal. “How can we make that experience seamless?”TD’s belief in the branch is not unusual. Unlike in the UK and parts of Europe, for example, where banks have spent years slimming down networks, US banks have tended to want to “put branches on every street corner”, says David Haber, chief executive of Bond Street, an online lender to small businesses.It is only recently, in fact, that the tide has turned. Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shows the total US branch-count falling each year since a peak of 99,550 in 2009, dropping to 94,725 as of June 2014.But for many of the big banks, the pace of closures is beginning to pick up. JPMorgan Chase wants to cut about 6 per cent of its retail footprint by the end of next year, eliminating a net 300 branches in the process. Citigroup reduced its US branch count by 7 per cent in the 12 months to June. It is now focused on six cities, down from 14, pulling out of markets such as Dallas and Houston altogether.Analysts say that some lenders are eyeing a gradual return to more normal monetary policy from the US Federal Reserve, which could catch banks with big branch networks on the hop.There’s no two ways around it — banks do not need the densities they used to“We suspect that when [interest] rates do rise, technology will allow depositors to move their money to high interest rate accounts with a speed never before seen,” wrote Frederick Cannon, global director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a recent report.Bob Meara, a senior analyst at Celent in New York, says that simple pressure from shareholders for higher returns should result in faster shrinkage of costly branch networks. “There’s no two ways around it — banks do not need the densities they used to. The scales will have to tip.”Mr Masrani, whose rise to chief executive last November capped a 35-year career with TD, does not worry that his network-building puts him out of step with the industry. He notes that, with 1,302 US branches in April — a slight increase from 1,297 a year earlier — TD is still 10th by total branch count, well behind the likes of Chase, with 5,504.He also sees plenty of scope for “optimisation” of TD’s US network, which after acquisitions in 2004 and 2008 stretches down the entire East Coast, from Maine to Florida. TD is now experimenting with “five, six or seven” different formats for its branches, Mr Masrani says, up from just one or two a few years ago. In Baltimore, for example, it recently opened its first teller-less branch, about one-third smaller than the previous default size, featuring three high-tech cash machines and a handful of “financial services associates” to help customers use the machines.The important thing is to “wow” the customer, says Mr Masrani, 59, who ran TD divisions in India and Europe before overseeing the bank’s expansion in the US. He notes that every new employee does at least one course at TD University, a purpose-built campus in Mt Laurel, New Jersey, to learn the TD way. All staff are encouraged to use the phrase, “TD Bank, America’s most convenient bank” like a mantra. (The chief executive does so himself about half a dozen times during the interview.)That is why the openings will continue. When it cut the ribbon last month on a new branch on the corner of Grand St and Allen St on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, TD brought its New York branch tally to 127. It has committed to opening another 10 by the end of the year, and may consolidate a few others. However, its chief executive cautions that the pace of expansion in the US may be held back as the falling oil price could affect the bank’s earnings power in its home market.“We may build a new location and bring business to that location if there is a better look and feel to it, and it has better technology,” says Mr Masrani. “But that doesn’t mean we are not committed to our physical presence, because that is central to what we do.”

GE Capital’s healthcare unit provides financing to companies, investors and developers across various sectors of the industry, including hospitals, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.The McLean, Virginia-based bank is among a group of second-tier lenders to have built aggressively since the financial crisis, taking advantage of turmoil at global banks subject to strategic overhauls and tougher regulatory regimes. Capital One’s total assets of $311bn at the end of June were roughly double the pre-Lehman level, pumped up by deals such as the 2012 acquisition of ING’s online banking businesses in the US.“This is a strategic investment in a specialty industry segment that we have been building out for the past several years,” said Michael Slocum, president of Capital One’s commercial banking division. “This addition will catapult us to a leading market position in providing financial services to the healthcare sector.”GE’s sale of its healthcare financing unit will help America’s best-known conglomerate meet its commitment of selling nearly $200bn of assets at its finance unit as part of a shake-up.Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive who succeeded Jack Welch more than 13 years ago, said in April that the conglomerate would dispose of most of its financial services operations to help the group return to its industrial roots.This addition will catapult us to a leading market position in providing financial services to the healthcare sectorThe tougher regulatory framework that emerged in response to the economic crisis, including higher capital ratios and curbs on risky loans, had made it less profitable for the conglomerate to run GE Capital.Ultimately the inability to boost margins and the division’s negative impact on the rest of the business led Mr Immelt to agree to a staggered sale, which is expected to take about two years.The sale of the healthcare financing business follows GE Capital’s sale of its private equity lending unit to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $12bn in June.In April, when the sale plan was announced, GE sold the majority of its real estate portfolio to Blackstone and Wells Fargo for $26.5bn.It still has to sell most of its US and international commercial lending business as well as its global consumer business. Wells Fargo is seen as a potential buyer of some of these assets, according to people familiar with the negotiation process.
39;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-03-15T18:02:17Z;Week ahead: Fed looms large;UK Budget, Israeli election and Iran talks expected to dominate the week;"The US Federal Reserve looms large over a busy week ahead.Investors will be scrutinising the next statement from the Federal Reserve as debate rages over when the central bank will raise rates. While investment banks for the most part expect an increase in June, markets continue to wager that it will not arrive until September or October.Outside Washington, attention will centre on the UK budget, Israeli elections and the next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme. Below are a few of the main events to watch in the week ahead.Federal ReserveThe US central bank will hold a critical meeting this week after laying the groundwork earlier this year for the first rate rise since the financial crisis. Economists on Wall Street expect the Fed to remove the word “patient” from its policy statement on Wednesday, signalling that the first increase could come in the next few months. Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed will testify following the release.UK BudgetGeorge Osborne, UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers his final budget of this parliament on Wednesday; the country’s general election takes place in May. The budget may include tax cuts in an attempt to soften austerity measures before voters go to the polls in an election whose outcome is hard to predict.Israeli electionIsraelis head to the polls on Tuesday in a hotly contested election between Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Isaac Herzog, the centre-left opposition leader. Mr Herzog is the frontrunner and recent polls showed his alliance, the Zionist Union, three or four seats ahead in its attempt to lead the next coalition government in the Knesset.IranThe next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme begin in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday and are expected to last at least five days. Mohammad Javad, the Iranian foreign minister, will meet John Kerry, US secretary of state, and policy makers from the six world powers to seek an agreement before the self-imposed June deadline.EarningsThe US fourth-quarter earnings season has largely drawn to a close, with just three S&P 500 listed companies yet to report. In the coming week one of the remaining multinationals, Tiffany & Co, will report. First-quarter results will also start to trickle out, with figures due from FedEx, Nike, Oracle, Lennar and General Mills.Outside the US, BMW, Enel, Porsche, Cathay Pacific, Finmeccanica and China Mobile report earnings.The Week That Was, In Four ChartsThe slide in the euro accelerated against the US dollar in the latest week, prompting some investment banks to forecast that the two currencies will go to parity, as the European Central Bank unleashed its bond-buying programme. On Friday the euro dipped below 1.05 to the dollar, a 12-year low.The slide in the euro has provided a fillip for European corporates exposed to the US market; these groups must convert earnings abroad back into the bloc’s currency. That, coupled with the start of quantitative easing, has sent investors piling into European stocks as they exit the US.US equity markets found some comfort from the heady pace of buybacks, which when coupled with dividends surpassed the $900bn mark last year for the first time.

In public, they say that the two-part exam — which became an annual event in 2011 — is proving to be a useful discipline, forcing them to get a much better grip on the particular risks they are facing. Privately, they grumble about overkill, denouncing an opaque and expensive process that takes up too much of management’s time.Continue readingThe Santa Clara, California-based company now expects first-quarter revenues to range between $12.5bn and $13.1bn, compared with earlier forecasts for $13.2bn to $14.2bn. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast the company would report sales of $13.7bn in the quarter to the end of March.“The company believes the changes to demand and inventory patterns are caused by lower than expected Windows XP refresh in small and medium business and increasingly challenging macroeconomic and currency conditions, particularly in Europe,” the company said in a statement, referring to the Microsoft software.Microsoft shares slid 2 per cent to $41.02.Overall, the gains by the financial sector, along with a larger than expected slide in initial jobless claims, buoyed the wider market.The S&P 500 climbed 1.3 per cent to 2,065.95, returning to the level at which it opened the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.5 per cent to 17,895.22.

41;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2015-01-27T12:57:40Z;Compensation for customers of mis-sold card insurance;FCA agrees package with card issuers;"Bank customers who were mis-sold credit card protection products are set to receive compensation this year, following an agreement between the Financial Conduct Authority, high street banks and credit card issuers.Card security products have traditionally been marketed to customers as insurance to cover fraudulent use if a card was lost or stolen. However, the regulator said this was unnecessary because the customer’s card issuer was typically responsible for any transactions after the cards were reported as being lost or stolen and, in the period before reporting the matter, customers were only liable for unauthorised transactions in limited circumstances.Around two million customers are set to receive a letter from the compensation scheme, called “A1 Scheme Ltd”, outlining how to make a claim against their bank.However, the regulator said that for compensation to be paid out the scheme must be voted on by eligible customers and formally approved by the High Court. If the majority of customers who were sold the products vote in favour of the redress scheme then payouts could be made later this year.The amount of compensation paid will depend on how many eligible customers decide that they wish to claim compensation and the length of time they held the product. The average annual cost of the card security product was £25.Complaints received about financial services companies fell by 5 per cent in the first half of 2014 but payment protection insurance remained the most complained about financial product. Barclays attracted the highest number of complaints in the data published by the Financial Conduct Authority on Thursday, though its total complaints fell by 10 per cent compared to the second half of 2013.Continue reading“If approved, this scheme will provide those who may have concerns about the way their card security product was sold to them with a simple and free way to claim compensation,” said Tracey McDermott, director of supervision and authorisations at the FCA, who added that the scheme would provide access to a helpline and website.The six products that can be claimed on are Card Protection, Sentinel, Sentinel Gold, Sentinel Protection, Sentinel Excel and Safe and Secure Plus.The issuers and providers who have voluntarily entered the scheme so far include Affinion, AIB Group (trading as First Trust Bank in Northern Ireland and Allied Irish Bank (GB) in the rest of the UK); Barclays Bank; Capital One; Clydesdale Bank; HSBC; Lloyds; Northern Bank trading as Danske Bank; Santander; Tesco Personal Finance; The Co-operative Bank; and The Royal Bank of Scotland.The compensation scheme is open to all customers who bought or renewed card security products between January 14 2005 — when the FCA began regulating the sale of general insurance products — and August 2013, but it will not cover those who have a card security product as a benefit within a packaged account.Those customers eligible for compensation will receive the amount they have paid for the policy, less any money paid out by the product, plus 8 per cent annual interest on the amount owed.The scheme is separate from, but similar in design to, the redress scheme in respect of CPP Group, another issuer of card insurance products. A total of 16 banks could face a bill of £1.3bn to compensate CPP’s seven million customers. CPP was also fined £10.5m, but Affinion will not face enforcement action. It tried to buy CPP in 2012."

They were trading up 13.17 per cent at 371.75p in early afternoon trading in London.WANdisco’s technology makes it possible to ask complex queries of this data and get answers very quickly, rather than doing more traditional, slower analysts. It has invested heavily in technology that harnesses the power of multiple computers in the cloud to let data to be stored and updated almost instantly from many locations, as well as crunched with clever algorithms.The deal with Capital One marks the company’s first foray into the financial services sector. It said the deal will bring in $250,000 a year, covering 30m bank customers and billions of transactions across credit cards, ATMs and mobile phones.However, the company still makes most of its money from storage and collaboration services, but has struggled to sell its more exciting analytics product to clients, despite conducting pilot trials with customers including British Gas and University of California Irvine.David Richards, chief executive, said the contract represented a new phase of moving from trials to full-blown implementations, adding the coming months were likely to bring in several more.The market for “big data” and analytics was worth about $14.4bn in 2013, according to research group Gartner and is expected to grow as companies try to get a competitive edge by using digital technology to better understand their customers, businesses and markets.Hortonworks, a major supplier of the open-source database technology known as “Hadoop”, recently filed for an initial public offering at an expected valuation of more than $1bn. It has a partnership with WANdisco that lets the UK company cross-sell products.More than three quarters of chief information officers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa said they were shifting their focus to predictive analytics and actively experimenting with their own data, according to a recent survey by research group Gartner.Aside from the risk aversion of industries such as financial services, one of the problems is that executives are unsure what to do with the masses of information they are collecting, analysts say. Companies such as Fusionex, another Aim-quoted stock, are looking to address this issue by creating intuitive products for visualising data.
43;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Credit card companies report higher lending levels;;Three of the largest US credit card issuers have reported higher levels of lending – prompting analysts to suggest the industry has finally reached a turning point, after the damaging effects of the financial crisis.American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial Services all recorded faster loan growth in their domestic card businesses in May, according to filings posted this week – adding to data showing stronger demand for revolving consumer credit in April.Analysts have been looking for green shoots in the US credit card business ever since banks tightened their lending requirements, in response to the bad debts incurred in the wake of the financial crisis. Consumption has been sluggish in the wake of the recession as households sought to repair their balance sheets. But analysts suggest the revival of credit card debt is another sign that the process is nearing an end – boosting the chances of faster economic growth this year.“I’m pretty convinced we’ve hit this inflection point,” said Donald Fandetti, an analyst at Citigroup. “All of a sudden, consumers feel a little bit better, on top of that – from what we hear anecdotally – we think the banks are increasing credit lines for cardholders.” He now expects loan growth to be somewhere between a little more than zero and 4 per cent.Capital One achieved its first positive loan growth in almost a year in May, with a year-on-year increase of 0.15 per cent. But, stripping out the effect of running-off its HSBC credit portfolio acquisition and other purchases, its core loan growth was 1 per cent, Citigroup’s analysts said – the first acceleration since before the credit crisis.At Amex, US card loans grew 6.1 per cent year on year, beating Barclays analysts’ estimates of 3.4 per cent and the previous month’s increase of 5.4 per cent. Meanwhile, at Discover, domestic card loan growth accelerated 6.3 per cent in May compared with 5.3 per cent the month earlier.These increases comes after a strong increase in revolving consumer credit across the broader US economy. In April, the monthly increase in outstanding revolving credit reached 12.3 per cent on an annualised seasonally-adjusted basis, according to the Federal Reserve.“While total consumer debt has been growing, there’s been almost no revolving, credit card loan growth ever since we bottomed, post-recession,” noted Mark DeVries, analyst at Barclays in New York.However, card issuers have found that US consumers are becoming more comfortable with credit card debt, and instances of falling behind with payments – known as delinquencies – have slowed as cardholders skip fewer paymentsMay’s Master Trust data – which also captures the performance of US banks’ securitised credit card portfolios– showed that average delinquency ratios in May were at a ten-year low of 2 per cent.Credit cards remain a profitable business for banks and card companies. Securitised portfolios of credit card debt currently yield around 18 per cent on average – which is historically low, but still rewarding for banks when their own borrowing costs are cheap.“I don’t think anybody is so optimistic to think we’ll get back to double-digit growth like we had before the recession,” said Matthew Burnell, bank analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. “But, it looks like credit card balance growth is starting to become a bit more obvious.”Additional reporting by Robin Harding
44;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2014-04-09T20:44:12Z;BofA agrees $772m credit card settlement;;For Bank of America’s credit card customers, paying a little extra to the bank was a means to protect themselves against the worries of meeting card payments if they lost their job or became ill.But US regulators found the bank had misled more than a million customers over products that were meant to make them feel more financially secure, in some cases charging them without giving them the promised protection or making the benefits sound much better than they were.BofA on Wednesday became the latest big US bank to be fined for tricking customers into buying add-on credit card protection products. It agreed to a $772m settlement with US regulators, the largest of five similar credit card deals to be hammered out by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.“We have seen several cases of deceptive marketing and illegal billing in this market. Here, Bank of America was doing both,” said Richard Cordray, director of the CFPB.The CFPB added that telemarketers “often went off script to make sales pitches that were misleading and that omitted pertinent information”.The settlement covers the sale of two credit protection products, which allowed customers to cancel credit card debt in the case of changing life events, such as involuntary unemployment or going to college.The CFPB found that the bank sold identity protection without having the appropriate permissions from the customer to activate the product. BofA said it had stopped marketing both products by August 2012.Of the $772m levied, the bank will pay only $45m in fines to regulators, with $727m refunded to consumers. The settlement included a $20m payment to the CFPB, the consumer regulator created from the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010, and a $25m penalty to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.BofA said: “The company has already issued refund payments to the majority of affected customers.” The bank neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.We have seen several cases of deceptive marketing and illegal billing in this market. Here, Bank of America was doing bothLast year, JPMorgan Chase had to refund $309m to customers and pay an $80m fine to settle allegations it wrongly charged consumers for credit monitoring programmes that they did not actually receive. Credit card companies American Express, Discover Financial and Capital One have also agreed to settlements with the CFPB.BofA’s worst offences included misleading customers that the first 30 days of coverage were free of charge. In fact, they were charged for the products and then refunded if they cancelled within a 30-day period, according to the CFPB. The bank also told that they faced further steps to activate a product when in fact they had already been enrolled and were paying for the products, the CFPB said.The regulator said the bank went as far as to promise a $25,000 “death benefit”, allowing customers to believe that this benefit was automatic when in reality customers had to submit paperwork and secure approval.BofA last month agreed to a $9.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency over misleading mortgage sales practices.
45;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2014-04-03T23:11:51Z;BofA in talks to pay $800m in credit card case;;Bank of America is in talks to pay about $800m to settle allegations it misled customers who were sold additional credit card products, in what could mark the largest settlement yet levied by the US’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Discussions are continuing and a final deal has not yet been reached between BofA and the consumer regulator, which was created from the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010, people familiar with the matter said. BofA and the CFPB declined to comment.The regulator has been cracking down on companies accused of selling add-on credit card products to consumers without being transparent about the costs. The regulator, under director Richard Cordray, has been increasingly flexing its muscles across consumer banking – from mortgage servicing practices to credit card sales.A final agreement with BofA would mark an important step in its broader investigation that started with enforcement against Capital One in July 2012.Last year, JPMorgan Chase had to refund $309m to customers and pay an $80m fine to settle allegations it wrongly charged consumers for credit monitoring programmes that they did not actually receive.JPMorgan’s case related to an offering at the bank to monitor customers’ credit and alert them to potentially fraudulent activities. Some customers were charged for the service but never authorised the process as is required by law and hence never received the benefits.GE’s retail finance business, Synchrony, has also warned of the threat of regulatory uncertainty, particularly from the CFPB, as it prepares for its initial public offering.Credit card companies American Express and Discover Financial have also agreed to settlements with the CFPB.The $2.2tn US credit card industry is particularly competitive and as post-crisis regulation has been implemented banks have looked to rewards programmes to differentiate themselves from their rivals.Card issuers are positioning themselves to benefit from the early stages of economic recovery, as improving credit quality and consumer confidence are translating into lower defaults and higher spending on cards.The CFPB has also targeted non-bank mortgage servicers such as Ocwen Financial over concerns about the treatment of ‘underwater borrowers’, or borrowers whose mortgages are larger than the value of their house.The largest non-bank mortgage servicing company in the US reached a $2.1bn deal with state and federal authorities to resolve allegations that it took advantage of homeowners, provided false information and charged unauthorised fees.However, the agreement included a commitment to reduce principal balances for underwater borrowers by $2bn over the next three years. Principal forgiveness does not cost Ocwen “other than the operating expense incurred in arranging the modification”, the company said.
46;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2013-11-28T11:54:24Z;Tech groups tap big data on small businesses to smooth financing;;As the plight of small businesses struggling to borrow money climbs up the political agenda in Europe and the US, a number of technology companies believe the solution lies in helping banks gain better access to companies’ financial data.One such company, Intuit, believes it also provides an opportunity to sell more of its QuickBooks accounting software to small businesses.The Nasdaq-listed company has signed on Capital One and Wells Fargo, two of the top five lenders to SMEs by volume in the US, to a pilot programme designed to help financial institutions get a better sense of their customers’ creditworthiness.The platform, known as QuickBooks Financing, has facilitated 400 loans worth $13m in the eight months that it has been live, and will be expanded to Canada in the next two months.“It’s very new, it’s a test,” said Jim Seitz, a spokesman at Wells Fargo. “We’re always looking for new ways to lend to small businesses.”Potential borrowers can visit the platform for free and answer 15 questions to match them to a lender. If the business is one of the 1.2m QuickBooks customers who have uploaded their back-office data to Intuit’s servers, they can give permission for Intuit’s algorithms to analyse that information. In exchange, they are likely to receive preferential rates from the participating banks.“Most small businesses borrow from their family and they’ve maxed out their credit cards,” says Intuit chief executive Brad Smith.“We’re able to go inside your small business accounting, we can look at how many bills you’ve paid on time, who owes you money, and how your cash flow looks, and we’ve been able to write algorithms that will predict your credit risk.”US banks currently mostly use credit bureaus, the small business financial exchange, as well as FICO and their own proprietary measures to determine credit scores.Richard Preece, director of the QuickBooks business, says that the product makes Intuit’s core software offering more attractive. “We’re using QuickBooks data to reduce the lender’s risk and pass those savings back on to the customer,” he says. “It clearly makes QuickBooks more valuable because it’s only by using QuickBooks that you can use this service.”He notes that the volume of loans that pass through the system may allow new relationships to emerge from the data. For example, Intuit has found that the number of vendors paid in the preceding six months is a good indicator of whether a business can pay down its loans, while the number of customers on its books is not.Intuit’s share price has risen 20 per cent since the end of June, as it has increased its focus on cloud computing and mobile applications. Its revenues grew 9.5 per cent year-on-year to the end of July 2013 to $4.17bn, while net income rose 8.3 per cent to $858m.FT writers dissect the corporate race to turn data into profitThe move is the latest sign that financial institutions and software providers are harnessing the power of cloud computing and data analytics to improve their services and minimise their risk.Earlier this year a North American subsidiary of Sage, Intuit’s British-based competitor, announced a new tool that analyses multiple data points to help businesses cross-sell to customers.But established players such as Sage and Intuit increasingly face competition from start-ups.Kabbage, an Atlanta-based start-up with operations in the UK, takes data from Facebook, Twitter and Yelp pages, as well as transaction information from online marketplaces such as Etsy, eBay and Amazon, to help determine a business’s credit profile. Kabbage worked with Intuit on QuickBooks Financing.ZestFinance, started by a former VP of engineering at Google, Douglas Merrill, says loans made on the basis of its number-crunching algorithms result in 40 per cent fewer defaults than those made using other industry scores.Intuit says it has identified around 145 different data points – such as revenue, number of customers and payments to vendors over time – that help predict credit risk better than the blunter measure of a personal credit score.
47;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Credit card boss’s early lesson in debt;Capital One’s UK head says he is growing tired of an industry that punishes some of its customers;"As managing director of a credit card company, US-born Brian Cole might be expected to know a thing or two about debt. Indeed, he understands it only too well: as a naïve student in Virginia, he fell behind with credit card repayments after struggling to pay tuition fees and rent.“It meant I couldn’t afford to buy suits for interviews or buy a car,” Mr Cole recalls. “My family had never taken on debt so it was a new experience for me and showed me that people don’t choose to get into these circumstances.”Now managing director of Capital One UK, Mr Cole’s own experience shaped his views of the multiple reasons people can fall into debt, from marriage breakdown to job loss and hectic lives.A subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation in the US, the UK headquarters in Nottingham opened in 1997. Today, Capital One has 40m customers around the world and employs 30,000 people globally. In the UK, the company is a top 10 credit card issuer and has 3m customers.Mr Cole describes how Capital One strives to create lasting relationships with its customers. He believes matching the right card to the right person is at the heart of responsible lending and says he is tired of an industry that punishes people.“There’s a real moral dilemma facing the industry,” he explains, revealing his frustration. “We can all do much better.“If stakeholders say they don’t trust the industry, that takes a lot of unwinding which is also costly. We need to reset business models so there is a much more customer-centric approach.“Internally, we’ve managed to change our perspective regarding our relationship with stakeholders like regulators and consumer advocates. They speak for the customer so that is critical for us. Now, we have much more ongoing contact with opinion formers such as Which?. We were also pleased to have been shortlisted for the Which? Best Financial Services Provider award 2012.”Mr Cole’s wish to “do some social good” also extends to the CSR programme he has spearheaded. One element of this is to teach money management to 13 and 14-year-olds, when it is still early enough to influence their thinking.“It’s tough to tap into their mindset,” he says, “so we have to relate the issue to something they understand, such as their mobile phone ownership. We also partner with YouthNet, a non-profit company, which has developed an online resource to help 16-25-year-olds. A recent visit by visionary Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus will help us to stimulate creativity in our CSR programme.”Mr Cole talks with the enthusiasm of a new recruit, in spite of being at Capital One since 1997 and taking over as UK managing director in 2009. He talks with the same passion about the leadership models in his early life.Born in Fairfax, Virginia – in the same hospital as his artist wife Dana – Mr Cole’s first role model was his French Armenian paternal grandmother who had emigrated from Marseilles.A “real fighter”, some of her battles were on behalf of the feminist movement in its early stages. She also wanted all her five children to be ambitious – and it paid off. They are chief executives, poets and architects. Mr Cole’s father, the oldest, fought in the first Gulf war and other conflicts, becoming a decorated colonel in the US Marine Corps.As a child, Mr Cole was inspired – and is still inspired today – by Joe Gibbs, a leadership figure in the local Washington Redskins football team: “Joe had a strong character, real authenticity and some vulnerability. He was willing to show emotion and had robust values. When I got into the workplace, he helped me emulate the type of leader I wanted to become.”After attending Virginia Tech university, Mr Cole graduated with a communications degree before going back to study for a business degree at 24. His first job was with the First Union Bank but he felt he hit a “glass ceiling” with nowhere to progress to after a year. This led him to join Capital One in 1997 and he moved to the UK with his wife in 2005 to become chief financial officer of Capital One Europe.Mr Cole attributes some of his business success to finding the right individual for each role, even if they are from other disciplines. He describes Capital One as quite “marketing centric” with many of its leaders coming from the marketing side. He is adamant you need to give people the space they need to develop and “trust them to get on with it – or they do not get the opportunity to stretch”.The company gives staff the chance to move laterally across functional areas to broaden their skillset: the current chief operating officer was previously head of legal and the head of brand was the former head of corporate affairs.His own leadership development experiences have given him a firm belief that clarity of vision is the difference between effective management and leadership.Still an extension of the US parent company, Mr Cole suggests Capital One UK has the benefits of being a large company but with a powerful start-up culture that belies its size. More than 65 per cent of the company’s 1,000 UK staff have stayed for six years or more with more than 35 per cent accruing 11 years service.Mr Cole is proud that the company has been certified as one of Britain’s top employers in the CRF Institute’s 2012 Top Employers to Work For poll and was ranked second in last year’s Great Places to Work survey.As for the future, Mr Cole has a clear view of what is needed: “Increasingly, people want to work for a company committed to doing some social good. Our vision of improving lives and engaging our staff in this so strongly means we can all benefit long-term.”

48;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2013-01-23T17:47:26Z;US credit card-backed issues soar;;Lenders are taking advantage of investor confidence in bonds backed by American credit card debt, which has grown thanks to the prudence of the US consumer and the falling number of personal bankruptcies.Capital One is the latest bank selling securities backed by the credit card balances of its customers, returning to the securitisation market for the first time since 2009. It has begun marketing $750m of credit card debt to investors, arranged through JPMorgan.The improving quality of the underlying collateral has sparked a surge in interest in credit card-backed bonds. The number of Americans who declared bankruptcy has fallen for two consecutive years and, according to a new forecast from the credit rating agency Fitch Ratings, will fall again in 2013.Meanwhile, the number of delinquent borrowers is close to record low levels, encouraging investors to bid up for bonds backed by pools of credit card balances.Spreads on credit card asset backed securities (ABS) have narrowed almost to the levels seen at the peak of the securitisation boom in 2007, meaning investors are demanding less of a premium over safer bonds such as US Treasuries.Michael Dean, analyst at Fitch, is forecasting a further 6 or 7 per cent fall in personal bankruptcies in the US this year. Bankruptcy filings totalled 1,157,491 in 2012, a 14.5 per cent decline from 2011, and more than Fitch was forecasting.“It may seem backwards but when economic times are tough, people get more prudent with their finances,” said Mr Dean. “People pay down debt when they fear they may lose their job in the next year.”Credit card delinquency and chargeoff levels reached new lows in 2012, though these may tick back higher in 2013, Fitch suggests, as lenders relax standards that have been very tight since the credit crisis.Joe Astorina, a consumer ABS strategist at Barclays, said the positive performance of the credit card pools reflects a “purge” of less creditworthy borrowers when defaults spiked in the recession, leaving customers with lower balances and a higher chance of meeting their payments.According to a Barclays index, yields on credit card ABS are now less than 0.4 percentage points higher than Treasuries, similar to 2006 levels, thanks to strong investor demand. Fund managers have sought safe assets that yield more than rock-bottom interest rates on government debt.Last year, lenders sold $39.5bn of credit card debt into the US ABS market, in 55 deals, up from $14.9bn in 26 deals in 2011, Dealogic figures show.“It is an attractive funding source for lenders,” Mr Astorina said. “Credit card issuers who have been using deposits to fund their lending are re-engaging with the securitisation market for diversification of funding.”
49;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2013-01-22T21:42:36Z;Bank security study highlights vulnerabilities;;More than two-thirds of banks have suffered at least one Distributed Denial of Service attack in the past 12 months, according to independent research conducted by the US-based Ponemon Institute.DDoS attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers and aim to make a machine or network resource unavailable to users by saturating the target machine with external communications requests. They have become an increasingly popular tool among “hacktivist” groups and cybercriminals in recent years.The findings of the report commissioned by Corero Network Security, a cybersecurity systems supplier, shed further light on the usually tight-lipped financial services community and highlight the activities of “hacktivist” groups and others that have recently targeted banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Capital One.The latest study, based on the responses of 650 IT and IT security professionals at 351 banks, including from some of the largest in the world, also revealed that most bank cybersecurity professionals expect this type of attack to increase. Of those surveyed, 78 per cent believed that DDoS attacks will continue or significantly increase in the coming year, leaving them vulnerable to cyber attacks that could lead to downtime and compromised data.Almost half of respondents – 48 per cent – said their banks had suffered multiple DDoS attacks in the past 12 months. Along with so-called “Zero-Day” attacks that exploit a previously unknown security vulnerability, DDoS attacks are considered to be the most severe security threats.“It really comes as no surprise that DDoS attacks are one of the most severe security risks cited by the banking industry and these results clearly demonstrate the level to which they are being targeted on a continued basis,” said Larry Ponemon, founder of the Ponemon Institute. “When such an attack occurs, the time and efforts of IT staff are devoted to dealing with the problem instead of managing other IT operational and security priorities. This leaves financial institutions open to more dangerous attacks that further compromise their infrastructure.”Among the problems IT staff face dealing with this attacks, 50 per cent cited insufficient personnel and expertise and a lack of effective security technology as the most serious concerns, followed by insufficient budget resources.Despite the recognition that the threat of DDoS attacks is not abating, the survey revealed that 35 per cent of banks are still predominately relying on previously deployed traditional technology, in particular firewalls, to protect their organisation from today’s sophisticated attacks.“The belief that traditional perimeter security technologies such as firewalls are able to protect against today’s DDoS attacks is lulling not only financial institutions but organisations across every sector into a false sense of security,” said Marty Meyer, president of Corero.“Many organisations assume traditional firewalls can provide protection against DDoS and Zero-Day exploits at the perimeter, yet this is not what they were designed to do and therefore attacks are still getting through.”Corero argues that banks and other vulnerable institutions need to add so-called “first line of defence” security systems that can provide this protection and are able to remove all of the “noise” at the perimeter before it hits the network, so that firewalls and servers can function in the way they were intended to.

The bond market was officially closed on Tuesday.Corporate borrowers also rushed to sell the bonds ahead of market-moving events that could trigger volatility and push borrowing costs higher.US companies have timed new deals opportunistically throughout year, seeking to avoid rapid turnround in markets. Thursday’s “window of opportunity” comes as the Bureau of Labour Statistics said it would proceed with the release of the critical US non-farm payrolls data on Friday – the last of the big economic news before the US presidential election on Tuesday.“The new issue market has come back with a vengeance today as investors were again operational post Sandy and had substantial cash to put to work,” said Greg Hall, managing director in debt capital markets at Barclays.He added that volumes were expected to remain high in November with “some issuers looking to get ahead of that supply, while others are conscious of taking any risk associated with the election off the table”.Thursday’s sales will push the total for US debt issuance over the $1.15tn mark so far this year, the busiest on record for dollar-debt sales, according to Dealogic. The new sales are set to meet strong demand.Investors have favoured corporate bonds as returns have outpaced that of government securities this year.On average, US corporate bonds have returned 10 per cent year-to-date compared with 1.9 per cent for US Treasuries and a 13.1 per cent return for high-yield corporate debt, according to Barclays indices.John Higgins, senior market economist at Capital Economics, said a rally in corporate bonds was beginning to show signs of running out of steam. But corporate debt may continue to benefit from an extended period of potentially open-ended quantitative easing.“In the absence of another recession, such as the one which hit the US in 1937-38 a few years after the Great Depression, a major spike in spreads and yields seems unlikely,” he said.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie
51;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2012-09-10T10:52:06Z;European banks – capital ideas;Three banks take different approaches to raising core tier one ratio;Not what you were looking for? At first glance, recent events at three European banks look to be unrelated. Look closer, however, and they reflect a deeper reality. Who would have expected Deutsche Bank to start its trailed 2,000 job cuts in (of all places) Asia, where it is slashing 10 per cent of equity sales and trading staff just three years after saying it was prioritising the region? Or ING, as a forced seller of ING Direct USA, to pocket €2.3bn from the Capital One Financial Corp stake it received last year in part payment? And how the tables have turned for regulators in Spain, who once had to shield banks from crises in Latin America. Now Santander is listing its unit in Mexico to boost the group’s balance sheet. In reality, all three banks need more capital, but are going about it differently.Deutsche’s core tier one capital ratio of 10.2 per cent at the June half-year equates to a peer-lagging 7.2 per cent by year-end, assuming full adoption of Basel III, which calls for a 7 per cent minimum. The German bank is determined to avoid a cash call, so has to deleverage and, given the grim income outlook, cut costs to boost profits and capital. ING, by contrast, is holding an autumn sale. The recent disposal of ING Direct Canada lifts its core tier one ratio to 11.6 per cent, pre-Basel III. Last week’s sale of the Capital One stake adds 35 basis points. But repayment of ING’s state aid and the associated premium would shrink the ratio to 10.5 per cent. So it still needs capital. In Santander’s case, the listing of its Mexican bank could raise up to $4.3bn, lifting its ratio 50bp to 10.6 per cent, again pre-Basel III. But it still needs to meet the latter and extra property provisions at home.Uniquely, Santander has more flexibility than its European peers. A cash call at home may be tricky. But it can at least raid its coffers in the Americas. Thank Columbus for that. He found what he was looking for.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
52;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2012-07-26T22:44:02Z;Capital One to pay soldiers in settlement;;Capital One Financial has agreed to pay at least $12m to resolve federal allegations that it unlawfully seized the homes and cars of active-duty members of the US military.At least 4,000 service members were harmed, said Thomas Perez, who leads the justice department’s civil rights unit. The alleged violations range from wrongful seizures to improper collections of debt and illegally charging active members of the military higher rates of interest than US law allows.John Finneran, Capital One general counsel, said: “We sincerely apologise and are providing restitution to our impacted customers and will be providing lower rates and greater benefits than the law requires to all eligible service members.”Enforcement actions against banks over allegations of lending abuses perpetrated against members of the US military have increased over the past few years as the justice department and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have placed a renewed focus on service members, who are protected by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.“We are finding a lot of ignorance, and ignorance is not an excuse,” said Mr Perez. “I am hopeful this case will serve as a wake-up call …for the entire industry.”Thomas Curry, head of the OCC, said the bank regulator was increasingly focusing on banks’ operational risks, particularly banks’ relationships with vendors.For lenders, the negative attention that comes from allegations of abuse against members of the military has often led to public apologies and quick settlements.JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America last year reached legal settlements in which they agreed to pay damages to nearly 200 service members who claimed that their homes had been improperly seized.Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, personally apologised last year for lapses.The Capital One settlement comes a week after the lender said it would pay as much as $210m to settle separate US charges that it illegally marketed “add-on” products for its credit cards.Pressure groups have targeted Capital One over alleged lending abuses. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition tried to block the company’s acquisition of ING Direct and HSBC’s US credit card unit in part due to lending concerns. The bank declined to comment on those allegations.Service members will receive checks as part of the US settlement announced Thursday, which covers alleged abuses dating back to 2006.Alleged victims whose homes were improperly repossessed will receive at least $125,000 plus compensation for any lost equity with interest.Service members whose cars were wrongfully seized will receive at least $10,000.US officials noted that Capital One also will be forced to repair damaged credit histories of service members who were allegedly victimised by the lender. Some members of the military are required to have security clearances, which can be revoked due to a poor credit history.
53;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2012-07-18T22:23:39Z;Capital One pays $210m charge;;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau landed its first major enforcement action on Wednesday, when Capital One Financial said it would pay as much as $210m to settle charges that it illegally marketed “add-on” products for its credit cards.The action comes just a few days before the agency, which was created as part of the Dodd-Frank package of financial reforms introduced after the financial crisis, is to celebrate its one-year anniversary as an independent agency. It has been under pressure recently from consumer groups and civil rights organisations to launch a case against a major lender before its first birthday.The CFPB’s new powers have proved to be a divisive issue between Democrats and Republicans. President Barack Obama appointed Richard Cordray as the bureau’s director during last year’s congressional summer recess despite Republican objections. In doing so he overlooked Democrat Elizabeth Warren, who helped build the bureau and is now running for a US Senate seat in Massachusetts.“Today’s action puts $140m back in the pockets of two million Capital One customers who were pressured or misled into buying credit card products they didn’t understand, didn’t want, or in some cases, couldn’t even use,” Mr Cordray said in a statement. “We are putting companies on notice that these deceptive practices are against the law and will not be tolerated.”The $210m figure includes $140m to $150m set aside to refund Capital One customers who were wrongly sold add-ons, a $25m penalty to the CFPB and a $35m to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the bank’s main regulator.The add-ons included “payment protection,” a type of insurance for credit card debt, as well as “credit monitoring” aimed at preventing identify theft. Capital One’s sales team misled customers about the cost and benefits of the products, the CFPB said, and customers were not always told that buying the add-ons was optional.“Capital One’s third party vendors did not always adhere to company sales scripts and sales policies for payment protection and credit monitoring products, and the bank did not adequately monitor their activities,” the company said in a statement.The bank said it discovered the mis-selling, which took place between August 2010 and January 2012, late last year and immediately stopped phone sales of the products. It set aside $75m for refunds when it released first-quarter earnings.The company reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, showing net income fell almost 90 per cent to $92m. The results were impacted by the regulatory settlements and an extra $1.2bn of reserves set aside as part of its acquisition of ING Direct USA and HSBC’s US credit card business.Attorneys representing lenders had been eagerly awaiting the CFPB’s first enforcement action. Industry officials have feared that the agency will take an overly punitive approach, in part to prove to US households that it will take an aggressive approach to enforcement.US bank regulators have been accused of levying soft penalties against banks accused of wrongdoing. The CFPB is keen to avoid such a reputation.
54;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2012-03-19T21:27:32Z;Apple and tech stocks lift US markets;Nasdaq climbs as iPad maker resumes dividend payment;Technology stocks pushed the S&P 500 to another cyclical high on Monday as Apple once again dominated investor attention, saying it would begin making dividend payments for the first time since 1995.Apple, the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, said it would return some of its estimated $100bn cash stockpile to shareholders by making quarterly dividend payments of $2.65 and spending up to $10bn on share repurchases.The shares rose 2.7 per cent to close above the $600 mark at $601.10 for the first time in the company’s history. The consumer technology company also reported “record activity” over the weekend for sales of its latest iPad tablet.Scott Sutherland, analyst at Wedbush, reiterated his “buy” rating and put a price target of $750 on Apple following Monday’s the announcement. “Apple continues to generate significant free cash flow and will be maintaining a cash war chest to execute on strategic opportunities. We are making some minor earnings per share adjustments in [our financial year] 2013 to reflect dividends but not repurchases,” he said.The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to its highest level since May 2008 at 1,409.75 and is now up more than 12 per cent on the year. US Steel Corporation led the risers on the benchmark US index, up 6.5 per cent to $31.64.Financial stocks propelled the index to cyclical heights to start the day but retreated in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 financial sector index gained as much as 1.2 per cent before finishing the day up 0.5 per cent.Bank of America, the best performing big bank stock for the year to date, crossed the $10 mark for the first time since last August in intraday trading, but finished the day down 2.8 per cent to $9.53 as traders speculated on rumours that the bank was going to raise capital through a share offering.“Contrary to market rumours, Bank of America has no intention of issuing additional equity in a secondary offering,” said a spokesperson at Bank of America. Shares rose 1.9 per cent in after-hours trading.Citigroup climbed 1.3 per cent to $37.17 after it sold its stake in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, netting an after-tax profit of $349m. Citigroup has risen almost 2 per cent since last Tuesday’s close when it was revealed that it was one of four banks to fail the Federal Reserve’s stress tests.Goldman Sachs was up 1.1 per cent to $124.30 as reports said the bank was considering offering “monoline” insurance to find new ways to expand its business ahead of new financial regulations.Morgan Stanley rose 2.7 per cent to $20.06, while Wells Fargo gained 1.1 per cent to $34.25. Capital One and the Bank of New York Mellon were both up more than 1 per cent at $55.10 and $24.51 respectively.E-Trade Financial, the electronic broker, was up 1.6 per cent and has now risen 41 per cent in the year to date.The Nasdaq Composite index was the best performer out of the three large US indices as technology stocks picked up momentum throughout the day. The index rose 0.8 per cent to 3,078.32 with Apple among the leaders. Close behind was Google, which added 1.4 per cent to $633.98.The day’s biggest loser was Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator by subscribers, which fell by 4.5 per cent to $2.76. The company was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” in a note by Bernstein Research which cited concerns that Sprint does not have sufficient “free-and-clear spectrum” to launch its latest LTE iPhone and maintains its “punishing” commitments to Apple.Craig Moffett, analyst at Bernstein, said: “Unfortunately, at this point we simply don’t believe there is any analytical framework that provides strong conviction as to whether Sprint can or cannot avoid bankruptcy over the next four years or so.“To be clear, we are not predicting a Sprint bankruptcy. We are merely acknowledging that it is a very legitimate risk. And notwithstanding a recent rally in Sprint shares, we believe that risk is rising,” he added.Priceline.com, the online travel booking company, gained 3.2 per cent to $696.93 to hit a 52-week high. Netflix, the home DVD delivery and online streaming company, continued its rally, up nearly 4 per cent to $114.33.Shares in UPS, the US package delivery company, added 3.4 per cent to $81.11. Over the weekend, the company said it would acquire TNT Express, its Dutch rival, as it plans to expand its footprint in Europe and China.Las Vegas Sands, the casino company, rose 4.5 per cent to a 52-week high at $59.12 on reports that its Sands Cotai Central casino in Macao would open next month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 13,239.13. Bank of America led the index for much of the day before softening in afternoon trading to finish as the index’s worst performer. American Express, the world’s third-largest payments network, gained 1.3 per cent to $57.27.Economic data released on Monday showed that US housing market sentiment remained flat in March, with home builder confidence holding steady from last month.
55;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2012-02-27T20:02:17Z;Dealmakers worried by Fed’s tougher oversight;;"It must stick in the craw for Irish, French, German or Dutch bankers to have to go to the US to flog off assets.Wall Street taught them to leverage their balance sheet and load up on American subprime mortgages. Even if they survived this advice, they now have to raise capital ratios – probably by selling some rather better assets than the bilge they bought in the last decade. And most of the available buyers are American.So BNP Paribas sold a US energy business to Wells Fargo. Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank sold assets, also to Wells. Deutsche Bank is trying to sell its asset management business and Wells and JPMorgan are among those to have looked at it.The only saving grace for European sellers: they have, so far, clung on to crown jewels such as BNP’s Bank of the West retail chain. But the deals that have happened are a further sign that banking globalisation is going into reverse. Even Citigroup, whose executives used to wander around emerging markets on a constant shopping spree, last week sold its stake in HDFC, the Indian lender.One happy side-effect of all this for bank regulators: geographic simplification makes looking after and, when necessary, euthanising lenders a lot easier. But those same regulators are not encouraging acquisitions by US banks. Far from it. Those are now harder than at any point in at least the last 20 years.There are three rules that have made the sorts of big-bank mergers that created today’s Bank of America, Wells Fargo or JPMorgan Chase more difficult.First, the rule that prevents a company growing by acquisition to hold more than 10 per cent of US retail deposits. Second, an accounting change that makes write-offs on acquired bank assets detrimental to capital. Third and most recent, the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of a new “financial stability” proposal.The first rule would prevent BofA, Wells or JPMorgan from buying any other retail bank – they can continue to open branches, but not buy them. A couple of years ago there was some political pressure to raise this limit; that has faded since the financial crisis.The second is an impediment but it is surmountable for the healthiest acquirers – Wells bought Wachovia in 2008, took a big writedown on its assets and absorbed a large hit to its capital.The third is the newest, least understood and could have even wider effects. It was in evidence in two recent deals – Royal Bank of Canada’s sale of its US retail business to PNC and Capital One’s purchase of ING Direct, another case of a European bank selling US assets to an American rival.Bank executives at healthy institutions and their advisers have been poring over the Federal Reserve’s approval of the mergers and they don’t like what they see. “I almost fell off my chair,” said one.Although the Fed approved the deals, they put both banks through the wringer and showed a much more conservative approach to new “financial stability” responsibilities than anyone in the sector thought. If the Fed puts these midsized institutions under so much scrutiny what will it do with bigger banks?From now on, the Fed said in its ruling, it will consider “size” as a factor (not necessarily just existing limits on market share of deposits); “availability of substitute providers”; “interconnectedness”; “extent to which the resulting firm contributes to the complexity of the financial system”; and “extent of the cross-border activities of the resulting firm”. Most of the largest banks would score badly on each of these tests already, never mind with a merger partner.Banking consolidation is still a live issue in a country with more than 7,000 lenders. Conservatism at the Fed on bank mergers is not new. In the 1970s, remembers Rodgin Cohen, a partner at law firm Sullivan and Cromwell and the industry doyen of bank M&A, the Fed had a policy of deterring big mergers. “It changed when the benefits of consolidation became apparent and the flaws in that policy became more apparent,” says Mr Cohen. Then officials became more permissive and allowed the series of mergers that created the modern banking landscape. “It’s been that way until now.”This change of policy is terrible news for those of us with an interest in exciting megamergers – you may be reluctant to shed a tear for acquisitive megabanks, investment bankers, lawyers and journalists. Whether it’s good news for the US economy is a harder question.The turning point won’t be obvious for a while: few of the biggest institutions are either sufficiently desperate sellers or confident enough buyers to put the Fed to the test. But bank dealmakers are worried."
56;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2012-02-15T22:30:55Z;Zynga hit as it fails to justify investor buying;;Shares in Zynga fell on Wednesday, after the social games developer reported record revenue in its first earnings report as a publicly traded company, but did not do enough to justify heavy buying by investors ahead of results.Its shares fell 17.8 per cent to $11.80.The stock had climbed as high as $14.55 on Tuesday, a premium of $4.55 over Zynga’s December initial public offering price, as investors bet that the company, which generated 12 per cent of Facebook’s revenue in 2011, would deliver blockbuster results.Fourth-quarter revenue of $311.2m was up 60 per cent year-on-year, but a $510m charge for stock-based compensation took the gloss off earnings, forcing the company to book a loss. Analysts were underwhelmed.“[Zynga’s result] was about in line [with expectations] but, given its valuation, we don’t think in line is enough to make the stock work,” said Ben Schachter, a tech analyst at Macquarie. “It needed to show a significant top-line beat.”Barclays Capital analysts said the rally in Zynga shares, which has seen the stock climb 26 per cent in 2012, even after Wednesday’s losses are taken into account, might have run its course, and removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock.Elsewhere, US equities suffered one of their worst days of the year, as the S&P 500 fell more than 0.5 per cent for only the third time in 2012, as reports suggested eurozone finance ministers might delay providing additional bail-out funds to Greece, and Greek and German officials faced off through the media.The S&P 500 closed down 0.5 per cent to 1,343.23. But Randy Frederick at broker Charles Schwab urged retail investors to take advantage of the retreat to increase exposure to equities.“Even bull markets tend to go up in stair steps with lots of small pauses and pullbacks along the way. These points … represent ideal points of entry,” he told clients.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, fell 0.8 per cent to 12,780.95, as industrial groups 3M and United Technologies slipped 1.1 per cent to $87.01 and 2.4 per cent to $82.60, respectively.It appeared that investors, who had bought both stocks in order to qualify for quarterly dividends, which were paid to anyone holding shares on Tuesday, were now exiting.The Nasdaq Composite index reached new 11-year highs in the morning session, as Apple shares, which account for a 10th of the index, continued to break new ground.But having climbed 3 per cent to $526.29, Apple shares retreated to $497.67, a fall of 2.3 per cent on the day, on reports that the iPad 2 has been pulled from the Amazon China e-commerce website, because of a trademark dispute over the iPad name.That left the Nasdaq off 0.6 per cent to 2,915.83.Yahoo shares slipped 1.6 per cent to $15.12, after the company’s attempts to sell its Asian investments appeared to break down on Tuesday, triggering a boardroom rebellion by activist investors. JPMorgan analysts, who had argued that a tax-free sale of stakes in companies such as Alibaba could yield a $20 share price bounce for Yahoo, expressed frustration at the drawn-out process.Doug Anmuth told JPMorgan clients: “A taxed sale … remains possible – and we believe that may be better than doing nothing at all – but we think the board and management need to arrive at a conclusion in the near term, so Yahoo can focus fully on its core business.”Kellogg’s surprise acquisition of the Pringles brand from Procter & Gamble sent its shares up 5.1 per cent to $52.87. P&G shares ticked up 0.1 per cent to $64.55 on the news, while Diamond Foods, a long-time suitor for Pringles, whose own bid was scuppered by an accounting probe, climbed 5.2 per cent to $23.46.Bank stocks had rallied strongly in the morning session, after a mini sell-off on Tuesday, but retreated again in the afternoon as Greek worries mounted.Bank of America fell 2.5 per cent to $8.07, as John McDonald at Bernstein Research became the second analyst in as many days to downgrade the stock to the equivalent of “hold” from “buy”, arguing that BofA no longer represents compelling value, given its 45 per cent share price gain so far this year.Citigroup fell 1.1 per cent to $31.72, but Goldman Sachs eked out a 0.3 per cent gain to close at $113.17.Capital One climbed 2.5 per cent to $49.18, after winning approval for its acquisition of ING Direct, the US branch of the Dutch bank.This story has been amended since original publication, because it incorrectly named Tyson Foods as a suitor for the Pringles brand. In fact Tyson has no connection with Pringles and never sought to buy the company.
57;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2012-01-20T22:03:33Z;S&P 500 on cusp of bull market territory;;A week dominated by fourth-quarter results saw tech companies drive a rally that was belatedly joined by bank stocks and left the S&P 500 on the cusp of a bull market.Linear Technology sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks on Wednesday as the company said orders for circuit products had picked up in December and January, paving the way for a strong first quarter of 2012.Linear surged 10 per cent to $33.06 over the week while rivals Advanced Micro Devices, up 13.4 per cent to $6.42, and Jabil Circuit, which climbed 9.3 per cent to $23.00, benefited from the improved sentiment.“Historically, [Linear] has generally been right in guiding investors through the cycle bottoming process …usually seeing changes in demand before peers,” John Pitzer at Credit Suisse told clients.Wireless networking companies joined the rally on Wednesday. F5 Networks defied falling revenues from government clients to beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations.F5 climbed 12.6 per cent to $120.27, while rival Juniper Networks was up 9.2 per cent to $22.99, though some analysts were cautious about excessive valuations.“At over 24 times our full-year 2012-expected earnings per share, we believe more earnings momentum is needed to keep [F5] moving up,” said Rod Hall at JPMorgan.The tech rally accelerated at the end of the week as larger companies reported. Old tech appeared to dominate new as IBM, up 5.2 per cent to $188.52, and Microsoft, up 5.2 per cent to $29.71 outperformed Google, which slid 8.4 per cent on Friday alone to $585.99.On closer inspection, the contrasting share price performances were a result of very different factors.Google shares had climbed 2.3 per cent to the close on Thursday in anticipation of strong fourth- quarter results while Microsoft’s gains came in spite of a 6 per cent fall in sales at its core Windows business: analysts had simply been braced for worse.The tech rally left the Nasdaq Composite index up 2.8 per cent for the week to 2,786.7 while IBM and Microsoft helped the Dow climb 2.4 per cent to 12,720.48.The S&P 500 climbed 2 per cent over the week – now up 4.6 per cent for the year – and is on course for its best January in 15 years. The benchmark index has now climbed 19.7 per cent since its close on October 3, just short of the 20 per cent gain that would indicate a bull market.The CBOE Vix index of volatility in the S&P 500, commonly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, closed below 20 for the first time in almost six months on Thursday before falling to 18.4 on Friday, in a further indicator of bullish sentiment.But market participants warned against excessive optimism, noting high inflows into exchange-traded products that profit from a rise in volatility.“Risk assets have had a nice run of late but at least some investors are hedging their bets,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex.Bank earnings hugged the headlines over the week with investment banks the clear winners as Goldman Sachs climbed 9.9 per cent to $108.74 and Morgan Stanley climbed 10.6 per cent to $18.39 while there was one clear loser – Citigroup slumped 3.6 per cent over the week to $29.27.Investor enthusiasm for investment banking stocks was somewhat surprising, given the abysmal fourth-quarter trading volumes reported by most banks. Morgan Stanley was the one bank to buck the trend, however, while Goldman impressed investors by cutting deeply into costs by reducing staff and pay.“Expectations about pay in the industry have changed but clearly cutting headcount is not something that can be done every quarter,” said JJ Kinahan at TD Ameritrade. “Eventually, US banks need a kinder interest rate environment to generate sustainable earnings growth.”Bank of America climbed 7 per cent to $7.07 over the week, its highest close since October, as it reported a second successive quarter of profit, despite losses at its investment banking business.Credit card companies were the laggards of the financial sector with American Express virtually flat for the week while Capital One fell 5.9 per cent to $46.03 as the company spooked investors with higher than expected costs that pushed profit far below most analyst expectations.Goldman Sachs analysts said “further outperformance” by credit card companies was unlikely, despite several companies reporting an increase in outstanding loans and improving lending margins in the fourth quarter.“Spend volumes decelerated and expenses were elevated,” Goldman told clients.Overall, with 77 companies S&P 500 companies having reported by Friday afternoon, only 55 per cent have beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, one of the lowest rates in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“The market reacts positively to bad news [and] terrible earnings reports are ignored: [these are] signs of a bull market,” worried Mark Ivanhoff at Ivanhoff Capital.The rollercoaster ride continued for investors in Sears Holdings. The department store chain’s market capitalisation halved in the last two months of 2011 after the company announced store closures.But shares rose 46 per cent to $49 this week as an analyst suggested Edward Lampert, Sears’ chairman and a big shareholder, may take the troubled department store chain private, buying out other shareholders. Mr Lampert had increased his personal stake in the company last week.Marathon Petroleum climbed 12.5 per cent to $37.17 over the five day period as activist investor Jana Partners disclosed a 5.5 per cent stake in the refiner and promised to push for reforms to increase shareholder value.
58;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2012-01-16T13:09:13Z;Half price Facebook ads – as long as you link back to Facebook;;Facebook is heavily incentivising its advertisers to keep users within the social network, rather than clicking out to their own sites, according to a new report by social marketing agency, TBG Digital.Advertisers using Facebook’s auction-based pricing system find, on average, that it is 45 per cent cheaper to buy ad formats such as Sponsored Stories, or encouraging users to click the Like button or install apps, than more traditional online ads which lead out into the open web. That price incentive is getting larger, TBG found, with a previous study in the second quarter showing that the cost-per-click (CPC) was 29 per cent lower than for ads leading to “offsite” destinations.TBG analysed 326bn ad impressions on Facebook during the fourth quarter of 2011, across 266 clients, who include Coca-Cola, Heineken, Dell and Capital One.For Facebook’s critics, this price incentive will be seen as further evidence that Mark Zuckerberg is trying to build a “walled garden” akin to AOL’s ill-fated scheme for a scaled-down, sanitised web in the 1990s.“It’s a pretty aggressive move to keep traffic within their site,” says Simon Mansell, TBG’s chief executive.But Mr Mansell believes ads that are (in Facebook parlance) “social by design” create a better experience for users, for which Facebook is rewarding advertisers through better pricing.“If brands invest money coming up with campaigns that are social by design, Facebook gives them some money back in lower advertising – that feels fair to me,” he says.That is reflected in some improvement to users’ click-through rates. Between the first quarter of 2011 and the fourth, click-through rates rose 18 per cent across the site globally. Because TBG only began these reports in the first quarter of last year, we don’t quite have the like-for-like data, but the agency believes that it suggests Facebook’s ads are becoming more engaging.Mr Mansell says that adoption of Sponsored Stories, which allow advertisers to take a user’s interaction with its brand (such as liking or commenting) and ensure that more of the user’s friends see it with a paid promotion, correlates with improving click-through rates. In France, where advertisers have more recently adopted Sponsored Stories, click-through rates doubled in the last quarter compared with the previous three months.But as with any new ad format to which users later become accustomed, that uplift may be short-lived. In the US, where Sponsored Stories are more established, click-through rates fell by 2 per cent, quarter by quarter.All eyes are on Facebook’s ad business ahead of this year’s much-anticipated $100bn stock-market flotation, which some rumours now suggest could come as soon as May.One proxy for Facebook’s overall financial health is whether the overall cost per thousand ad impressions shown (known as CPM in the trade) continues to grow, even as its global user base hurtles towards 1bn people. TBG’s study shows that CPMs grew by 8 per cent quarter-by-quarter, suggesting that growing demand from advertisers still outpaces the rising supply of users and pageviews to advertise against.“Overall it’s a good trend,” Mr Mansell says, although he adds: “There is such a massive level of expectation on them.”Another digital marketing report issued last week by Efficient Frontier, which has just been acquired by Adobe, found that Facebook now accounts for 2.7 per cent of “biddable” online advertising spend. Efficient Frontier predicts Facebook will reach 5 per cent of all online advertising spending by the end of 2012, with the bulk of that money coming from new sources rather than eating into existing ad budgets.That’s still a long way short of Google – but with such growth, it’s not hard to see why Google is risking upsetting users and regulators alike by thrusting Google+, its Facebook rival, to the top of its search results pages.
59;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

However, the process might not result in a sale, that person warned.BankUnited was bought by a group of investors, including Carlyle, Blackstone, Centerbridge and Wilbur Ross, in May 2009 in a rare sale of a failed US bank to private equity buyers by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Federal regulators were wary during the crisis of agreeing loss-sharing agreements on troubled assets as part of sales to investors who might then profit handsomely from a recovery in the sector.Under the stewardship of John Kanas, a renowned bank operator who in the 1990s rolled up a series of New York banks into North Fork, BankUnited has performed well, culminating in last year’s float. North Fork was acquired by Capital One in 2006.BankUnited shares jumped 5.75 per cent to $24.48 after Bloomberg reported that the bank was considering a sale.All parties declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.Banks such as PNC and TD Bank may look at BankUnited, suggested one sector expert, having shown an interest in the Florida market. PNC last year bought the US retail bank of Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45bn, enlarging its presence in the state.BankUnited’s backers stand to reap substantial rewards should they find a buyer for the lender, which had a market value of about $2.4bn after Friday’s share price move.Carlyle, Blackstone and Wilbur Ross still own just over 14 per cent of the bank each, according to public data, while Centerbridge has just over 11 per cent. The group of investors, which included Mr Kanas, originally invested $900m in BankUnited.Mr Kanas, who is credited with turning the bank around, would be paid $68.8m if BankUnited changes ownership, according to filings made last year.Dealmaking in the banking sector has been subdued since the crisis, as institutions struggle to understand and react to the barrage of new regulations since the financial crisis.Banks grappling to deal with the overhang of toxic real estate assets have largely fought through the worst of their problems, avoiding distressed sales. Few banks were keen to sell at a time when institutions were valued below book by the market.However, advisers argue that confidence has improved with valuations and they expect more banks to consider their future as a prolonged low interest rates make generating earnings growth challenging.

What we are seeing is FedEx and UPS pricing rationally to maintain earnings even if volumes are soft,” said Peter Nesvold at Jefferies.FedEx’s performance boosted shares in Amazon, which climbed 0.6 per cent to $181.26, but not Ebay, which fell 2.6 per cent to $29.60, on market chatter that December volumes on the auction site have been disappointing so far.Elsewhere, US stocks snapped three days of selling to eke out gains after new jobless claims fell to a three-year low.The S&P 500 climbed 0.3 per cent to 1,215.83, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,870.02.

62;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-11-09T19:20:49Z;Subprime loans come back to haunt HSBC;;For a bank that is keen to trumpet its global footprint at every opportunity, HSBC is struggling to shake-off one very parochial issue.Almost three years after it began to wind down its US consumer finance business, the bank is facing another severe bout of losses linked to subprime mortgages in the country.Loan impairments at its US consumer division more than doubled in the third quarter of the year to $1.8bn, compared with $880m in the previous three months.The bank’s latest problem is that large numbers of borrowers have simply stopped paying their mortgages.HSBC said some of its US customers had decided to skip their monthly repayment after a “foreclosure moratorium” made it difficult for the bank to repossess their home.Iain Mackay, finance director, spoke of the “moral hazard” involved in customers having little incentive to honour payments, knowing they would not be evicted by their lender.He said delinquencies in its portfolio of US mortgage loans had increased significantly in September, although there were signs of improvement last month.Stuart Gulliver, who took over as chief executive at the start of the year, had been making headway in running down the US consumer business. He sold its $30bn credit-card book to Capital One Financial and offloaded 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, a rival lender, for $1bn. Overall the US consumer loan portfolio shrunk from $61.3bn in the third quarter of 2010 to $51.5bn in the same period this year.But the mortgage losses threaten to derail HSBC’s efforts to halve this remaining book over the next five to six years.Moreover, the increased impairments have taken the shine off the group’s performance. They helped push underlying pre-tax profit down by more than a third in the three months to September, as growth in Asia was not strong enough to offset the US downturn.“The ghosts of the past are coming back to haunt them,” says Ronit Ghose, a banking analyst at Citigroup.HSBC is not suffering alone. Large US lenders including Bank of America and Citi reported more borrowers falling behind on their obligations during the third quarter. Others, including Wells Fargo, increased provisions for consumer banking losses.Nearly 6.4m US borrowers – 12.3 per cent of all homeowners with a mortgage – are late on their payments, according to data provider Lender Processing Services.To make matters worse, property values have slid nationally by almost a third from their 2006 peak. BofA, the largest home loan payment collector, recently told investors it expected prices to slide another 2.6 per cent by the end of 2012.Like HSBC, many large lenders face continued difficulties seizing the homes of delinquent borrowers.Mr Mackay said it was “almost impossible” for the bank to foreclose, even in cases where the borrower had not paid their loan for a year and it was clear they were “wholly unwilling and unable” to do so.The problem stems from revelations that banks allegedly broke state laws in using so-called “robo-signers” – employees who signed off on foreclosure filings en masse without reviewing the underlying paperwork.The ensuing uproar prompted various lenders to halt foreclosure activities last autumn. Several lenders, including HSBC, were sanctioned by US bank regulators, and are likely to be fined over their faulty mortgage practices.HSBC has been particularly hard hit, as it has yet to resume new foreclosure proceedings, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.“It will be a number of months before we resume all foreclosure activities in all states as we need to ensure we are satisfied that applicable enhanced processes have been implemented,” it says.HSBC has warned investors that the longer borrowers go without making payments, and the longer the time frame these homes are in foreclosure, the greater the losses it will incur.Mr Mackay says HSBC could not have wound down the US consumer business more aggressively, given that the majority of the loans have 30-year time frames and there are limited opportunities for customers in the portfolio to move their debt elsewhere.As Mr Gulliver continues to drive the bank deeper into emerging markets, the nagging US troubles are likely to cloud his progress in reshaping the global footprint of the bank for some time to come.
63;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-10-27T23:37:59Z;HSBC to sell Brazil consumer finance unit;;HSBC Holdings is seeking to sell its consumer finance unit in Brazil as the UK-based group looks to sharpen returns and cut costs, people familiar with the matter said.The group’s Losango unit is expected to be of interest to Brazil’s domestic commercial banks, which are dominated by Banco Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Itaú-Unibanco, and Banco Santander Brasil, the local unit of the Spanish bank. JPMorgan has been mandated to arrange the sale.Although no price was yet available for the deal, the company has 20m customers, said one person familiar with the matter in New York. It also controls about 20 per cent of one of Brazil’s most popular consumer loan segments.A surge in borrowing in recent years among Brazil’s emerging middle class has made it one of the most promising markets for financial institutions.But while lending has continued to grow at rates of about 20 per cent this year, delinquencies have risen in line with tighter interest rates.HSBC has been pruning its global portfolio as part of a drastic strategic overhaul unveiled by Stuart Gulliver, chief executive, in May.The bank in July said it would sell 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based lender, and the following month sold its $30bn US credit card book to Capital One.Mr Gulliver has been aggressive in forcing the pace of change at HSBC, unveiling tens of thousands of job cuts and pulling back from markets, including Russia and Poland.His goal is to cut costs by $3.5bn by 2013, making the bank more efficient and improving shareholder returns.In South America, the bank has this year already announced the sale of its Chilean retail operations to Banco Itaú Chile as it sharpens its focus on fast-growing markets and gets out of sub-scale businesses.But while HSBC is offloading the smaller Losango unit in Brazil, few expect it to pull out of the country altogether given the importance of Latin America’s largest economy as a growth engine.The group’s Brazil banking arm, HSBC Bank Brasil, contributed the most profits before taxes to HSBC globally after Hong Kong, China and the UK operations.News and comment from emerging economies, headed by Brazil, Russia, India and ChinaS&P said this month it viewed HSBC Bank Brasil as “a strategically important subsidiary of HSBC Holdings”.HSBC bought Losango in 2003 from UK-based Lloyds as part of a $815m acquisition of the bank’s total Brazilian assets.With more than 20m registered customers, Rio de Janeiro-based Losango offers private label credit cards and is also the market leader in so-called direct consumer credit (CDC) in Brazil with a near 20 per cent share, according to HSBC.CDC is a more traditional way for Brazilians to buy anything from package holidays to televisions on credit, whereby customers pay directly for the goods in instalments with pre-dated cheques or bank orders.An acquisition of Losango would also give a bank access to the group’s partnerships with 23,000 retail outlets in Brazil and a slice of the country’s hot market for consumer credit.
64;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-10-20T19:38:33Z;Cost-cutting US lenders beat forecasts;;Three of the leading US regional lenders reported third­-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ expectations as lower expenses and fewer loan delinquencies overcame decreased revenues to fuel higher profits.KeyCorp reported a 19 per cent year-on-year jump in net earnings to $212m. Fifth Third said its income more than doubled to $373m from last year’s $175m. BB&T said its net income rose 69 per cent to $371m, its best showing in three years.Separately, after the close of trading, Capital One, a leading credit-card lender that also owns retail banking operations, reported a 1.2 per cent year-on-year increase in profits to $813m, reflecting increased lending and lower funding costs.KeyCorp slashed its non-interest costs by 6 per cent to $692m compared with last year, while Fifth Third cut expenses by 3 per cent to $946m. BB&T reported slightly higher expenses, prompting Kelly King, chief executive, to announce a cost-cutting initiative during Thursday’s conference call with analysts. Mr King declined to provide a target but said it would be “substantial”.Regional banks are facing increasing pressure to cut expenses as a sluggish US economy depresses loan demand and rising compliance costs hit earnings. The restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal said this week that large US regional banks would need to reduce expenses by up to 40 per cent to cope with the worsening banking environmentFifth Third’s share price jumped 9.1 per cent to $11.63 and KeyCorp shares rose 6.9 per cent to $6.81, making them the top two performers in the KBW Bank Index. BB&T shares rose 1 per cent to $22.53.All three lenders reported fewer borrowers were falling behind in their payments. Severely delinquent loans at KeyCorp fell by nearly half from last year. BB&T said its bad-loan charge-offs were the lowest since 2007 and told analysts it expected delinquencies to continue to decrease in coming quarters.The lenders all reported lower revenues, as high unemployment in the US and deleveraging by consumers sapped loan demand.But one bright spot was the rise in commercial lending. BB&T said its loans to commercial and industrial customers rose nearly 7 per cent year on year to about $35bn. KeyCorp’s lending to commercial, financial and agricultural clients increased more than 8 per cent to about $18bn. Customers were also making use of a greater share of their credit lines, it said.Fifth Third said its business loans rose a more modest 1.7 per cent.The rise in commercial lending comes as many of the regionals’ rivals ramp up their loans to businesses, a sign clients may be getting more optimistic about the economy.
65;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-10-17T18:26:46Z;Big US banks hurt by struggling consumers;;Fears about the health of US consumer balance sheets grew on Monday as Citigroup and Wells Fargo joined JPMorgan Chase in reporting new signs that homeowners and credit-card borrowers are falling behind on their payments.The banks’ third-quarter results were hit by expected declines in investment banking, reflecting turbulence in global markets. But the reports also revealed weakness in the consumer side of their businesses – with mortgage delinquency numbers suggesting that record low mortgage rates and government loan modification programmes are failing to help a large swathe of homeowners.Overall revenues fell 8 per cent at Citigroup year-on-year and 6 per cent at Wells, sending their shares down 1.7 per cent and 8.4 per cent, respectively. The S&P 500 index fell 1.9 per cent.Wells said delinquencies of more than 90 days in its main portfolio of consumer loans – including mortgages and credit cards – rose 4 per cent to $1.5bn, the first increase since 2009. Early stage delinquencies in its retail business remained flat at 6.13 per cent after falling for three quarters. The bank increased its provision for consumer-banking losses for the first time in two years.“The economic recovery has been more sluggish and uneven than anyone anticipated,” said John Stumpf, Wells chief executive.Citi said the percentage of mortgages that were 90 days delinquent rose for the first time in almost two years – from 3.87 per cent in the second quarter to 3.88 per cent in the third. John Gerspach, chief financial officer, said the bank was seeing “re-defaults” on mortgages that had been modified to make them more affordable. “We could begin to see increased delinquencies and net credit losses,” he said.Citi cut bad loan reserves, but said that was due to improvement on credit cards rather than mortgages. “We haven’t been releasing reserves against the US residential mortgage portfolio,” said Mr Gerspach. “I would look at that as still being the most significant risk that any US bank currently faces.”JPMorgan last week increased its provision for losses on consumer loans to $2.3bn from $1.9bn in the previous quarter. JPMorgan said delinquencies on goverment-insured mortgages hit $9.5bn, up from $9.1bn in the second quarter and $9.2bn a year ago.“The residential mortgage problems are unprecedented,” said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital. “The rate of improvement in the delinquencies has slowed down dramatically in the last two years and even over the more recent quarters.” He said the problems were no longer in “subprime” but “prime” mortgages.Capital One, among the top six US card issuers, reported rising 30-day delinquencies in June and July. “Defaults on credit card debt are certain to rise from here,” said James Friedman at Susquehanna Capital Group.
66;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-09-15T21:36:13Z;S&P 500 tops 1,200;;The S&P 500 closed above 1,200 for the first time since September 1 as the rally stretched to four days.The benchmark closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,209.11, though bearish investors warned that it was unlikely to top 1,250 with fears about Eurozone debt still elevated.“There’s a limit to how far any rally can go without a resolution to the crisis in Europe,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Financials rose 2.6 per cent, with big bank stocks to the fore.Morgan Stanley was up 7.2 per cent to $16.59 after the company paid a regular dividend on news that Wall Street veteran John Mack will step down as Chairman. The bank also paid a regular dividend on its preferred stock.Goldman Sachs also rose 3.7 per cent to $107.97.Earlier, European banks stocks had soared after central banks committed to action to provide dollar liquidity.But Capital One Financial was down 0.2 per cent at $43.46 on fears that weak macroeconomic data had not filtered through to a reduction in spending by its credit card holders.New England bank People’s United Financial was flat at $12.43 as Goldman initiated coverage of north-eastern banks with a “sell” rating on the stock.Goldman said north-eastern banks were “as good as it gets” in the financial sector, given the low mortgage and default rate in the prosperous region, but worried that People’s United’s stock price implied optimistic capital deployment and value creation.Netflix fell 15.6 per cent to $176.20 after the online group cut its forecast for physical DVD subscribers, as a change in pricing structure took effect.The group projected that DVD-only subscribers would reach just 2.2m by the end of September, 25 per cent fewer than the forecast it made in July. It also lowered its forecast for streaming-only subscribers from 10m to 9.8m.The fall in projected customer growth pushed the stock beneath $200 for the first time since March.“Management have clearly underestimated the impact of the price hike for the combined service,” said James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities. But he said the stock price fall might be an overreaction, as “the vast majority of Netflix growth came from its streaming-only package”.Aircraft manufacturer Textron rose 4.1 per cent to $17.44 as investors continued to be impressed by the potential for earnings-per-share growth from a debt-juggling operation announced on Wednesday.Textron will issue debt to buy back outstanding convertible bonds. Credit Suisse calculations suggest the diluted share count will fall 12 per cent if Textron is able to retire all of the outstanding convertible bonds.That would raise earnings per share at the cost of a hit to earnings per share this year from higher interest payments on the newly issued debt.But Credit Suisse analyst Julian Mitchell said the group, which relies heavily on defence spending, was unlikely to deliver sales growth. “Our scenario work indicates that Textron has less than average upside in a low growth scenario, which investors seem to believe is the most probable, and higher than average downside in a bear scenario,” he told clients.The strong run in semiconductor shares, which has seen stocks such as Micron up as much as 15 per cent this week, ran out of pace just as JPMorgan urged investors to buy into the momentum.“Semis starting to – finally – break out. Time to gas up the minivan and climb on board,” JPMorgan analyst Christopher Danely wrote to clients, but the Philadelphia semiconductor index underperformed the S&P 500 on Thursday, and Micron dropped 2.2 per cent to $7.04.Life insurer Lincoln National Corporation, up 8.2 per cent at $19.78, rose more than any other stock in the S&P 500. But the stock is still underperforming peers, down 31 per cent in the quarter to date, compared with 23 per cent for the group, as its portfolio makes it sensitive to equity markets and low interest rates, according to Andrew Kligerman at UBS.Tenet Healthcare bounced 6.2 per cent to $4.77 but remains in the red for the week, after poor earnings results.Higher than expected inflation figures for August led to concerns the Fed might delay further easing. There were also signs weak macro data were working their way through to earnings expectations.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 4.7 per cent to 2,492.68.It was the first time that the Dow had swung 400 points in four consecutive sessions, and the first time the S&P 500 had swung 50 points more than four sessions, according to S&P Valuation Research.The banking sector led Thursday’s turnround, which erased the losses on Wednesday, with the KBW Banks index adding 6.1 per cent, and the S&P financial sector up 6.3 per cent.Bank of America, which has seen its share price halved since the beginning of the year, gained 7.1 per cent to $7.25 after a robust defence of the company by its chief executive, plus supportive analyst comments.Citigroup added 6.3 per cent to $30.29. Capital One, which rose even on Wednesday thanks to its announcement of adeal to acquire the US card business of HSBC, added another 7.5 per cent, to $44.14.The sector was boosted by the discussion across Europe of potential short selling bans on banking shares, which some traders believed might relieve some of the pressure on the continent’s banks.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said that the slowing economy and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to low interest rates could shave about 30 per cent off forecast bank earnings in 2012 and 2013.They said that Wells Fargo was among the banks best able to weather a decline in the economy. Wells Fargo’s price-to-book ratio, which fell below 1 on Wednesday, again rose above that level. The other largest banks, including Bank of America and Citi, are still below that level. Wells’ shares were up 6.2 per cent to $24.29.Investment banks were also stronger, after two initial public offerings priced on Wednesday night, suggesting some thawing of capital markets. Goldman Sachs added 7 per cent to $118.10, and Morgan Stanley was up 10.7 per cent to $18.21.A surprise decline in weekly US jobless claims, which fell to 395,000, their lowest weekly level since April, helped turn sentiment round. Though not a main economic indicator, it was welcomed by traders.“In an environment where investors are panicking, their expectations are very low, and this lower bar creates room for surprises,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Technology stocks gained 4.5 per cent just after the opening, thanks to Cisco Systems’ strong gains following an upbeat earnings report in which sales of equipment held up much better than expected. The shares jumped 16 per cent to $15.92.“The doomsday scenario did not unfold and Cisco managed to top expectations and deliver in-line guidance,” said analysts at BMO Capital Markets, who raised their full-year revenue and earnings forecasts.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, however, lowered their price target on the stock to $17 a share. “Fundamental risk remains high, particularly in the federal, Europe and service provider [segments],” they said, citing the end of government stimulus, the eurozone crisis and weak consumer confidence.Apple, the largest company by market capitalisation in the US, returned from 10 per cent “correction” territory reached on Wednesday. It was notable to investors who consider it among the US’s strongest companies. The shares rose 2.8 per cent to $373.70, now down just 7.6 per cent on the year.TrimTabs, the investment research firm, said that buying of shares by company insiders was at its highest daily average in August since June 2008, as company executives and owners snapped up discounted shares of their own companies.“This tells you insiders consider valuation is at least fair or cheap at the moment,” said Minyi Chen, vice president at TrimTabs.Closely watched News Corp shares jumped 18 per cent to $16.19 after reporting earnings of 35 cents a share, topping forecasts of 31 cents. Rupert Murdoch, chief executive, also said he would remain at the helm of the company, citing support from his board despite the ongoing scandal involving the company’s newspapers. The company also committed to further share buy-backs.Analysts at Nomura raised their price target from $19 to $20, citing higher profits and a higher multiple, describing the strong earnings as a “collective sigh of relief”.Materials groups that would benefit from rising commodity prices, which some believe could follow the Fed’s move to keep monetary policy ultra-loose until 2013, were also up. CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, added 10.1 per cent to $164.19, extending gains from Wednesday despite the market rout.
68;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-08-10T20:56:48Z;US stocks resume downturn;;US equities once again fell sharply on Wednesday, wiping out a late-Tuesday rally that many had hoped would represent a bottom to August’s steep declines.Financials continued to lead the move lower, dropping 7.1 per cent as a sector by the close. Citigroup fell 10.5 per cent to $28.49, and Bank of America fell 6.8 per cent to $6.77.The major indices ended the session at the day’s lows, with S&P 500 index falling 4.4 per cent to 1,120.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.6 per cent to 10,719.48, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 4.1 per cent to 2,381.05.The chief executive of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, sought to allay fears. On Wednesday he said the bank would seek to pay a dividend as soon as possible, and said it would not seek new equity capital.But the two largest US financial institutions, seen as highly sensitive to a US economic slowdown, only endured further volatility. Wednesday’s losses wiped out the brief rally in the shares on Tuesday, bringing them back near their lows seen after a 20 per cent correction on Monday.Leading financial declines on Wednesday were regional banks. Regions Financial fell 11.5 per cent to $4.23, and SunTrust slipped 11.5 per cent to $5.80. Wells Fargo, seen as one of the better-capitalised banks, still fell 7.7 per cent, to $22.88.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets recommended that investors should keep buying bank stocks. “It is important to remember that bank fundamentals are strong and we believe they are getting stronger,” they wrote.However, they also warned that regulatory uncertainty was weighing on the stocks. “The Federal Reserve needs to provide the [systemically important financial institution] buffers and a timetable to reach them,” they wrote.The troubles of large European banks weighed as well. France’s credit rating, much as the US’s was earlier this week, is feared to be vulnerable as European countries are all called to fund bail-outs to “peripheral” economies such as Greece.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said: “Despite the low valuations, we believe macro concerns will probably keep buyers on the sidelines in the near term”.There were gains in the sector, however, unlike in previous sessions. Capital One, the consumer lender and credit card group, agreed to acquire the US card businesses of HSBC for $30bn, which follows its earlier $9bn deal to buy ING’s US deposit unit. It is now among the five largest consumer depositaries in the US. The shares rose 0.7 per cent to $41.05.“This is a strong acquisition for Capital One and complements the ING acquisition,” said analysts at Citigroup.AvalonBay Communications, the property management group, was up 0.1 per cent to $125.67, after it was named as a possible buyer of rival Archstone, still owned by the bankrupt Lehman Brothers estate.The market had initially slipped to new lows on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold rates near zero until 2013, but did not extend any additional liquidity programmes.After the S&P 500 dropped to just above 1,100, many traders stepped in to close shorts, believing that the Fed’s promise of liquidity could be a catalyst for gains. But the market quickly resumed its initial move at Wednesday’s open.“The Fed did not commit to a third round [of quantitative easing] yesterday. Some traders seeking a bottom may have inferred they were likely to do so, but they didn’t do that,” said Clark Yingst, chief market strategist at Joseph Gunnar.Mr Yingst said that energy groups and other commodity-linked companies would benefit the most if investors believed “QE3” of some form was imminent. “Hard assets will be what people are seeking if there is ultimately going to be a round three of easing,” he said.ExxonMobil, the crude oil giant, was down 4.4 per cent at $68.03 on Wednesday, and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 3.3 per cent at $43.55.Materials groups CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, and Newmont Mining, the gold producer, were among the market’s most resilient performers, as the sector outperformed, down 3.3 per cent. CF’s shares were off by 0.3 per cent at $149.59 and Newmont added 0.7 per cent to $55.81.Retailer Macy’s succumbed to the sell-off, dropping 3.6 per cent to $24.52, despite the department store chain raising its full-year earnings forecast from $2.45 to as much as $2.65 a share.Polo Ralph Lauren, the apparel designer, added 4.5 per cent to $125.28 after it topped analyst expectations by earning $1.90 for the quarter, versus forecasts of $1.47.Walt Disney fell 9.1 per cent to $31.54 as the entertainment and media group missed forecasts for its revenues this quarter. Sales totalled $1.62bn, versus $1.83bn that had been forecast.Analysts at Nomura lowered their price target from $45 to $42 a share. “The stock is likely to be range-bound unless the macro outlook brightens or earnings begin to beat expectations again,” they said.
69;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-08-10T19:36:27Z;Man Group firm as volatility continues;;Directors’ share buying helped Man Group hold firm during another day of whipsaw volatility on the London market.Shares in the hedge fund manager climbed by 3.2 per cent to 187¼p after its chief executive, finance director and chief operating officer bought 50,000 shares each.Investors also took encouragement from a fifth straight weekly gain for Man’s key AHL fund. The trend-following fund has risen 7 per cent since early July, even as Man shares lost 28 per cent.“Despite some of the most volatile markets on record, AHL has managed to generate a strong 5.2 per cent return over the last two weeks,” said Goldman Sachs. “Although Man Group is unlikely to have escaped the recent market weakness altogether, we estimate that only 6 per cent of the firm’s management fee revenues are generated by the group’s $14bn of long-only equity funds.”Numis Securities was also positive on Man Group, based largely on the stock’s prospective dividend yield of nearly 8 per cent.While Man’s earnings slumped by 75 per cent during the credit crunch, its surplus capital this time round should cover the dividend even if management fees collapse, Numis said.The FTSE 100 dropped from a first-hour high of 5,262.75 to end at 5,007.16, down 3.1 per cent or 157.76 points. It was the sixth consecutive day that the index had swung violently during the session.Speculation about the strength of French banks served to undermine the financial sector.Prudential sank 7.4 per cent to 567p and Barclays, which was trading ex a 1p dividend, fell 8.7 per cent to 163¾p. HSBC lost 5.3 per cent to 516¼p even after selling its $30bn US credit card portfolio.Standard Chartered lost 7.5 per cent to £13.72. Hong Kong broker CLSA highlighted that, while HSBC was trading close to its trough valuation of 2008, Standard remained at a premium to credit crunch lows of around 50 per cent.Essar Energy dropped 12.6 per cent to 262p, taking its loss since flotation last May to 38 per cent. Goldman Sachs cut the stock off its “conviction buy” list based on growth concerns. It cited uncertainty over whether India would give regulatory approval to develop coal mines near its power plants, along with the group’s “rapidly increasing” net debt.Goldman was more positive on Burberry, adding the stock to its “conviction buy” list on valuation grounds. “The market underestimates the company’s revenue growth, margin accretion and returns improvement potential,” said the broker.In addition, Goldman expected more luxury sector consolidation and put a theoretical bid price of £19.77 on Burberry shares, which climbed by 3.3 per cent to £13.02.Standard Liferose 5.7 per cent to 184p after the insurer accompanied better than expected results with a hint of a cash return to shareholders. Analysts attributed the sharp reaction to the stock’s recent underperformance and its shareholder base, which is dominated by retail investors and tracker funds.Leading the mid-caps risers, Micro Focus was up 13.2 per cent to 283¾p. The legacy IT specialist said trading was better than management’s expectations and assured that it was still in talks to be bought.Telecityrose a further 3.5 per cent to 501½p as Evolution Securities repeated “buy” advice on the back of Monday’s results from the data warehouse group. “Earnings in the carrier neutral hosting market look as recession proof as the technology sector can offer,” Evolution said. We see scope for a re-rating in an environment where growth is going to be increasingly difficult to identify.”F&C Asset Managementedged up 3.1 per cent to 63p as Edward Bramson, the activist investor who took control of F&C in February, continued to add to his 20 per cent stake in the group.
70;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-08-10T18:39:44Z;HSBC: close but no cigar;The errors of judgment of earlier managers are steadily being fixed;If, in 2003, HSBC had stuck to what it is good at in high-growth emerging markets and not planted a flag among spendthrift emerging US consumers, it might have avoided years of trouble. There would have been no colossal crisis writedowns on its subprime lender Household, nor a $19bn rights issue, the world’s biggest. Now, under Stuart Gulliver’s more cautious management, the errors of judgment of earlier managers are steadily being fixed. That includes the great extrication from HSBC’s underperforming US consumer units. Last week came the $1bn sale of HSBC’s upstate New York branches to First Niagara. On Wednesday, he secured $33bn from Capital One Financial for HSBC’s $30bn US credit card book, the performing part of Household.Capital One, whose shares rose slightly in a terrible market, gains high-yielding assets at a good price. Conversely, a $2.4bn gain may not seem the best deal for HSBC: it will dilute earnings slightly in the short term. But stimulating an auction for a subprime card business in a heavily-consolidated industry was never going to be easy. At almost twice tangible book value, the price compares well with multiples of between 1.1 and 1.4 times paid, respectively, by Toronto-Dominion Bank for a similar Chrysler Financial book in April, and by GM in 2010 for an AmeriCredit portfolio. And the 8.75 per cent premium to receivables is not too shabby. The sale will add about 60 basis points to HSBC’s core tier one capital ratio of 10.8 per cent.Strategically, the card business was not core. HSBC should make more by recycling the proceeds from a low-growth US unit to fast-growing markets in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. But any re-rating remains a pipe dream. That will come only when it has fully reverted to its core, and compelling, business of trade and commercial banking in growth markets.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
71;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-08-10T05:20:56Z;HSBC agrees to sell $30bn credit card business;;HSBC has agreed to sell its $30bn credit card book to Capital One Financial, the Virginia-based lender, as it steps up efforts to reposition its troubled US retail operation.The business was part of the subprime lender Household, which HSBC acquired in 2003 only to write down huge losses on the assets as the financial crisis hit.Stuart Gulliver, who took over as chief executive of HSBC at the start of this year, says he is determined to make quick progress in cleaning up the US division.Ahead of the bank’s first-half results last week he announced the $1bn sale of 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based bank. The bank said on Wednesday it expects to make a pre-tax gain of $2.4bn from the sale.HSBC is keen to pare back its mass market consumer finance services in the US and focus instead on targeting wealthier customers through its “Premier” product range. The bank also wants to build up its commercial and investment banking businesses in the US, particularly where customers have strong international trade links.“This transaction continues the execution of the strategy we announced [in May] to focus our US business on the international needs of customers in Commercial Banking, Global Banking & Markets, Retail Banking and Wealth Management and onshore Global Private Banking,” Mr Gulliver said in a statement.For Capital One the purchase of HSBC’s card division would represent the second significant acquisition this year.In June it agreed a $9bn cash-and-stock deal to buy ING Direct USA, part of the Dutch bank’s online banking arm.At the time Capital One – which started out in 1988 as a standalone credit card issuer – signalled that it would seek opportunities to buy assets, having bolstered its deposit base by $82bn through the ING deal.Its aim, said people familiar with the matter, was to put ING Direct’s funds into higher-yielding assets, including credit cards.While ING’s US business had proved adept at deposit-gathering, the operations had been neglected since its Dutch parent hit trouble, these people said.Capital One has built up a 1,000-strong branch network, helped by the acquisitions of retail banks Hibernia and North Fork in 2005 and 2006, respectively.The ING Direct deal put the bank in fifth place in terms of domestic deposits, behind Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.HSBC’s credit card portfolio is profitable and has just over $30bn of balances.Overall the bank’s US retail banking and wealth management division made a $568m pre-tax loss in the first six months of this year, an improvement on the $1.57bn loss it posted a year earlier.HSBC’s shares closed up 1.3 per cent to 545p on Tuesday.
72;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-07-25T15:55:01Z;ING: disposal is not a bad deal;Dutch bancassurance group makes the best of a tough mandate;It’s no fun being a forced seller. But Dutch bancassurance group ING, obliged to sell its insurance, asset management and US online banking businesses to comply with European Union rules on state aid, is making the best of a tough mandate. Its latest disposal, the €2.7bn sale of most of its Latin American insurance operations to Colombian conglomerate Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana, is not a bad deal.Medellín-based GrupoSura will pay 1.8 times book value for a tidy earner (net income of €192m on revenue of €670m last year). For ING, that compares favourably with last month’s disposal of the ING Direct US business to Capital One – $9bn was barely book value, but part payment in shares provided some upside for its investors.ING’s proposal for deploying its €1bn of net proceeds may cause some dismay among investors, however. They had expected it to reduce some of its bank-and-insurance double leverage, put at €8.4bn by JPMorgan Cazenove, or even pay back the last €3bn from its €10bn state bail-out package. But ING thinks it can get more bang by cutting gearing in the insurance business, by about €2.8bn.That is not daft. With ING, Brussels and The Hague haggling over state-aid repayment terms – ING is supposed to pay a 50 per cent premium on redemptions, but wants an early repayment discount – it makes sense to put lipstick on its insurance pit bull. After all, ING still has to unload all its remaining insurance operations, with an equity value of perhaps €19bn – ample to wipe clean all of ING’s slates.Jan Hommen, chief executive, was dealt a lousy post-crisis hand. Selling even ING’s growth assets was always going to be tough. He is playing like a master, but ING trades at a 15 per cent discount to book, suggesting his investors want him to play the hand out. Hang in there Mr Hommen.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
73;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Energy and materials lead US stocks higher;;Energy and materials led US stocks to gains across the board as US equity indices ended a three-session slide.US stocks initially climbed as traders were cheered by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke discussing future policy options before Congress and saying that the US Federal Reserve was “ready to respond” if a further stimulus was needed to revamp the sluggish US economy. Yet they came off their session highs after a top Fed official opposed Mr Bernanke’s comments saying he was against providing a stimulus even if the economy worsens.Stocks lost further ground after John Boehner, house speaker, said there would be no guarantee that the debt limit would be raised if an agreement was not inked by early August.The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.31 per cent at 1,317.6 and the Nasdaq Composite was also in positive territory, up 0.54 per cent at 2,796.92.Most of the S&P sectors were up, with the materials sector 0.8 per cent higher with Titanium Metals at the helm, up 7 per cent at $18.9. The energy sector was up 0.7 per cent – spurred on in part by a decline in oil inventories, led by Alpha Natural, the coal producer, up 3.7 per cent at $45.The Dow Jones Industrial average climbed 0.4 per cent to 12,491.61, led by Caterpillar, which was up 1.6 per cent at $108.60.Financials weakened, but JPMorgan Chaseclosed 0.6 per cent up at $39.62, ending a three-session losing streak. However, poised for a lacklustre report of earnings before the bell on Thursday, it may say second-quarter revenue declined 0.8 per cent to $24.9bn according to average estimates by analysts.“The next big thing coming is JPMorgan releasing results, and that will fuel the fire,” said Sam Ginzburg, head of capital markets at First New York Securities.Investment Technology Group, an agency brokerage that serves large institutions, was down 13.73 per cent to $11.80, after the announcement of a large write-off for the second quarter alongside layoffs. As one of the lowest performing sectors, financials are under pressure to show that they can increase revenue within the sluggish US economy.Capital One slid 2.6 per cent to $50.87 despite reporting better than expected quarterly profits. It also said it would raise $2bn through a stock offering to finance the acquisition of ING’s US online bank.“Credit cards seem set for another quarter of beat and raise. Estimates are likely to move higher for Capital One. We continue to recommend Capital One and would note over the past year or so the card improvement cycle has survived several rounds of macro issues including the first round of Europe, the first GDP slowdown, and an oil price shock,” said Brian Foran, an analyst with Nomura.Other financial companies on the S&P 500 will announce earnings this week, including Citigroup on Friday.Marriott, the hotel chain, saw gains of 0.9 per cent at $37.10 while Yum! Brands, the US fast food restaurant group, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, closed up 1.09 per cent at $55.60. Yum reported a 10 per cent gain in profits or $0.65 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations. Marriott’s diluted earnings per share totalled $0.37, a 19 per cent increase over the same period last year. Both companies announced results after the closing bell on Wednesday.“Yum! Brands has cash flow, strong, predictable and sustainable earnings. It has global reach with 40 per cent of its profits coming from China, which contributed to great earnings over time,” said Tucker Brown, research principal with SGA.On the media front, Netflix, the DVD subscription and streaming video company, hit an all-time high of $304.80 in early trading, though it pared its gains to $298.70, up 2.6 per cent. The company signed a multi-year deal renewing and broadening its rights to films and television shows from NBC Universal. This Tuesday’s move to overhaul its pricing policy to reflect the relative costs of distributing movies via the net and the post, was imed at pushing users toward its growing streaming service.News Corp was still in focus after dropping its $12.5bn bid to take full control of BSkyB, though it said it would remain as a long-term shareholder. Also on Wednesday, Senator Jay Rockefeller called for an inquiry into the media group , the first indication that the phone-hacking scandal that sparked outrage in the UK could spill over to the US. Its shares closed up 3.8 per cent to $15.93 in New York, paring back some losses after experiencing a 12.1 per cent drop since last week.
74;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-07-12T20:49:25Z;US stocks fall after Ireland downgrade;;US stocks trimmed back some of their earlier gains before the closing bell when Moody’s downgraded Ireland’s rating.Shortly before the losses, they rose slightly as some policymakers at the US Federal Reserve seemed ready to ease policy if the economy stays weak.However, investors remained wary during most of the day after digesting earlier news that the US trade deficit jumped more than expected and as concerns over a potential spillover effect from the European debt crisis weighed on markets.The benchmark S&P 500 was in negative territory, falling 0.4 per cent to 1,313.6.“Rumours on the ECB and peripheral bonds were all around. There was a little bit of a short squeeze especially in the equity market”, says John Brady, senior vice-president of Global Interest Rate Products at MF Global.This is the first time since the US economy hit a “soft patch” in the spring that the Fed has raised the possibility of further monetary action, which would likely mean more quantitative easing, the policy of securities such as Treasury bonds in order to drive down long-term interest rates.So investors were focused on the Fed’s comments to gain clues into the Fed’s thinking of how the US economy is doing.“The markets reacted positively to the whole idea that the QE3 is a valuable policy alternative. Now it is a matter of political time in Washington to see if it is implemented and if, with the debt debate, the fiscal policy is going to turn more restrictive,” Mr Brady explains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average which hit its lowest level of the month in the previous session, managed to eke out gains to finish the session 0.5 per cent higher to 12,446.8.The Nasdaq Composite remained below the red line, down 0.8 per cent to 2,782. The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose above 3 per cent to almost 20.“After two days of double-digit decline, now some money is going into more defensive sectors,” said Ralph Fogel, partner and investment strategist for wealth management and advisory firm Fogel Neale Partners in New York.Among key S&P sectors industrials slid, while utilities saw some gains, closing at 0.5 per cent.After leading a slight recovery during the day financials retreated as the session drew to an end, closing 0.3 per cent lower, and extending a 2.8 per cent drop on Monday. Ahead of the key second-quarter earnings, JPMorgan Chase was down 0.1 per cent to $39.39 while Citigroup was down 1.6 per cent to $39.07.Mr Fogel added that even though “everybody hates bank stocks, the country cannot move forward without banks”.Eleven companies on the S&P 500, including Google, will announce earnings this week. In the financial sector, Capital One and Progressive are due to release reports on Thursday. Analysts estimate that companies included in the S&P 500 index will post average earnings growth of 13 per cent from a year earlier, the lowest increase in two years.On the technology front, Cisco Systems, the networking gear company, was up 1.1 per cent at $15.60 following news that it could eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs, almost 14 per cent of its workforce, to boost profit growth.However, Microchip Technology, the semiconductor maker, plunged 12 per cent at $33 dragging the sector down after the company cut its fiscal first-quarter guidance, results they attributed to challenges in its automotive business tied to the devastating Japan earthquake.News Corp was in the spotlight again. Its shares closed 0.12 per cent lower at $16.80 following news that Rupert Murdoch’s media group had started a $5bn stock repurchase scheme.The embattled company’s shares dropped more than 7 per cent in the previous session and have wiped out nearly $7bn in market value since July 5, with the UK phone-hacking scandal compromising its chances of a successful takeover of the 61 per cent of BSkyB that it does not own.The May US trade deficit grew 15 per cent to $50.2bn, exceeding forecasts by economists.According to commerce department figures released on Tuesday, this was the biggest change since October 2008.“This was really unexpected, all of the economists came nowhere close,” said Mr Fogel.
75;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-07-11T21:00:00Z;US stocks drop ahead of earnings;;US stocks dropped sharply, hitting their lowest level since mid-June as investors looked to the kick-off of the corporate earnings season for direction amid forecasts of slim profit growth.Stocks slid as investors worried that Europe’s debt crisis was spilling over into the larger economies of Italy and Spain.But shares traded off session lows after Barack Obama, US president, promised he would meet with Congress until the debt debate is over, after a fruitless weekend meeting where Democrats repeated the need for a “balanced” approach, while Republicans insisted that tax increases would further damage an already hurting economy.“People need to get a clear picture of the earnings and the big picture with the debt and the European issues still hanging”, says Myke Boyle, Senior Vice President of Asset Management at AAM.News Corpwas among the top losers, amid the continuing phone-hacking furore. The media group’s shares fell 7.1 per cent to $16.10 as its takeover of British satellite broadcaster BSkyB has come into doubt. The stock is down more than 12 per cent since last week and has turned negative for the year, as Rupert Murdoch’s media empire faces one of the biggest threats of its 20-year life.The benchmark S&P 500 was down 1.81 per cent at 1,319.49 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.03 per cent lower at 2,801.72. All key S&P sectors were lower, with five main groups down 2 per cent or more. Financials led declines down 2.3 per cent, including Bank of Americafalling 3.08 per cent to $10.37. Energy and materials followed financials, both lower by 2 per cent, including Chevronthat fell 1.41 per cent at $104.4.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped above 19. Yet despite the downturn, all major averages are still trading higher for July.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2 per cent to 12,501.98, with all 30 members in negative territory, led by Hewlett-Packard, down 3.2 per cent at $35.25. Ahead of upcoming earnings results this week, JPMorgan Chase was down 3.1 cent to $39.45, and Alcoa, the largest US aluminium producer, down 2.8 per cent to $15.93 following an almost 4 per cent drop on Friday.The Dow Jones Transportation average was down 2.1 per cent, and has dropped 3.3 per cent from its record closing high last week.NYSE Euronext shares fell 5 per cent to $34.44 as the the euro slipped sharply. NYSE Euronext investors voted last week to approve a merger with Deutsche Börse, whose own shareholders vote this week. The value of the all-share swap fluctuates with currency moves, since the Börse’s shares are denominated in euros.With much hope still riding on the second-quarter earnings season, Alcoa saw a jump in earnings, due partly to the high price of aluminum, becoming the first Dow member to release results after the closing bell.Analysts estimated that US companies will average 13 per cent earnings growth for the quarter, the lowest increase in two years.Eleven other companies on the S&P 500, including Google, will announce earnings this week.However, much of this week’s news will come from the financial sector, one of the market’s softest. JPMorgan Chase, Capital Oneand Progressive are due to release their reports on Thursday while Citigroup will do so on Friday.“Every time we get into earnings season there is always the feeling there will be a bad one. So some might now want to take a little bit of time take some money off the table”, adds Mr Boyle.The focus on earnings has grown, especially after highly disappointing employment numbers released on Friday crushed hopes that the “soft patch” in the US economy was coming to an end, reigniting fears of a slowdown.David Bianco, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said: “We continue to believe that the S&P 500 trades at a substantial discount to its fair intrinsic value owing to investors’ concern over tail risks.”But investors seem to be even more focused on this week’s expected reports on retail sales, jobless claims and inflation, as they attempt to gain a clear picture of the economy.“Thus, despite disappointing job gains in June, we believe the market’s near-term and full year performance will be primarily driven by either the eruption or fading of tail risks.”
76;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
77;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-05-24T21:32:45Z;US financials lose ground;;Shares in AutoZone jumped after the company reported better than expected quarterly earnings, but the wider markets were broadly flat as investors remained wary following the sharp sell-off in the previous session.Shares in the motor parts retailer were up 6 per cent to $293.30 after reporting a 12 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings as sales and margins improved.Analysts had worried that high petrol prices might hurt sales as consumers are driving less and therefore need to replace parts less frequently.Earlier in the month, Advance Auto Parts, a smaller rival to AutoZone, disappointed investors with its quarterly results. Auto Parts is down 5 per cent this month at $62.54.The S&P 500 index closed broadly flat, edging less than 0.1 per cent lower to 1,316.28.Most sectors were slightly lower – following the 1.2 per cent sell-off in the previous session – as sentiment continued to be downbeat over the eurozone debt crisis and global growth concerns.Financial stocks continued to lose ground. Shares in Capital Onewere down 2 per cent to $53.03 while the Bank of New York Mellonfell 1.2 per cent to $27.49. The S&P financial index lost 0.5 per cent.Healthcare stocks were also lower. United Health Group lost 2.4 per cent to $47.96 while Humana fell 1.6 per cent to $78.The S&P healthcare sector was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 7.3 per cent since the start of the second quarter as investors have recently been moving from cyclical stocks into more defensive areas.Sentiment across the markets was helped slightly by better than expected housing data. The number of new home sales rose 7.3 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000, ahead of the 300,000 expected.But this was still weak and so did not cheer investors too much.“The outcome was better than generally expected, although still miserable in absolute terms,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The losses in the wider markets were limited primarily by the rebound in energy and material stocks.In the energy sector, a bounce in the oil price helped Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climb 1.5 per cent to $83.28 while Halliburton rose 2.9 per cent to $47.50.The S&P energy index was up 1.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 3 per cent to $48.82 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 1.3 per cent to $48.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,356.36 in cautious trading. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,746.16.These larger indices have lost ground for the past three weeks as weak economic data have sparked concerns that interest rate rises globally are beginning to slow economic growth.“This has aggravated suspicions that the US economy may have entered a soft patch, not unlike in the spring of last year,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Last year the S&P fell 11.7 per cent from the start of April to the end of August on concerns over a double-dip recession.In corporate news, shares in Yandex, the Russian search engine, rocketed on its first day of trading.The Russian group was up as much at 144 per cent in early trading, although it settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its initial public offering price at $35.20. Yandex was priced on Monday night at $25 a share, valuing the company at $8bn.The jump in price was small compared with LinkedIn last Thursday, when shares in the business-focused social networking site jumped 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on their first day of trading.LinkedIn was up 8.1 per cent to $95.45 on Tuesday, in spite of restrictions having been lifted on short selling the stock, which pared all of the losses seen since the first day of trading on Thursday.Elsewhere, shares in El Paso Corp were up 6.5 per cent to $20.22, the best performing stock on the S&P 500, after the natural gas group announced it intended to separate its exploration and production unit from its pipeline and midstream businesses.Medtronicwas down 0.9 per cent to $40.88 after the medical devices company reported fourth-quarter earnings down 19 per cent on restructuring and other charges. Revenues were up slightly and better than expected, however.
78;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-04-21T21:52:04Z;M Stanley converts $7.8bn MUFG stake;;Morgan Stanley agreed to convert $7.8bn in preferred shares held by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial into common stock, eliminating a steep dividend payment that would have crimped future profits while leaving the Japanese bank with a 22 per cent stake.The accord came as Morgan Stanley reported a 45 per cent drop in first-quarter net income on losses from a securities venture with MUFG. The investment bank’s trading results exceeded expectations, lifting earnings per share above analysts’ estimates.Morgan Stanley had turned to MUFG in 2008 to help stave off collapse during the financial crisis, and the Japanese bank responded with a $9bn investment. In issuing preferred shares, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a 10 per cent dividend, at a cost of almost $800m a year.The preferreds would have converted to common shares had Morgan Stanley’s stock risen above $37.875 and stayed there for 20 out of 30 trading days. But scant enthusiasm for financial stocks and the economic and regulatory uncertainties that continue to cloud Morgan Stanley’s future have helped make the price target elusive.Morgan Stanley’s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $26.48.“We were encouraged by signs of progress in core results and we view the MUFG conversion, while dilutive, to remove a significant overhang to the story,” Howard Chen, an analyst with Credit Suisse, wrote in a note to clients.The stock has dropped 16 per cent in the past year and has not touched $37 since 2008.“What we have spent the last couple of years doing is clearing up a number of uncertainties that impact our future,” James Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. “And this was, frankly, number one on my list for this year. Obviously we had to pay a premium.”The bank will issue 75m new shares to MUFG in exchange for the early conversion and take a $2bn charge in the third quarter to account for the payment.Morgan Stanley had sought an agreement for months with MUFG to accelerate the conversion, arguing the high dividend had limited profits, and last month Mr Gorman again pressed his partners during a visit to Japan, people familiar with the matter said.While the heavy trading losses endured by the joint venture managed by MUFG took its toll on Morgan Stanley’s quarterly results, their timing helped build Mr Gorman’s case, the people said.Morgan Stanley’s net income fell to $968m, or 50 cents a share, from $1.78bn, or 99 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of 32 cents a share. The bank recorded a tax benefit of $447m, which added 30 cents to its earnings.Revenue fell 12 per cent to $7.6bn, driven by a $655m pre-tax loss from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. The bank owns 40 per cent of the venture, which is controlled by MUFG.The shortfall stemmed from losses in interest-rate swap trades. MUFG has agreed to inject more capital in the venture, replace its management and shift the lossmaking assets to a second joint venture that Morgan Stanley controls.“There was a significant trading loss in the business operated and risk-managed by MUFG,” Mr Gorman said on the call. “Because of the economic structure, we will bear 40 per cent of that loss, which drove a 26 cents per share impact this quarter.”Earnings from Morgan Stanley’s flagship institutional securities arm tumbled to $397m from $3.6bn on the losses from the MUFG venture. Revenue slumped 33 per cent to $3.6bn.The investment’s bank’s merger-advisory business reported an 18 per cent revenue increase, while underwriting fees jumped 11 per cent.Morgan Stanley’s equity trading desk had its best quarter since the crisis, as revenue climbed to $1.7bn from $1.4bn.While fixed income and commodities trading revenue fell $1.8bn from $2.7bn a year ago, the results marked a significant improvement from the fourth quarter, when the bank’s desks reported a loss of $29m.Mr Gorman credited Ken DeRegt, the former chief risk officer who returned to his old role in running fixed-income trading in January, for executing the turnround.“This is the first time I have felt comfortable with the leadership across all of our fixed-income businesses,” Gorman said.Income from Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management venture with Citigroup rose 25 per cent to $348m on higher commissions and asset-management revenues.The bank’s asset management division earned $127m, down 27 per cent from a year ago.On the call with analysts, Morgan Stanley finance chief Ruth Porat said the bank had appointed an executive to spearhead a companywide cost cutting initiative. The manager, Charles Chasin, is charged with finding $1bn in annual savings within three years.Morgan Stanley’s results followed a strong first-quarter numbers on Tuesday from Goldman Sachs, powered by strong revenues from its investing and lending divisions. Other US banks, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America, have been hit by their troubled mortgage businesses.Also on Thursday, Capital One reported a 60 per cent gain in first-quarter profit to $1bn, or $2.21 per share, from $636m, or $1.40 per share, last year as fewer borrowers defaulted on its credit cards.Meanwhile, PNC’s earnings rose 24 per cent to $832m, or $1.57 a share, from $671m, or 66 cents a share, despite a drop in revenue, as the bank set aside less money to cover credit losses.Additional reporting by Shannon Bond in New York
79;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-04-15T18:15:43Z;Earnings leave Wall Street stocks flat;;Disappointing results from Bank of America and Google weighed on the financial and technology sectors, but strong manufacturing and consumer sentiment data left the wider markets higher in the final session of a lacklustre week for US equities.Bank of America reported a 36 per cent decline in first-quarter profit as the foreclosures crisis continued to squeeze its home loan business.Earnings came in at $2bn, or $0.17 per share, falling short of the $0.26 per share expected by analysts.This left the stock down 2.3 per cent to $12.83, with news that the bank had made a deal with Assured Guaranty to resolve all its mortgage repurchase claims serving to limit further losses on the stock.Bank of America shares have fallen 33.9 per cent in the past year, the worst-performing stock in the 24-company BKX banking index, thanks partly to worries over its mortgage liabilities.The results weighed slightly on the financial sector, with Capital One losing 0.4 per cent to $50.03 and Regions Financial falling 1 per cent to $7.17. The BKX banking index was down 0.2 per cent.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Google dropped 8.3 per cent to $530.70 after the internet search group reported a 54 per cent jump in first-quarter operating costs.The news raised fears that Google was facing a deterioration in its underlying cost structure as it tried to maintain growth. The higher costs left profits below expectations, with pro forma earnings per share reaching $8.08, against the $8.13 analysts had forecast.These results dragged on the wider technology sector. Shares in Cognizant Technology Solutions were down 2.6 per cent to $78.72 while Yahoo lost 0.4 per cent to $16.62. The S&P technology index was down 0.4 per cent, the worst performing S&P sub-index.In spite of this, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,319.68 – down 0.6 per cent over the week – after the Empire State manufacturing survey showed that economic activity was expanding faster than expected in the New York area.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that its manufacturing index rose to 21.7 in April, ahead of the 17 point reading expected by economists. A figure greater than zero signals expansion.The Empire State index is the first of several regional manufacturing gauges to be released each month, although that from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve is seen as the most significant as a gauge of the strength of the wider economy.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index also came in slightly better than expected at 69.6. In other economic data, US prices rose 0.5 per cent in March according to the Labor Department. This was the ninth straight month of increases in the consumer price index, but it was in line with forecasts, and so did little to sway the markets.Overall, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 12,341.98 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,764.65. The indices have lost 0.3 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively in the past five days.The disappointing week on Wall Street began with sharp losses in energy and material stocks as commodity prices softened. This was partly due to Goldman Sachs advising clients to lock in profits on oil and other commodities.Lower than expected quarterly revenue from Alcoa, the first S&P company to report results, compounded negative sentiment in the material sector. Alcoa was down 7.8 per cent to $16.52 over the week while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 10.6 per cent to $51.17.The S&P material sector fell 2.3 per cent over the week while the energy sector lost 3.1 per cent.Towards the end of the week, financial stocks were in focus after the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations found that banks, including Goldman Sachs, had mis-sold mortgage-backed securities and misled investors and lawmakers. Shares in Goldman were down 3.6 per cent to $155.13 over the week while the S&P financial sector lost 2 per cent.JPMorgan Chase was down 4.2 per cent to $44.89, despite releasing quarterly results on Wednesday that beat forecasts.Arcos Dorados, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee, saw a strong opening week of trading, rising 25.5 per cent to $21.36. Zipcar, the web-based hourly car rental group, was similarly successful, trading at $27.16 – 52.6 per cent above where the IPO originally priced.
80;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2011-03-11T18:14:24Z;Credit card rates rise;Credit card interest rates continue to rise;"Credit card interest rates have continued to rise over the past two years, even though the Bank of England base rate has remained static.But borrowers with a clean credit history can enjoy longer 0 per cent balance transfer deals as providers compete to attract their custom.The overall average rate charged by credit cards is now 18.4 per cent, according to Defaqto, the financial research company. This represents a significant jump on the start of 2009 when average rates were 17.7 per cent. Over the same period, the Bank of England base rate has held steady at 0.5 per cent.Barclaycard currently offers one of the lowest representative APRs (which simply means the annual rate most people will be charged) at 7.9 per cent for its Platinum Simplicity card.Capital One has one of the highest at 34.9 per cent for its Classic credit card, aimed at those with a poor credit rating.Rates have risen as banks are less able to earn money by selling once-lucrative payment protection insurance – and have sought other revenue streams.However, many have also extended initial 0 per cent balance transfer deals and purchase rates in the hope of luring new customers. Nationwide now offers a 0 per cent balance transfer for 17 months and customers with a Tesco Bank Clubcard credit card pay 0 per cent on all purchases for the first 13 months.“The best deals are introductory ones,” says David Black at Defaqto. “The market doesn’t seem to be rewarding loyalty at the moment.”This week, the UK card issuers representative released figures showing that credit card usage

81;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-12-23T17:25:21Z;Moving from ‘Information’ to ‘Insights’;;The unprecedented volatility in today’s business environment has made it crucial that companies can quickly reconfigure strategic priorities. For most companies, this means re-evaluating the quality and effectiveness of their decision-making processes to ensure that decisions are informed by business insights.Chief Information Officers have a vital role to play here. Gartner, the IT analyst firm, recently put this into perspective, saying: “When organisations have to navigate a business transformation, the IT organisation is usually in the middle of it in some way, either as a key enabler or a key constraint. CIOs…need to prepare more vigorously to ensure that IT does its job to advance strategic change.”To do so successfully, CIOs must combine their love of technology with a broader awareness of strategic context. Specifically, this means moving IT’s focus from managing and securing data towards manipulating it to obtain insights that drive fact-based decision-making and competitive advantage. If they can do this, CIOs have an opportunity to emerge as ‘Chief Insight Officers’ – staking their claim to be significant business partners in their organisations.The good news is that CIOs will not be starting from scratch. Most larger companies have already invested in key technology infrastructure - data warehousing and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, for example. But at best, these capabilities are only equipped to process and store proprietary data. The next step must be to mash up this vital internal resource with targeted external data to deliver strategic insights in real time.The end goal for CIOs is to ensure that key decision-makers including the chief executive, are plugged into the targeted data and insights that will let them answer the question “What is the best that can happen?” If they can succeed in this objective, the benefits could be substantial.Take Sales & Operations Planning, for example. Vital strategic ‘bets’ for this core function are still being placed on the ‘HIPPO approach’ (the highest-paid person’s opinion) – with gut feeling the deciding factor in most instances. This could be transformed, provided CIOs can successfully embed predictive analytics capabilities into the fabric of re-engineered decision-making processes.Of course, the scale of the ‘data challenge’ should not be underestimated. In a 2009 Accenture survey of 600 UK and US blue-chip companies, two-thirds of respondents cited ‘getting their data in order’ as an immediate priority. And around 40 percent said that their current technological resources and systems significantly impeded the effective use of enterprise-wide analytics.Because of such deficiencies, these companies are finding it difficult to forecast market trends, pinpoint optimum purchasing options or nurture rising talent – just a few examples of areas where analytics ‘leaders’ such as Google, Capital One, and Tesco in the UK are realising powerful benefits.Commitment to analytics need not be the preserve of technology-driven giants. The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is using predictive analytics techniques to enable innovative decision-making. For example, backed by sophisticated audience analysis, the RSC was able to launch a much broader range of productions and audience experiences. The risk paid off, with a 20-plus per cent increase in ticket sales over previous Stratford-upon-Avon seasons.To ensure their organisations can realise such benefits, CIOs can and should be taking the initiative, first, by demonstrating to the business at large their commitment to fact-based decision-making, and second, embedding analytics into decision-making processes throughout the organisation.All companies have ‘got’ reporting. They routinely use descriptive, backward-looking analytics to handle that process. Having already invested in the hardware, software and talent they need to manage that core function, the challenge for CIOs is to connect these capabilities organisation-wide, while exploiting developments in predictive analytics technologies to enable what is, literally, ‘business thinking’.This means answering a host of tough questions. How should we reorganise our systems and processes? How can we acquire the right analytical talent to drive this new capability? What’s the most effective way of unlocking the insights within social networks?We know that winning companies – those that achieve a higher return on invested capital – exit recessionary periods as leaders and sustain their advantage over time. These are the organisations that exploit the opportunities at hand, using the cash-flow generated by cost-reduction programmes to reinvest in innovation and create their own upturn.As Chief Insight Officers, CIOs will play a vital role in galvanising and sustaining this process, helping to define the critical processes needed to deliver insights to key decision-makers and, as important, to define the data sources that will inform these insights.Dave Rich is Global Managing Director of Accenture Analytics
82;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-11-30T15:22:24Z;Teamwork and team dynamics;;This quarter, I am taking a core class in “managing people at work” and the discussions in this class spurred my to think about all the teams with whom I have worked, and perhaps more importantly, what I have taken away from each of these experiences. These teams include academic teams from my undergraduate days to corporate teams at Capital One and consultant and client teams at Bain. And finally, there are the multiple teams that I am currently working with at business school.To be completely candid, I used to have a slightly jaded view of teamwork and what I could learn from the experience while at school because I had had excellent previous experiences in teams (in terms of both learning and overall dynamics). My project team from my very last case at Bain was probably one of the best teams I had ever worked with – a “shoutout” to Kevin, Florian, Allan, Anni, Abiel, Katherine, Jacqueline and Stefano!However I have learned an incredible amount from working with my learning team in the past few months. What’s different about teams in business school? A lot! At work, the team is usually focused on one or two main activities/projects and everyone is usually well-aligned on what the priorities are.In business school, there is a heck of a lot more going on and tackling this is a learning experience in itself. Between recruiting events, personal commitments, club activities, different class schedules and varying degrees of need for academic performance, there is a lot of room for scheduling and conflicting priorities. Learning how to manage these conflicts and getting team projects done in a timely and highly quality fashion is a very valuable skill to take away from this experience.I believe that this is something that I can directly apply to work, not only to manage my own conflicts but also to help clients and supervisees address theirs.Other than learning how to manage a million things at once, there is also merit in learning how to create a high-performing team where there is no clear reporting or supervisory structure. Creating a high-performing team is often easier at work where there is some structure. Learning how to work with five other peers is not easy. It is often challenging to make important group decisions, to assign work, to establish group norms and to deliver performance feedback to name a few things. But learning how to do this effectively is yet another valuable asset for a business school student. These are lessons that can be applied at work, particularly when coaching peers or when supervising others in an informal or “dotted-line” relationship.Last but not least, one can also learn how to develop a support network in one’s team and learn how to ask for help. This may seem like a very simple thing but it is certainly something that I’ve seen others struggle with. At work, some people often hesitate about asking for help, for fear that it may reveal a weakness or lack of understanding of a particular topic. Others are hesitant to seek help because they don’t want to be a burden on others.Whatever the case might be, asking your business school learning team for help is a very easy and natural thing to do. Whenever I find myself struggling to understand a concept or if I’m completely at a loss when completing an assignment or even if I feel that I’m having a tough time managing my schedule, I feel completely comfortable and confident in turning to my learning team.This team structure and the supportive environment that is the norm at Wharton makes it easy for one to reach out to his or her team for help at any time. This culture of complete trust in one another has certainly made my learning team experience extremely positive and it is something I will try to cultivate in all my future teams.I’m sure there is a lot more that can be said about team dynamics in business school. Certainly, not all experiences are unique and there are some experiences that are definitely not very rosy. But I can surely say without hesitation that even those who have worked in teams all their lives can get a lot out of working with their learning team and cultivating a positive environment within their team.
83;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-10-15T20:53:05Z;US tech stocks climb on Google results;;A peek into Google’s YouTube and other new businesses sparked sharp gains for technology groups, the best performing sector on the week.In addition to reporting expectation-beating earnings, Google said in a one-time announcement that non-text display advertisements, such as those on YouTube and mobile phones, would generate $2.5bn in sales in 2010, which impressed analysts.JPMorgan Chase said YouTube represented about $1.5bn of those revenues. Credit Suisse said it estimated that YouTube was nearing profitability.“This colour should help improve sentiment around the sustainability of Google’s long-term growth,” said Spencer Wang, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Google’s shares rose 11.2 per cent to $601.45, their highest since January. It was the biggest one-day gain in two years.Akamai, maker of the video software that powers YouTube, gained 2.2 per cent to $47.09.Shares of networking equipment maker Cisco added 1.3 per cent to $23.36.Google also said paid clicks were up 16 per cent in the third quarter over the same period in 2009.Search and online ad rival Yahoo gained 2 per cent to $16.25 and Microsoft added 1.2 per cent to $25.54.Expectations also rose for Apple, which reports earnings on Monday. Its shares were up 4.1 per cent to $314.74, an all-time high.Gartner, the market research firm, estimated that the market for tablets such as Apple’s iPad could double next year.“A big fourth-quarter beat is expected …with innovation and future opportunities as strong as ever,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets.Private equity groups were said to be interested in a buy-out of Seagate, the data storage group.Its shares were marked up 22 per cent to $15.51 on the rumour that the offer by KKR and TPG would be $15 a share.

84;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-10-15T20:45:53Z;QE2 hopes diminish as risky assets fall;Treasury yields rise after Bernanke speech;Friday 21:30 BST. A burst of economic and monetary catalysts saw whipsaw trading throughout the day. But when the dust settled, risky assets were disappointed by Ben Bernanke’s speech in Boston, and the lift of “quantitative easing” for assets is straining to continue amid pressures on banks.The FTSE All-World index is down 0.6 per cent and oil and gold are falling back as the dollar moves higher.US Treasury yields were also rising, with the 30-year yield touching 4 per cent, as traders now price in what Mr Bernanke has deemed a desirable level of inflation, around 2 per cent.The Federal Reserve chairman said in a conference speech that high unemployment and low inflation in the US meant that there was a case for further action by the central bank – a strategy commonly referred to as QE2.“The Fed is effectively making the creation of inflation a policy,” said Christian Cooper, head of dollar derivatives at Jefferies. “No matter what kind of QE comes to the market in November, we are set up for a massive steepening of the yield curve.”But the fact Mr Bernanke did not reveal any details of the timing or size of QE2 – and in effect only confirmed what the market already knew – seems to have disappointed traders of short-term assets, whose view was slightly different from that of the longer-view bond market.US stocks and oil initially leapt, and the dollar fell, on Mr Bernanke’s speech, but they have all reversed as other drivers took over.“The stock markets seem to find it hard to believe Fed can generate inflation given the environment,” said Brian Larose, market strategist at United-ICAP. “As we approach the November meeting, traders will take their profits, buying back shorts in the dollar and taking off long positions in US equities.”Around the same time Mr Bernanke was speaking, the US consumer price index was reported to be slower than expected, rising just 0.1 per cent from August to September. Further data only underscored the consumers’ weakness: a strong September for retail sales did not improve sentiment, which is still at below-recession-average levels.Though the S&P gained 0.2 per cent, investors rushed out of banking shares, as worries about consumer credit – Capital One said charge-offs rose in September from August – and continued worries about mortgages weighed on the US sector, which fell 1.3 per cent in trading on Friday, as well as UK banking shares, which drove the FTSE 100 index lower than broader European indices.Forex. Currency trading was initially a bit more subdued than it has been of late, but burst into life when Mr Bernanke spoke. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, has gyrated as traders tried to get a grip on the various factors crossing the wires. It was up 0.4 per cent to 76.97, moving away from the 10-month low of 76.15 hit earlier in the session.The euro is down 0.8 per cent to $1.3973. The Australian dollar also fell back from near-parity, down 0.4 per cent to $0.9902.Japan’s finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, kept the possibility of intervention open, saying the government will take “decisive steps if necessary”. The yen has flattened out relative to the dollar at Y81.44, still near a 15-year high.The renminbi was at a fresh high versus the dollar as the US Treasury is due to release its semi-annual currency report that analyses the exchange rate policies of foreign countries. The renimbi’s 0.2 per cent gain to Rmb6.6397 means it has advanced 2 per cent against the dollar in the past 5 weeks.However, this may not be sufficient to stop the US charging Beijing as a “currency manipulator” given that the dollar index has dropped more than 7 per cent over the same period.Rates. US benchmark 10-year yields are up 5 basis points at 2.56 per cent, having risen 14 basis points over the past 6 sessions as worries about future inflation start to emerge and following a week of unimpressive auctions.Thirty-year US bonds were up 7 basis points to 3.987 per cent, after briefly touching 4 per cent for the first time since August. The spread between 10 and 30 year yields further widened, making it the steepest curve of any point during the financial crisis, and at least since the 1970s.However, two-year yields are down 1 basis point at 0.36 per cent, as the short end prices in the now sure-thing of the Federal Reserve buying US Treasuries.Commodities. Industrial metals were mixed as traders kept an eye on moves in the dollar – with which they have had a tight inverse correlation of late – and the economic data out of the US. Copper pared earlier gains, now up 0.6 per cent to $3.8 in Nymex trading.Oil is down 1.6 per cent at $81.41 a barrel, while gold is falling back from its record of $1,387.1 as the dollar finds its footing. The precious metal is currently down 0.6 per cent at $1,369 an ounce.Europe. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down, under pressure from resource stocks, but moved back to end the day at par after the US data. The FTSE 100 in London closed lower by 0.4 per cent as a relapse in the banks added to profit taking in miners.Asia-Pacific. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index was down 0.6 per cent after hitting a two-year high on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.9 per cent as the yen’s strength continued to weigh on exporters after the currency hit a fresh 15-year high of Y80.88 against the dollar on Thursday.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index lost 0.2 per cent as miners were mixed and financials fell. South Korea’s Kospi index has edged higher by 0.1 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.4 per cent.However, Shanghai has starkly bucked the regional trend, gaining 3.2 per cent as mainland banking stocks bounce on hopes they will deliver strong earnings. China’s benchmark index has gained more than 10 per cent in the last six sessions since returning from the week-long national holiday.Follow the market comments of Jamie Chisholm in London and Telis Demos in New York on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm and @telisdemos
85;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-10-05T17:16:39Z;Cheap bonds help fuel share buy-back rebound;Groups exploit attractive relative cost of debt to equity;"Are companies starting to turn the dial away from bondholders and towards shareholders?It is a question investors and analysts are increasingly asking as the cheapness of debt and relative costliness of equity gives companies big opportunities. Some groups such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are already exploiting what UBS is calling the most attractive relative cost of debt-to-equity in 30 years by issuing bonds in order to buy back shares.“We think we are at a tipping point in terms of corporate behaviour. Companies have been deleveraging and have got ample cash on their balance sheets: we believe we are at the start of the process where the focus will shift back to shareholders,” says Sunil Kapadia, global asset allocation strategist at UBS.With equities still an unfashionable asset class for most investors and companies hoarding record amounts of cash, investors are urging companies to take the matter into their own hands and take action to prop up their own valuations. “I can’t see investors changing their minds any time soon so in a way it has been left up to companies to step in and act as asset allocators,” says Robert Buckland, equity strategist at Citi.One side of the coin is the well-known cheapness of issuing bonds. Microsoft set a new record last month when it issued three-year debt with a coupon of just 0.875 per cent. On the flip side is the relatively high cost of equity. Comparing the free cash flow yield of stocks and shares against the yield for US Treasuries, Citi analysts found that the difference between the two has become positive in the past few years in both the US and Europe.That gives companies an enticing arbitrage opportunity between the cost of debt and equity. The question is: how many of them will take it on? Mr Buckland says: “If you can borrow money in the corporate bond market at 3 or 4 per cent and buy cash flow in equity markets at 7 per cent, then you have got a 3 or 4 per cent carry. Some companies are going to take this on.”Evidence is already building that many companies are prepared to do this as share buy-back activity starts to rebound after plummeting last year.Data from Birinyi Associates, a research group, shows that in the second quarter of this year executed buy-backs – those that actually happened compared with those that were merely announced – rose to $85bn in the US. That is back where buy-backs were in the middle of 2005, although this is still a long way off the peak of $228bn reached in the third quarter of 2007.Mark Bamford, head of global fixed-income syndicate at Barclays Capital, says: “We are seeing a number of companies exploring the idea of accessing the debt capital markets to retire more expensive equity capital.” Few are willing to make the connection explicitly but companies such as McDonald’s and HP have issued debt and made buy-back announcements close to each other recently.UBS calls this phenomenon “releveraging”. Mr Kapadia says: “Companies and investors should use the currency of cheap credit to unlock equity valuations. There is a huge incentive for companies to leverage again given this valuation gap.”Analysts at Citi see it as part of a broader trend, to which they give the particularly ugly name of “de-equitisation”. In essence, this looks at the total number of shares in issue and whether this number is rising or not. Rights issues or flotations cause shares in issue to rise whereas buy-backs and acquisitions cause this number to fall. Citi even argues that increased dividends should be seen as part of its “de-equitisation” trend as it is the preferred form of returning capital for many investors.BHP Billiton’s $39bn hostile bid for Potash is a good example of potential de-equitisation. If this deal were to proceed, BHP would issue no equity but would finance itself entirely through bank loans and bonds. Heath Jansen at Citi estimates that these current funding costs are less than 2 per cent and would rise only to 3-4 per cent as a bridge loan is replaced by long-term corporate bonds.Citi recommends looking at strong companies that face persistent takeover speculation such as Anadarko, or Capital One in the US, or ITV and Prudential in the UK; or groups that have consistent policies on buy-backs such as Akzo Nobel, BASF, Lockheed Martin or Texas Instruments; or businesses with a high dividend yield and a history of increasing it such as Deutsche Börse, Vivendi, Altria and Qwest.But while many see a clear trend towards deleveraging as – post the crisis – companies finally start to favour shareholders over bondholders, some bankers are sceptical. “It is very cynical to view providing balanced returns to shareholders as bad for bondholders,” says Larry Wieseneck, head of global finance at Barclays Capital. “Hoarding cash is not so good either: shareholders get very nervous, and bondholders should get even more nervous.”Perhaps the most intriguing part about de-equitisation is the suggestion from some that it could have helped J apanese companies as deflation took hold in the 1990s, with some arguing that it could have helped prop up share prices. With a persistent fear of deflation still in western countries, it gives companies more food for thought. “If there is one country in the world where the de-equitisation trade has made sense for 13-14 years it is Japan,” Mr Buckland says. “De-equitisation would have done a world of good to Japanese stock markets.”"
86;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-08-26T21:00:37Z;Surprise slowdown in US credit card losses;;"US credit-card losses are falling faster than expected, with the six largest card issuers expected to earn nearly $10bn more in the coming 12 months than predicted, says a study by Moody’s.Historically, US credit-card write-offs have tracked the unemployment rate. But for the first time in a decade, loans considered uncollectible by lenders are falling faster than the jobless rate, prompting analysts to revise earnings models.The divergence from past experience reflects bank efforts to weed out risky borrowers, moves by consumers to pare back debts after the excesses of the past decade and new credit card rules intended to discourage reckless lending.“We are getting back to an old-fashioned basis of lending, providing credit only to people who have the ability to repay,” said Curt Beaudouin, an analyst at Moody’s.The agency expects the six leading credit card issuers to earn nearly $10bn more in pre-tax profits in the 12 months from July than it forecast in March: $2.7bn for Citigroup; $2.6bn for JPMorgan Chase; $2.5bn for Bank of America; $931m for Capital One; $552m for American Express and $658m for Discover.However, the improving picture for banks highlights the macro-economic dilemma faced by US policymakers, because it points to continuing limits on consumer credit and a corresponding weakness in demand.“The tightening of lending standards by credit-card issuers in combination with a trend to deleverage by US consumers will have major ramifications going forward for economic growth,” Mr Beaudouin said.The Federal Reserve’s statistics on credit card loss rates show only two previous instances when they did not track the unemployment rate: the mid-1990s when issuers expanded into subprime debt, and a decade later when rules made it harder for borrowers to file for bankruptcy protection.During the 1991 and 2001 recessions, write-offs did not start falling until unemployment abated. However, Moody’s expects credit-card write-offs will fall from 9.3 per cent in July to 6 per cent in a year’s time. It expects unemployment to remain above 9 per cent during that period.“It’s a surprise,” said Beth Ann Bovino, a senior economist at Standard & Poor’s. “Those two readings tend to go hand in hand.”Credit-card loan balances at the six lenders have dropped 20 per cent since their peak in the second quarter of 2008, to $544bn, according to Credit Suisse. The six lenders reported combined pre-tax profits of $28bn in the 12 months ending in June, making the additional $10bn in anticipated pre-tax profits from credit cards significant. Citigroup was the only one to lose money, with a $6.8bn pre-tax loss."
87;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-08-18T14:15:09Z;Waiving and “placing”;;In one of my previous blogs, I briefly discussed how I was trying to balance waiving core courses and ensuring that I get a well-balanced business education. Lately I’ve been giving more thought to whether I should try to waive out of some core courses or alternatively, try to place into accelerated courses that cover the same material in half the time. I had come into business school with the mind-set that I was going to be open-minded about taking all kinds of classes and explore the different aspects of businesses but lately I have been swayed by the large cloud of my peers’ suggestions on the matter. A lot of people seem to be saying that class x is time consuming and not worth the effort or that class y is simply just a pain in the butt. So I’ve been left with trying to balance my original mind-set with the “advice” that I seem to be getting from A LOT of people.Now, one of the biggest aspects I need to consider is my previous lack of a formal business education. I was a Computer Science major during my undergrad years and though I took a handful of business courses, I doubt that these courses covered even a fraction of the material of an “equivalent” class at Wharton. This means that I am not really qualified to waive core courses or place into advanced courses by showing my academic credentials.On the other hand, I did receive phenomenal training in certain topics both at my ex-employer, Capital One, and my “current” employer, Bain & Company. At Capital One, I took a ton of structured training courses in statistics and regressions. And at Bain, the global and local training programmes covered accounting and finance to a great degree.So yes, I was very confused about whether to waive some courses or take the entire core as suggested.When pre-term started, I started out in the basic classes for most subjects but decided to take a shot at an “accelerated” finance class and the “waiver prep” statistics class for the reasons mentioned above. I still feel that I need a more solid foundation in accounting and economics so I’m going to stick with the core classes in those subjects. I feel that this gives me a good balance between opening up my schedule to take elective courses and at the same time rounding off my skill-set by taking most of the core courses.That’s all for now. The placement exam for finance is coming up this Friday and the waiver exam for statistics is next Tuesday so time to prep for those exams in between the tons of social activities going on.
88;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-07-23T18:47:17Z;Bankers overpaid by $1.6bn during crisis;;Citigroup, Bank of America and 15 other bailed-out financial services companies overpaid their top executives by $1.6bn during the height of the financial ­crisis, according to a review by the White House’s ­special master on Wall Street compensation.Kenneth Feinberg, who was appointed last year by Barack Obama, president, to oversee the pay policies at the companies that received the greatest government support, began in March his latest inquiry into top executives’ compensation from late 2008 to early 2009.While the payments were legal at the time, Mr Feinberg said on Friday, they would have fallen foul of restrictions the government set for participants in its troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).Citi topped the list on excessive pay, thanks in large part to the compensation of several star employees at the bank’s Phibro commodities trading unit, people familiar with the matter said. Citi sold the business to Occidental Petroleum last year.“Getting our compensation structure right is a priority for us,” a Citi spokeswoman said. “Since the crisis, we have done a lot of work to make sure it is performance-based and we look forward to reviewing the special master’s recommendations.”The other companies cited by the special master were: American Express, American International Group, Boston Private Financial Holdings, Capital One Financial, CIT Group, JPMorgan Chase. M&T Bank, Morgan Stanley, Regions Financial, SunTrust Banks, Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, PNC Financial Services Group, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo.While Mr Feinberg no longer had the authority to police compensation at those that had paid back the government’s investment, he used a “look back” provision in the statute to ask for more information about their pay during a window between the start of the Tarp and when new restrictions on executive pay took effect.Mr Feinberg reviewed what the 419 companies that received government assistance before February 2009 had paid their top 25 executives. The institutions were required to submit details on employees who earned more than $500,000.Eleven of the 17 companies cited by the special master have repaid the government for its assistance during the crisis. And, while Mr Feinberg conceded that none of the retention awards, bonuses, golden parachutes and other payments that appear excessive today was “contrary to the public interest”, he proposed the companies adopt a new policy that would supersede pay guarantees granted to executives.Mr Feinberg implored companies to give their boards’ compensation committees the right to restructure, reduce or cancel payments to executives during times of crisis.In October, he had moved to slash the 2009 cash compensation of the top executives at the seven companies within his jurisdiction by an average of 90 per cent from a year earlier.In December, Mr Feinberg took aim at a second tier of managers, setting a $500,000 salary limit for hundreds of employees at the companies that were still under his thumb. The White House last month appointed Mr Feinberg as administrator of BP’s fund to pay claims from the oil company’s devastating spill. He will leave his current post as “pay tsar” in August.

The main indices were all lower on the week, after two weeks of positive returns.“Investors are starting to take down their growth rate expectations for the next two to four quarters,” said Doug Cliggott, US equity strategist at Credit Suisse.“However, there are two positives for the market: valuations are pretty good and the balance sheets of the large caps are in great shape.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent to 1,076.59 but 3.5 per cent lower on the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.1 per cent to 10,143.81 and fell 2.7 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher to 2,223.48 but had erased 3.5 per cent since the start of the week.The measures agreed in Congress overnight on Thursday will regulate banks’ capacity to trade in derivatives but will not force them to sell their derivatives businesses, a measure some lawmakers had been pushing for.“While some of the measures may be stricter than some [observers] may have predicted, at least now the industry and markets can move from wondering what the reforms may be to learning how to live with them and move on,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.Financials, the session’s best performing sector, were higher across the board on Friday. JPMorgan rose 3.7 per cent to $39.44, Citigroup rallied 4.2 per cent to $3.94, Morgan Stanley added 3.1 per cent to $25.01, Bank of America advanced 2.7 per cent to $15.42 and Goldman Sachs jumped 3.5 per cent to $139.66.However, credit card companies underperformed the main indices as the financial reform bill limited the fee levels they can charge customers.MasterCard dropped 0.7 per cent to $213.30,Capital One Financial was down 0.2 per cent to $42.68 but Visa rose 0.2 per cent to $76.61.Oracle, the world’s second-largest software company, rallied 2 per cent to $22.66 on Friday. It reported a fourth-quarter profit of60 cents per share after the market closed on Thursday, topping the average analyst estimate of 54 cents per share. Demand for its programmes has grown as the economy recovers from the recession and it has been able to renew support contracts.Research in Motion, which makes the BlackBerry smartphone, dropped 10.8 per cent on Friday to $52.23 after posting worse-than-expected first-quarter revenues after the market closed on Thursday. Revenues in the quarter were $4.24bn, against the $4.35bn average analyst estimate, as competition between the BlackBerry and Apple’s iPhone intensified.KB Home was down 9 per cent to $11.12 on Friday, as the homebuilder specialising in homes for first-time buyers reported a second-quarter loss of 40 cents per share. Analysts had on average estimated a loss of 31 cents per share.Homebuilders were among the week’s worst performers following data released on Wednesday showing new home sales had fallen to the lowest level since records began in 1963.Pulte Group was 4.6 per cent lower at $8.92 and Toll Brothers declined 4.1 per cent to $17.20 but Beazer Homes inched up 1.7 per cent to $4.12.Lennar Corp was up 0.8 per cent to $14.68 after reporting slightly better than expected second-quarter results on Thursday.US-listed shares in BP were 15 per cent lower to $27.02 on the week as oil continued to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. On Wednesday, New York’s state pension fund said it planned to sue the oil company to recover losses due to the fall in BP’s share price. The fund said it owned more than 19m shares in BP when the oil spill begun in April.Anadarko Petroleum, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the damaged oil well, fell 11.9 per cent to $37.68 over the week.
90;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-05-19T20:51:27Z;Wall Street lower on Europe growth worries;;US stock markets reversed opening gains as traders sold shares tied to the global economy, ignoring the usually bullish signal of a stronger euro.“What’s interesting is that we’re still seeing the same risk-off trade,” said Jeremy Zirin, US equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management. “We’re shifting from structural concerns about the eurozone to worries about European growth rates and the global recovery.”After opening higher, the S&P 500 index was down 0.5 per cent to 1,115.05 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent to 10,444.37. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,298.37.Shares with significant European exposure were hit hard. Harman International, a maker of audio equipment, receives more than two-thirds of its revenues from Europe. Harman led S&P 500 decliners, falling 7.7 per cent to $31.73.Also weighing on sentiment was a weaker-than-expected consumer price index April report. Core inflation, excluding food and fuel costs, was just 0.9 per cent higher than this time last year – the smallest annual rise since 1966 – indicating a very mild uptick in economic activity.Industrial companies broadly declined. Caterpillar, maker of construction equipment, led the Dow decliners, losing 2.8 per cent to $61.44. Aerospace group Boeing fell 2.2 per cent to $66.21 and 3M, the diversified industrial, lost 1.1 per cent to $82.54.“Fundamentally, things are not changing yet but, since the market went up prior to the fundamentals improving, the market can also begin to discount a slight pullback prior to actually getting the data,” said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet, an agency brokerage.Losses were pared later in the afternoon once the S&P 500 neared 1,100, its 200-day moving average, but bounced higher soon after hitting it. “When sentiment is deteriorating, technical levels have outsized significance,” said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at Jefferies.Support also came from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting notes, in which policy makers raised their 2010 growth forecast and reiterated their dovish stance.Quarterly net income at Deere & Co, manufacturer of agricultural equipment, jumped from $472m to $547m year on year. Shares reversed and were up 3 per cent to $58.87.Financial stocks took a breather amid encouraging signs on regulatory reform. They were the only S&P 500 economic sector to rise, adding 0.2 per cent.Opponents were fighting an effort to bring the bill to an up-or-down vote, and a push to include a provision authorising states to regulate credit-card interest rates looked to have failed.Visa added 4.1 per cent to $72.97, and MasterCard was flat at $202.45. Shares are still down 15 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, since an amendment to regulate debit card fees was added to the bill on Friday.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at UBS, reiterated his “buy” ratings on Visa and MasterCard, saying markets were pricing in “unrealistic bear case regulatory scenarios”.Capital One Financial, the consumer credit card lender, added 2 per cent to $42.38. American Express added 0.8 per cent to $40.17.Leading banks were stronger, in spite of pressure from Germany’s decision to limit naked short selling, which led to a drop in shares of European banks. Citigroup added 2.1 per cent to $3.81 and Bank of America led Dow risers, up 2.3 per cent to $16.31.Peabody, the biggest US coal producer, fell 1.8 per cent to $38.49, and rival Massey lost 4.2 per cent to $31.35 as natural gas prices rose closer to $4.30 per million British thermal units.Target, the big-box retailer, reported that net income rose 30 per cent from the first quarter a year ago thanks to stronger apparel sales. European sales worries, however, led shares down 0.4 per cent to $54.03. Walmart dipped 1.2 per cent to $53.04.Hewlett-Packard added 0.5 per cent to $47.00, after first-quarter income beat consensus estimates.Healthcare was also a source of some support. Amgenadded 1.1 per cent to $55.26. JPMorgan reiterated its “outperform” rating on Gilead, citing the likelihood of approval for a key drug, boosting the shares by 1.9 per cent to $39.01.

92;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-04-21T15:59:35Z;Interest rate pricing on credit cards ‘confusing’;;Confusing new pricing mechanisms are making it hard for large numbers of consumers to prejudge what rate they will be offered when they take out a credit card, according to financial research company Defaqto.Many credit card providers now use ‘personal pricing’ where the interest rate charged is based on the individuals details, credit record and repayment history. For tose who are actually offered a credit card typically two thirds will get the best rate but up to one third will be offered a higher rate.David Black, banking specialist at Defaqto, said: “It always used to be fairly straightforward to get a credit card but providers have become increasingly choosy about who they will lend to and, if they will lend, at what rate. Many consumers don’t even get to that stage because the number of credit card applications being rejected has shot up.”Most credit card summary boxes only detail the typical APR but there are a number that also show the higher rates that may be offered. For example, Capital One gives a typical rate of 14.9 per cent but customers could end up with a rate of 24.9 per cent.Similarly, Egg advertises a rate of 16.9 per cent as a typical rate but could give someone up to 21.9 per cent. Then there is Vanquis Bank which typically charges 39.9 per cent interest on its Visa card, but could offer potential customers anything up to 59.9 per cent.Becky Paterson, a spokesperson for Capital One said: “We use personal pricing on some of our products. We do this to ensure that an applicant has the best chance of being accepted for a credit card rather than receiving a straight decline.“In cases where we use personal pricing, we make it clear to an applicant that there are two different interest rates available for the product for which they are applying - for example on our Plus card the interest rate will be either 14.9 per cent or 24.9 per cent depending on the applicant’s individual circumstances.”Ms Paterson, added that the interest rates they offer are based on an applicant’s risk profile. “Providing credit to people with a less robust or more limited credit history is considered a higher risk, which is why we offer a higher interest rate of 24.9% to some applicants in this category,” she said.
93;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-04-16T01:29:14Z;Credit card delinquencies ease;;Delinquency rates at major US credit card issuers declined in March in yet another sign that the economy is on the mend.Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial Services each reported a slight decline in the percentage of card payments that were at least 30 days late, a leading indicator of consumers’ financial health.The results echo comments made on Wednesday by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, and Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, about how the economy is showing signs of a rebound.“There are strong indications that not only the economy but the financial condition of individual households is starting to improve,” said Stephen Brobeck, the executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, a lobbying group. “Consumers are increasing their spending and yet at the same time reducing loan delinquencies.”Loan delinquencies tend to dip slightly in the spring as consumers use tax refunds to repay debt. But a strengthening economy is also giving people more confidence to spend. The government reported this week that retail sales in March jumped 1.6 per cent, more than analysts had expected and the largest monthly increase since November. Analysts warned that any recovery was still nascent and deeper problems persisted in the economy, including high unemployment and a weak housing market.Although the future is starting to look brighter for credit card issuers as delinquency rates fall, they are still grappling with record high losses on uncollectable loans. Bank of America and Discover both reported a decline in charge-offs but other issuers saw the measure climb month over month.At Bank of America, charge-offs fell to 12.54 per cent in March from 13.51 per cent in February. Delinquency rates dipped to 7.07 per cent from 7.23 per cent a month earlier. Discover said charge-offs dropped to 8.51 per cent in March from 9.11 per cent in February, and that delinquencies edged down to 5.39 per cent from 5.50 per cent.JPMorgan saw delinquencies drop to 4.51 per cent in March from 4.67 per cent in February but charge-offs rose to 9.51 per cent from 9.21 per cent in the same period. At Capital One, delinquencies fell to 5.30 per cent from 5.51 per cent and charge-offs rose to 10.87 per cent from 10.19 per cent.American Express also saw delinquencies fall, which bodes well for future business.

There was a loss of 64,000 construction jobs but manufacturing gained 1,000 jobs. About 48,000 temporary jobs were added.Despite the hiring of 15,000 temporary staff to work on the US census, government jobs fell by a net 18,000, due in part to the US Postal Service laying off 9,000 workers.The unemployment rate held steady at 9.7 per cent in February.“The unemployment report came in better than expectations, but there were no major surprises,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research. “It did not signify job growth except for manufacturing and private service providing.”The S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent higher at 1,138.70, rising 3 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent at 10,566.20 on the day, and 2.3 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 per cent to 2,326.35, up 3.8 per cent on the week.Takeover activity this week was led by the $35.5bn bid for AIG’s Asian life insurance business by the UK’s Prudential that would create Asia’s largest international insurer. AIG shares gained 13.8 per cent to $28.08 over the week.It was a strong week for acquisitions in the pharmaceutical sector. On Monday, Germany’s Merck bid $7.2bn for US-based healthcare products group Millipore, sending the latter’s shares up 11.2 per cent on the week to $105.17. Monday also saw Japan’s Astellas make an unsolicited $3.5bn cash offer for OSI, whose shares gained 53.8 per cent during the week to $56.99.Pfizer was rumoured to have made a $4bn approach for Germany’s generic drugmaker Ratiopharm. Its shares fell 0.5 per cent to $17.48.Citigroup gained 2.9 per cent to $3.50 over the week amid talk that the US government was set to sell a part of its 27 per cent stake in the bank.On Thursday Herbert Allison, assistant secretary of the Treasury for financial stability, said: “We wish to dispose of those shares in the public market as soon as circumstances permit.” He added that if the sale were to take place at the current price, taxpayers would make a profit.Apple shares rose 3.9 per cent on Friday to $218.95, an all-time high, after the company said its iPad tablet, a mobile device that falls between smartphones and notebook computers, would go on sale in the US on April 3.Retail sales in February positively surprised on Thursday, sending the sector higher. Over the week, Nordstrom rose 5.7 per cent to $39.01, Macy’s strengthened 6.8 per cent to $20.45 and JC Penney rose 9.2 per cent to $30.15.Small-caps continued to outperform the benchmark indices, with the Russell 2000 index rising 5.9 per cent to 666.02 over the week.RCN Corp, a broadband services provider, rose 23.6 per cent to $15.15 on Friday after it announced it would be bought by hedge fund ABRY Partners for $1.2bn including the assumption of debt.Marvell Technology gained 1.3 per cent to $20.40 on Friday after the maker of processors for BlackBerry devices posted a 64 per cent rise in revenues in the fourth quarter but still fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company said net profit was $205m in the quarter following a loss of $65m in the same period last year.Capital One Financial, an issuer of credit cards, was up 3 per cent to $37.94 on Friday. The stock was downgraded by Goldman Sachs to “neutral” from “buy”.
95;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-02-16T20:33:25Z;Credit card charge-off rates slow;;"Bank of America, Capital One and Discover reported better-than-expected charge-off and delinquency rates in January, fuelling hope that the worst of the credit bust may soon be behind the lenders.Bank of America said current charge-offs and loans at least 30 days overdue fell slightly in January. Discover and Capital One both reported increases – but the rise was less than some analysts had expected.“It [seems] delinquencies are stabilising,” said Bruce Harting, Barclays Capital analyst. He expects charge-offs and delinquencies to peak this quarter.Credit card issuers are also benefiting from an unusual phenomenon by which home owners, many of whom owe more on their mortgages than their properties are worth, are choosing to default on home loans to pay credit cards instead. It was formerly the other way round. According to credit bureau Trans-
Union 6.6 per cent of consumers were current on their credit cards but delinquent on mortgages in the third quarter of 2009, up from 4.3 per cent in 2008.US consumers are still cutting their credit use unprecedentedly. Outstanding credit card debt is about $855bn, down from $980bn in 2008. Analysts see it falling another $80bn this year.“Things are stabilising, [but] not improving materially,” said Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Even a sliver of good news was enough to boost shares of card issuers. At midday, Bank of America, Capital One and Discover were trading higher. Bank of America said loans at least 30 days past due fell to 7.35 per cent in January from 7.44 per cent in December. Uncollectible debt – known as charge-offs – declined to 13.25 per cent from 13.53 per cent the previous month.Capital One said 30-day delinquencies rose to 5.8 per cent from 5.78 per cent. Write-offs of uncollectible debt were up to 10.41 per cent from 10.14 per cent. Discover’s delinquency rate climbed to 5.55 per cent from 5.49 per cent. Write-offs dipped to 8.58 per cent from 8.68 per cent.It is unclear how much of the increase was seasonal. Charge-offs tend to rise early in the year as people struggle to pay down debt amassed during the holiday season. Bankruptcy rates increase as spring nears. Analysts said the worst of the bad-debt problem was probably behind the card companies."
96;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2010-02-05T02:01:39Z;Banks shut low-use credit cards;;Banks closed unprofitable or inactive credit card accounts at a record pace in the fourth quarter as the industry prepares for the introduction of new rules limiting the fees they can charge customers, a study has found.Eleven per cent of customers who took part in a survey commissioned by Credit.com, a financial advisory service, said their accounts had been closed as of January, up from 6 per cent in June. Credit.com also found that interest rates and fees continued their upward march through the end of the year.The moves have helped banks rein in ballooning losses. As of the third quarter, the most recent for which data is available, slightly more than one-third of the largest 24 credit card issuers tracked by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp were unprofitable, compared with more than half at the end of June.“Issuers are doing whatever they have to do to become profitable,” said Adam Levin, Credit.com’s founder. Banks have pushed through many of the fee and interest rate hikes ahead of changes to credit card rules that take effect this month. As of February 22, issuers will no longer be able to raise rates on existing balances unless the account is 60 days past due. Rules that went into effect in August require issuers to provide 45 days’ notice before they raise rates on future purchases.Despite the new rules, issuers continue to push through rate increases. A Capital One spokeswoman confirmed that the company recently notified customers of rate increases to future balances, but said all such changes were in compliance with the new rules.Card issuers are likely to continue to constrict credit as long as charge-offs remain at record levels. By the third quarter, charge-offs, a measure of uncollectible accounts, stood at 10.24 per cent, nearly double the rate a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve.In its earnings report on Thursday, MasterCard said that its bank customers had issued 966m cards as of year-end, a drop of 1.3 per cent over the same period in the previous year. Most of that decline was the result of US issuers purging accounts, the company said.“The worst in terms of credit reduction is behind us,” Robert Selander, chief executive, said, “but since we still have very high loss rates, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the US credit card industry show no growth this year.”
97;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-12-14T20:18:47Z;Obama presses banks to boost lending;;President Barack Obama on Monday delivered a stern message to “fat cat bankers” that, having been bailed out by the American taxpayer, they now have an “extraordinary” obligation to help spur the economic recovery and job growth.Voicing increasing frustration at the “disconnect” between the large profits and compensation packages at once-distressed banks and a nationwide unemployment rate of 10 per cent, the Obama administration urged the heads of the US’s biggest banks to increase lending to small businesses and mortgage refinancing.“The way I see it, having recovered with the help of the American government and the American taxpayers, our banks now have a greater obligation to the goal of a wider recovery, a more stable system, and more broadly shared prosperity,” Mr Obama said after meeting the chief executives of 12 institutions including American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Capital One, Bank of America and Wells Fargo at the White House.The chairmen of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup joined the president by telephone conference after the weather prevented them from flying to Washington.Both the president and the chief executives characterised the meeting as “candid” but Mr Obama signalled he wanted actions, not just words, in a CBS interview broadcast on the eve of the meeting, saying he “did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers”.With Wall Street returning to health while Main Street continues to struggle, kick-starting job growth and ensuring a more broad-based economic recovery has become Mr Obama’s top priority and thorniest challenge.“My main message in today's meeting was very simple: that America's banks received extraordinary assistance from American taxpayers to rebuild their industry – and now that they're back on their feet, we expect an extraordinary commitment from them to help rebuild our economy,” the president said.“That starts with finding ways to help creditworthy small and medium-size businesses get the loans that they need to open their doors, grow their operations, and create new jobs,” he said.In a sign of how swift their institutional recoveries have been, banks that borrowed from the troubled asset relief programme (Tarp) are paying back their funds early, partly to escape increased government restrictions. Bank of America repaid $45bn of government money last week and Citigroup was on Monday preparing to return $20bn.Banks are also preparing to award year-end bonuses, a move that will doubtless further increase popular resentment to the assistance that banks received.Some of chief executives said they had taken the criticisms on board, with Richard Davis, chief executive of US Bancorp, a large Minnesota-based regional bank, saying they were “aligned [with the president] on most issues and agreed that we can do a better job”.“We are looking for opportunities to make sure we don’t put people back in harm’s way or banks back in harm’s way,” Mr Davis said after the meeting, adding that opportunities for lending were greater at the end of a recession than the beginning.The bankers said they supported government efforts at financial sector reform but anticipating their rosy comments, Mr Obama said he did not want mixed messages.“The problem is there's a big gap between what I'm hearing here in the White House and the activities of lobbyists on behalf of these institutions or associations of which they're a member up on Capitol Hill,” he said. “I urged them to close that gap.”The House of Representatives on Friday passed a landmark financial regulation bill, which establishes a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency, a watchdog that has been fiercely opposed by banks.
98;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-12-13T19:15:26Z;Have you heard the one about...;;Does the secret to success in the corporate world lie on the stages of theatres and comedy clubs, rather than at the boardroom table? An increasing number of people in business education circles seem to think so.The likes of UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, MIT’s Sloan School of Management and Columbia Business School have offered business students teachings on improvisation and its application to the world of business.Each has chosen their own way of exploring improvisation. Columbia, among other offerings, takes students in their senior executives programme to a Harlem jazz club where seasoned musicians talk about how they work together, keep an open mind and choose their playing partners while improvising on stage.Academics say that elements of stage improvisation – know your audience, acknowledge [don’t ignore] negative feedback, think on your feet, be likeable and leave your audience wanting more – also have resonance in the corporate boardroom.Maziar Raz, a former corporate consultant, is focusing his PhD studies on the links between improvisational theatre and the business world, at the University of Western Ontario’s Ivey School of Business.“It’s about stepping outside the routines that have been bolted into our personalities,” he says.The potential benefits of improvisation outside the theatre have led academics to look at both theatre and jazz improvisation for models that help corporate organisations break free from traditional, structured thinking.And to some extent the global downturn has opened the world of business education to ideas and approaches that had been lingering on the sidelines when the reliable methods seemed to be working.“It really is a systemic response on our part to realise that what we had been doing 10 years ago, while maybe providing great technical training, was just not enough to prepare leaders and strategists for the problems they were solving,” comments Paul Ingram, a professor of business at Columbia and faculty director of the Columbia Senior Executive Program.In describing the benefits of improvisation, Prof Ingram likes to quote a jazz musician who says his job is “having a thinking body and a dancing mind”.Mary Crossan, director of the Leading Cross-Enterprise Research Centre at Ivey says some companies resist trying to build links between improvisation and business and see theatre sessions as useful team-building exercises, but not necessarily the facilitator of structural corporate change.“When organisations get into this they find it interesting, intriguing and fun. But to really engage …it takes some fundamental revisiting of what you do and how you do it,” she says.Prof Crossan works with the Second City comedy club in course offerings at Ivey. One of the challenges she finds is convincing companies that improvisation is not about being funny or entertaining. Rather, it is learning the tools needed on stage and applying them to the boardroom.Academics see their ideas taken up when businesses feel they are out of options, as many did during the worst of the recession. They must now convince companies that improvisational thinking can benefit a successful company just as much, if not more, than a struggling organisation. There is still the notion that improvisation is about flying by the seat of your pants rather than a set of skills that need to be fine-tuned for you to function at the peak of your intelligence,” says Bob Kulhan, chief executive of Business Improvisations, who, with Craig Fox, professor of policy at UCLA Anderson, established improvisation offerings at Fuqua.But, Mr Kulhan adds, “in the past year and a half the global meltdown has increased the need to find strong alternatives for education.”He has taught improvisation to managers from Proctor & Gamble, Pepsi and Capital One, as well as software companies and the military.The introduction of improvisation skills into corporate circles expanded in the 1990s. Now its proponents are studying its application in other fields, such as conflict resolution in legal circles, to see how to gain traction in the business world. “Improvisation is new in that it hasn’t realised its full potential,” Mr Raz says.Supporters of improvisation say there is no question whether it belongs in the mainstream, but rather how best to get it there.“It’s things that cut to the core of who you are and what you’re about,” Prof Crossen says.
99;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Bank firewalls cracked by cyberhackers;;For more than a decade the common currency among cybercriminals has been pilfered credit card numbers, but some underground hackers have learned how to drain money directly from corporate bank accounts.There has been a big rise in such frauds, raising the stakes in the war between financial institutions and criminals and costing some bank clients half a million dollars – or more.The cyberhackers “are clearly ahead of the defence in terms of antivirus solutions, firewall solutions, etc,” Jeffrey Troy, chief of the FBI’s cybercrime section, told the Financial Times. Online bank thefts in 2009 had seen “a very dramatic increase from past years”.Law enforcement warnings, recent reports from private security experts and lawsuits are focusing attention on the issue. Some professionals, citing the ongoing boom in virus infections through such social networks as Facebook and Twitter, fear the trends could combine in 2010.Mr Troy estimated that criminals took about $40m from bank accounts this year, primarily targeting the small and mid-sized businesses that are themselves customers of small and mid-sized banks.Such banks and their clients were less likely than their biggest competitors to have the highest-grade security procedures.Targets have fallen victim to “spear phishing” and other tricks. In spear phishing, a misleading e-mail, instant message or social networking communication is aimed at one company or even a single person within that company, frequently a top executive. The message can be tailored convincingly with details of interest to that individual.As with many generic phishing attacks that go to millions of users, the point is often to get the recipient to click on a link that installs software for surreptitiously logging keystrokes, so that passwords and account numbers can be recorded and transmitted over the internet to the hacker.Aiming at small groups means that security programs that look for copies of previously reported attacks are less likely to recognise the software.One of the most prevalent programs for stealing banking passwords, Zeus, can be bought and modified by anyone for about $700, Cisco Systems said in annual security study released this week.Through both phishing and silent installs via compromised websites, Zeus has landed on some 3.6m machines. Another virus, URLZone, can rewrite online banking statements so that pilfered money does not appear to be missing.Some businesses have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to thieves employing such tools. While banks typically indemnify consumers for online fraud losses that are spotted quickly, they can take a harder line against corporate clients. Such disputes are coming into the open with the first lawsuits over banking breaches.This month a Baton Rouge equipment seller called JM Test Systems sued US bank Capital One. The suit says JM Test noticed an unauthorised $45,640 wire transfer to a Moscow bank a day after it went through.Although the company complained immediately and Capital One pledged to investigate, it allegedly failed to freeze the account and a second fraudulent withdrawal of $51,556 went through six days later. The bank has refunded less than $8,000 of the losses, according to the suit, which accuses Capital One of having unreasonably lax procedures. The bank declined to comment, citing the litigation.Banks were modifying their systems, said Mr Troy, but they had problems with authenticating account holders.The same problem exists on the internet – and has been exacerbated with the trend toward shortened web links that deliberately compress – and disguise – the address of websites as they are passed along in e-mails or other messages.Many social media users placed such trust in material posted by friends and colleagues “that they don’t stop to consider the dangers of clicking on an unidentifiable link”, Cisco found.

Merrill Lynch raised American Express, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services from “underperform” to “neutral”. BofA-Merrill said economic recovery should improve credit trends and increase consumer demand. American Express rose 0.3 per cent to $39.41.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Citigroup lost 0.7 per cent to $4.03 after it emerged that the bank was locked in talks with the government over how much money it needs to raise to exit the troubled asset relief program.Last week, Bank of America sold $19.3bn in securities as part of a plan to repay $45bn of federal funds.Separately, Kuwait’s sovereign wealth fund, the Kuwait Investment Authority, sold its stake in Citigroup for $4.1bn, making about $1.1bn in profit.New York Community Bancorp jumped 8.7 per cent to $13.40 after the company said it would offer 60m shares to boost its capital levels following its purchase of certain assets and deposits of AmTrust Bank.On Friday, the group bought an $11bn chunk of AmTrust in a deal assisted by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.McDermott International added to the market’s gains after announcing plans to split into two publicly listed companies, separating its power generation business from its offshore oil and gas operations.Following the deal, expected to be completed in under a year, the group’s shareholders will own 100 per cent of the two different companies. The group’s shares jumped 10.7 per cent to $22.86.In the pharmaceutical sector, Eli Lilly won approval from US regulators to extend the use of Zyprexa, its anti-psychotic medicine, to teenagers with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The drugmaker’s shares were down 0.9 per cent to $37.07 after early gains.Amgen, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, lost 0.7 per cent to $56.48 after it said it would increase its share buy-back programme by $5bn. The group’s shares have fallen this year after safety concerns over its anaemia drugs led to sales declines.Sunpower, the country’s second-largest supplier of solar cells, climbed 9.6 per cent to $24.45 after Barclays Capital raised the group from “equal-weight/neutral” to “overweight/neutral”.Its shares plunged last month after the group said it was investigating millions of dollars in accounting errors at its Philippines operations.Terra Industries, the fertiliser producer, rose 5.7 per cent to $41.27 after CF Industries Holdings lifted its offer to buy its smaller rival to about $4.6bn.

It reported $5.89 earnings per share, beating average analyst forecasts of $5.42 per share, and shares rose in after-hours trading.Google shares closed down 1.01 per cent at $529.91 but rose to $541 in after-hours trading. IBM shares ended 0.29 per cent lower at $127.98 but fell to $123.25.IBM, closely watched for signs of spending on technology, also released results after the bell, reporting $2.40 per share. AMD also beat expectations, further showing growth is returning to technology companies.Though IBM’s results were slightly better than forecast, IBM’s shares fell in after-market trading, reflecting the growing trend that requires a big improvement from companies on expectations for shares to get a lift.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was in the spotlight after it breached the psychologically important 10,000 level on Wednesday for the first time in over a year.On Thursday, it traded below that level for much of the day after Goldman Sachsand Citigroup reported earnings. However, there was a late improvement after crude oil rallied on a drop in oil inventories.As a result, the energy sector made strong gains and pulled sentiment up across the board.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.47 per cent at 10,062.9. The S&P 500 was 0.42 per cent higher at 1,096.6, setting another 2009 high. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.05 per cent at 2,173.3.“After a week of mostly better-than-expected results and upside celebrations, today’s rather lacklustre performance could be a sign that the recent preponderance of good news has very simply raised the bar to what the market will reward,” said John Stoltzfus at Ticonderoga Securities.Goldman Sachs reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, but the results nevertheless dented sentiment as traders had whispered of even better numbers than the $5.25 earnings per share that the bank delivered.Goldman Sachs has been the strongest performer among the biggest US banks this year, with its shares notching up gains of nearly 125 per cent. On Thursday, Goldman shares closed 1.9 per cent lower at $188.63.Citigroup also reported earnings, making a third-quarter loss of 27 cents per share as credit losses continued to weigh on its results. Average forecasts from analysts were for a loss of 38 cents per share. Vikram Pandit, chief executive, said: “The US consumer credit environment remains challenging.”Citigroup shares, which are down 29 per cent on the year, fell 5 per cent to $4.75.The earnings from the two financial giants come after JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday injected renewed confidence into the sector as its biggest profit for more than two years helped push the Dow through the 10,000 barrier. Yesterday, JPMorgan’s shares held up better than some rivals and closed unchanged at $47.16. Among other financial losers amid concerns of consumer credit weakness was Capital One Financial whose shares fell 3.13 per cent to $38.12.It reported an increase in the number of customers behind on credit card payments in September.In technology, Nokia, the world’s biggest mobile phone maker, announced a surprise third-quarter loss due to a €908m ($1.35bn) writedown by its struggling networks joint venture.Shares in Motorola, the biggest US mobile phone group, fell 3.33 per cent to $8.13.The newspaper industry also took on a more glum tone, after McClatchy reported a 28 per cent drop in quarterly advertising revenue and forecast further declines through the end of the year. Its shares fell 12.94 per cent to $3.5.There was a more positive tone in the retail sector, after Safeway, the third-largest US grocery chain, released profits that beat expectations. Shares in the retailer were up 6.53 per cent at $22.83.
102;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
103;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-08-12T23:26:47Z;John Paulson bets on BofA with 2% stake;;John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made billions of dollars betting against subprime mortgages and shorting bank stocks during the past two years, has bought close to 2 per cent of Bank of America in what appears to be a strong endorsement of a bellwether financial institution.The price of BofA stock nearly doubled in the second quarter – when Mr Paulson purchased 168m shares – making the billionaire investor’s holding in the bank worth $2.2bn as of June 30, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday.Shares in BofA, which is the recipient of $45bn of government aid, closed on Wednesday at $15.93, up 8 cents. In after-hours trading – following the disclosure of Mr Paulson’s purchase – BofA shares were up 3.3 per cent at $16.46.A spokesman for Mr Paulson declined to comment on the BofA purchase, but the size of the stake makes Mr Paulson the fourth-largest shareholder in the North Carolina bank.Mr Paulson has also been accumulating shares of other financial stocks. In the second quarter, he bought 2m shares of Goldman Sachs and 7m shares of JPMorgan Chase, as well as 35m shares of Regions Financial, 17m shares of Capital One Financial, 12m of Marshall & Ilsley, 5m shares of Fifth Third, and smaller amounts of State Street and SunTrust. Mr Paulson was also part of the consortium of financiers who acquired IndyMac several months ago.One analyst, who did not want to be named, said Mr Paulson had probably acquired his stake while BofA stock was below $10 per share. “He liked it at $9, but does he like it at $16, or $40?” the analyst said.Mr Paulson’s newly found interest in financial stocks comes on the heels of a profitable short bet last year against the Royal Bank of Scotland, from which he is said to have made more than £300m ($495m).According to earlier regulatory filings, Mr Paulson made a series of bets on bank stocks in late 2008, buying 83.5m shares of Wachovia while it was under agreement to be bought by Wells Fargo, and 15m shares of Merrill Lynch, which had reached an agreement to be acquired by BofA.BofA had no comment on Mr Paulson’s investment.
104;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-07-26T17:30:27Z;How the cards are cut;;Mick Longfellow is teetering on the edge of financial chaos. A dedicated teacher married to an equally hard-working nurse, living in a modest house in Newcastle in the north-east of England, the pair spent the past decade treating themselves to gadgets, gizmos and home upgrades.They put in new windows. They bought the biggest television and sound system their living room could accommodate. They changed their cars every year or two. With two children to spoil as well, they were living on credit – lots of it. There were store cards, car loans, personal loans and credit cards.Now, amid the recession, those lenders want their money back. “The bank just closed down our overdraft. That was the killer blow,” says Mr Longfellow. But with the family’s debts running to £30,000 ($49,200, €34,600), far more than their annual disposable income, repayment is going to take a very long time.It is a sad blow for the Longfellows. But multiply one family’s debts by the millions of people across the world who are in an even worse state, losing jobs and homes, and the scale of the problem is clear. Estimates from the International Monetary Fund say that of US consumer debt totalling $1,914bn (£1,166bn, €1,346bn), 14 per cent will turn bad. For Europe, it expects 7 per cent of the $2,467bn of consumer debt will be lost, with much of that falling in the UK, the continent’s biggest nation of borrowers.In the US, the carnage is well under way. For nearly two years, banks ranging from giants such as Citigroup to small community lenders have been bleeding as the economic downturn caused “maxed out” consumers to fall behind on their repayments of credit cards, automotive loans, student loans and other once-plentiful forms of credit.In recent months, what started as a debacle has turned into a nightmare. As unemployment continued to rise and house prices kept falling, the rate of defaults has surpassed historic norms, rendering many of the computer models used by US banks to predict losses useless. In this phase of the crisis, lenders are flying blind.“We are asking boards of financial institutions to sit down, think about plausible nightmare scenarios and then take measures to deal with them,” says Peter Niculescu, a former executive at Fannie Mae, the US mortgage institution, who is now a partner at Capital Market Risk Advisors, a financial consultancy.America’s story makes a frightening read for banks on the other side of the Atlantic. The question now is what happens next in Europe, particularly in the UK, the continent’s biggest consumer lending market, where concrete signs of mass stress have so far been less obvious.“In the UK, particularly, we haven’t seen a lot of discussion about [consumer debt default],” says Nathan Powell, head of financial sector research at RiskMetrics, a credit data group. “There has been a focus on banks’ capital, liquidity and their mortgage exposure.”With much of the world in recession, the banking industry has been girding itself for some time against the threat – in recessions banks expect to make losses on loans. But some experts worry whether banks active in Europe, many of which have been rejuvenated by a quick bounce-back in their investment banking operations in the first half of the year, are yet taking sufficient account of the damage that their consumer loan books could yet wreak on profits.“Proponents of a V-shaped [economic] recovery are underestimating how much rising unemployment and an unstable structure of indebtedness can lengthen and deepen this recession,” says Sandy Chen, banks analyst at Panmure Gordon in London.Historic norms suggest that unsecured consumer loans default at a rate of less than 5 per cent in periods of recession. Although for credit cards the rate is higher, at 7 to 9 per cent, companies charge heftier interest rates to offset the increased risk of default.But this is no ordinary recession – and no one can agree how bad it is going to get. Some economists argue that the worst may already be over but many believe in a “double-dip” downturn, with another fall-off in demand likely to come later this year. Whether or not that happens, the effects of the first dip are still filtering through to the real world.Unemployment is still rising – and fast – on both sides of the Atlantic. More than 9 per cent of working-age Americans are now without work, nearly double the year-ago figure, and the UK unemployment tally is at 7.6 per cent. There are widespread expectations that both numbers could soon exceed 10 per cent – and joblessness, unsurprisingly, is the biggest driver of consumer loan default.The real unknown, however, is to what extent a recession already on a par with the 1930s will be turned into something even worse by record levels of consumer debt. British consumers’ leverage – how much they owe as a proportion of income – has been rising fast for a decade and for the past nine months has been running at a record high of more than 170 per cent – far bigger than anywhere else in Europe.In the US, the percentages have been rising too, and are hovering around the 140 per cent mark. In the last recession, of the early 1990s, UK leverage was barely more than 100 per cent and in the US it was less than 90 per cent. “The severity of this crisis has taken everyone by surprise,” says Mr Powell at RiskMetrics. “Delinquencies and charge-offs [the percentage of outstanding loans that is unlikely to be recouped] are deteriorating at a faster rate than anyone expected a year ago.”…Industry executives in Europe are beginning to sound like their US counterparts in raising the alarm about spiralling losses on unsecured consumer debt as one of their biggest areas of concern.“We think the market in general is far too optimistic about the outlook for unsecured consumer debt defaults,” says Antonio Horta-Osorio, chief executive of Abbey, the UK business of Spain’s Santander. “We have been actively reducing our exposure to consumer lending, so that it is now half the size it was three years ago.”The US experience is showing the way. “It started in subprime mortgages, then it moved to prime mortgages, then to car financing,” says Mark Greene, chief executive of Fico, the US credit checking group. “Now it’s moving to credit cards.”Over the past 18 months, US banks and card issuers have been coping with the fallout of millions of overleveraged consumers defaulting on an increasing portion of their unsecured debt. Loss rates on credit cards have almost tripled since January 2007 as soaring unemployment, housing woes and the stock market’s troubles prompted an ever-increasing number of borrowers to stop paying their balances.Perhaps more worryingly, the long-held relationship between credit card loss rates and unemployment is breaking down. Credit card loss rates have in the past closely tracked unemployment, topping the jobless rate on just a handful of occasions, and only once by any significant margin. That was in 2005 as a flood of borrowers entered bankruptcy and wrote off their credit card debt before the passage of a law that made it harder to file for bankruptcy.But in this recession, job redundancies have been compounded by other sources of distress to push credit card losses higher. Losses on US credit cards as measured by Moody’s credit card index were at a record of close to 10.8 per cent in June, ahead of the nation’s 9.5 per cent unemployment rate.As the recession has deepened, meanwhile, bankruptcy filings are once more approaching 2005 levels, fuelling the credit card meltdown.For some banks, losses on credit cards have been severe for months. Credit card loans originated by Washington Mutual, the troubled bank bought by JPMorgan Chase last September, are defaulting at a staggering rate of 24 per cent. Bank of America’s June charge-offs were close to 14 per cent and delinquencies – loans that have not been paid – were 1.9 per cent, exceeding the totals for Citigroup, JPMorgan, American Express, Capital One and Discover.If average charge-off rates reach 18 to 20 per cent, credit card losses for US issuers could exceed $82bn, the Federal Reserve said in May after stress tests on 19 large lenders.Such losses are proving to be a problem even in cases where the banks thought they had offlaid the risk. Banks such as Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have had to come to the rescue of the off-balance-sheet vehicles that help them to fund credit card loans, as these vehicles have been weakened by consumer defaults. In Britain, banks argue that they have been more prudent than peers elsewhere, owing to the scare of mass defaults four years ago after the law was changed to make personal bankruptcy via Individual Voluntary Arrangements far easier. That prompted the biggest lenders – Barclays, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS (now part of Lloyds) and HSBC – to toughen their criteria for lending: they lent less, and only to people with decent credit records.But what the banks do not point out is how many of them then let their standards slip at a crucial time. Just ahead of the financial crisis, in 2007, the big five banks (now the big four) started an aggressive expansion of their lending. Barclays is typical – after tempering its consumer lending in 2006, for example, it expanded it from less than £38bn to more than £53bn over the next two years. That kind of expansion at Lloyds and RBS has compounded those groups’ balance sheet woes.When the UK banks start reporting their six-monthly results early next month, they will give some idea of how bad those bad debts are turning out to be. They are already planning for default rates at the top end of historic levels.…One of the best insights into the likely patterns in consumer debt defaults comes from the niche world of credit card securitisations – where the performance data of a second-hand package of a bank’s credit card “receivables”, or credit repayments, are published monthly.The so-called Master Trusts of US credit card debt show default rates running at 9 to 18 per cent, up by 50 to 100 per cent over the past year, with most of the rise coming since the start of 2009. With UK trends tending to trail the US by six months, analysts are now watching closely for signs that British securitisations, with default rates running at a relatively stable 7 to 14 per cent, start rising.The focus on the securitisation data is a stark reminder, too, that it if this highly leveraged recession does lead to record levels of credit defaults, it will not just be the banks that suffer. Analysts estimate that in the UK close to one-third – and in the US about two-thirds – of consumer debt has historically been securitised. If those packages of debt turn bad – or even worse than they had already been reckoned to be – that would hit the investors that are holding them hard.Some of those investors will be investment banks – compounding the impact of the core lending losses to which their commercial banking rivals (or sister operations) are already exposed.In other cases, the pain will be even more broadly felt, says Huw van Steenis, analyst at Morgan Stanley. “I think the bigger holders now of securitisations are insurance companies and pension funds.” For families such as the Longfellows, with retirement looming in the next decade, that threatens to be the real sting in the tail.
105;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-07-24T20:36:39Z;Wall Street extends summer rally;;US stocks rallied towards the close on Friday to end a second straight week of gains on a surprisingly positive note after early falls triggered by disappointing earnings at Microsoft.The week saw stocks break various records, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 9,000 to set a new highest close for the year and the Nasdaq Composite index extended its longest winning streak since 1992.Technology stocks have led the recent rally, but the sector dropped on Friday as shares in Microsoft shed 8.3 per cent to $23.45.The reported much weaker revenues than analysts expected , with sales suffering an annual fall for the first time.Chris Liddle, the company’s chief financial officer, warned of continuing pressure on profit margins, but the rest of the sector shook off early losses to leave Microsoft as a relatively isolated faller.Broadcom, the microchip company, also lost ground, in spite of reporting better revenues than Wall Street expected, as investors worried about weak margins. The shares gave up 6.8 per cent to $27.20.But Broadcom’s rival Microchip Technology found modest gains, with the shares rising 0.6 per cent to $27.03 as the company forecast better estimates and sales than analysts currently expect.Defensive stocks gave further support to the markets as investors moved into less risky areas rather than selling out of equities altogether. Consumer staples, healthcare stocks and utilities all performed well.Drug makers were particularly strong, with Johnson & Johnson rising 2.1 per cent to $61.51, while Merck picked up 2.5 per cent to $30.99.“It’s a good sign that investors are rotating their money rather than pulling it out of stocks altogether,” said Keith Walter, a portfolio manager at Artrio Global Investors. “A lot of money is still in the sidelines, and people are chasing the rally right now, so we could see it continue.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.3 per cent at 979.26.The Dow advanced further above the 9,000 level, which it topped on Thursday for the first time since the beginning of the year, rising 0.3 per cent to 9,093.24.The tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered, however, declining 0.4 per cent to 1,965.96.All three were up between 3.9 and 4.3 per cent on the week, following a series of encouraging earnings announcements.This extended last week’s stellar gains as the majority of large companies beat profit expectations.There was optimism from the credit card sector on Friday, as both American Express and Capital One beat earnings expectations in spite of continuing worries about credit write-offs.AmEx saw uncollectible loans reach a record level, but its relatively strong earnings saw the shares close 0.2 per cent higher at $29.51.Its rival Capital One picked up 8.1 per cent to $30.07 as impressive revenues helped the company make a narrower loss than expected.Online retailer Amazon added to a gloomy morning, reporting disappointing revenues and falling 7.9 per cent to $86.49.The company’s shares took part in the broad market rally on Thursday, helped by the news that it would expand into the clothing sector by purchasing online shoe retailer Zappos.com.Elsewhere, Schlumberger, the energy company, beat expectations with both its profits and revenues, but warned that it did not expect any rebound in sales this year. Its shares fell 0.7 per cent to $57.34.“The disappointing results at Microsoft and Amazon highlight the market may be too optimistic about a sustained rally,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.But he added: “Going into month end, players are likely to buy dips.”
106;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-07-24T00:13:55Z;Amex stays upbeat in spite of earnings fall;;American Express, the credit card issuer, reported an 84 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings per share on Thursday but expressed increased optimism for the remainder of the year, based on improved trends by delinquent credit card and loan holders.Amex posted earnings of $337m, or 9 cents per share, compared with earnings of $653m, or 56 cents per share, in the second quarter of last year.Excluding the cost of a buy-back of preferred shares from the US Treasury, which amounted to 18 cents per share, the company earned 27 cents per share.Amex’s net write-off rate, which accounts for customers’ unpaid debts, came in at 10 per cent for the quarter, nearly double its rate from the same period last year and up from 8.5 per cent in the first quarter.In spite of those losses, the company was encouraged by recent trends.“Although it is still too early to point to any sure signs of an economic recovery, the number of card members who are falling behind in their payments, the volume of bankruptcy filings and the level of loan write-offs were better than we had expected,” said Kenneth Chenault, the company’s chairman and chief executive.Amex said its write-off rate would come in below 10 per cent for the second half of the year if those trends continued – suggesting that defaults may have peaked for Amex customers, who typically have higher credit profiles than customers of other card companies.“We believe it’s highly likely we will perform better than we previously forecasted,” Daniel Henry, the company’s chief financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts and investors.Capital One, which also reported results on Thursday, posted its third straight quarterly loss and said US card write-offs rose to 9.23 per cent.Wells Fargo said this week it expected credit losses to increase, while KeyCorp and US Bancorp both expected elevated write-offs for the remainder of this year.Spending by basic cardholders sank 15 per cent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago, while transaction activity fell just 3 per cent.But declines in spending by Amex card members moderated slightly in June compared with April and May.“Customers continue to pull their cards out of their wallet, so it’s really a story of lower spending per transaction,” Mr Henry said.The company’s results were roughly in line with analysts’ expectations, but Amex shares fell about 5 per cent in after-hours trading.Amex, which manages 88.5m issued credit cards globally, said it would use the benefits that come from lower-than-expected write-offs to expand its card portfolio.

Its shares picked up 4.2 per cent to $17.26.Other chipmakers also felt the benefit with AMD, Intel’s main rival, gaining 8.7 per cent to $3.86.Intel’s strong sales also provided optimism over personal computer sales and PC makers rose accordingly. Hewlett-Packard gained 4.5 per cent to $38.82.The rally gathered pace during the day and an upward revision in theFederal Reserve’s unemployment forecasts failed to knock it off course, as investors took confidence in a simultaneuos upgrade in the growth predictions.“The Intel numbers are enough to fuel the rally in the short term, but eventually the US unemployment rate is going to have an effect on the rest of the world,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 3 per cent up at 932.68, while the Dow rose 3.1 per cent to 8,616.21 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 3.5 per cent to 1,862.90.Anu Sharma, managing director of Nasdaq’s Market Intelligence Desk, described trading as a “short squeeze”, with short sellers having to buy back stocks in the worry that they might suffer heavy losses if the market rises further.There was also a warning sign on the stability of the current rally from the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility that usually drops when the market rises. It gained 3.4 per cent to 25.87 on Wednesday, suggesting investors were betting on an imminent drop.Materials stocks were also higher as the prices of metals picked up. Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper and gold, rose 5.7 per cent to $50.91. Its rival Newmont Mining gained 3.4 per cent to $40.45.Energy stocks were higher as the price of oil jumped. Chevron rose 2.5 per cent to $64.57 and Schlumberger climbed 5.3 per cent to $54.56. Investors also bought financial stocks, with banking shares continuing to bask in the afterglow of bumper profits from Goldman Sachs.But it was credit card companies that stood out after Capital One and Discover Financial both said loan losses in June had not been as bad as expected, in spite of the rising unemployment rate. Capital One jumped 11.8 per cent to $25.84 and Discover gained 6.2 per cent to $10.85.Shares in industrial companies also took part in the rally, helped by data showing industrial production had shrunk less than expected and factory output in the New York region had dropped by the smallest amount in over a year.General Electric rose 5.2 per cent to $12.24 and Caterpillar, which manufactures equipment for the industrial sector, put on 6 per cent to $33.84.The airline sector was boosted by AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, which reported a smaller-than-expected loss, which lifted the shares 4.3 per cent to $4.36.The general market optimism was tempered, however, by disappointing profits from Abbott Labs, one of the largest US drugmakers. The company also forecast full-year profits at the lower end of analysts’ expectations and the shares fell 2.6 per cent to $45.28.There were also worrying signs on consumer spending from Yum Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut and KFC fast-food franchises.It reported better earnings than expected but warned the rise in its same-store sales this year would disappoint. The stock lost 5.5 per cent to $34.05.Results from Gannett, which publishes USA Today, were more encouraging. It saw better-than-expected profit, powered by its online businesses. The shares soared 28.9 per cent to $4.50.
108;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-06-15T20:28:46Z;Commodity and consumer groups suffer steep falls on Wall Street;;US stocks dropped sharply on Monday as commodity prices weakened and investors worried about the pace of economic recovery.Commodity stocks surged during the first four sessions of last week, as the price of oil rose and the dollar dropped amid rising fears of inflation.However, they fell back on Friday and continued to give up those gains on Monday. ConocoPhillips lost 2.9 per cent to $43.10 while Schlumberger dropped 2.8 per cent to $58.59.Steelmakers, which were some of last week’s biggest beneficiaries, also dropped sharply. AK Steel gave up 8.1 per cent to $18.32 while US Steel declined 5.7 per cent to $37.10.Commodity producers were hampered by a strengthening dollar, which was boosted when the Russian finance minister said there was “no alternative” to the dollar as a reserve currency.Data showing that manufacturing in the New York area was falling much more than expected during June and that sentiment among homebuilders had dipped exacerbated the falls.These factors added to cautious words over the weekend from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, who warned that discussions about “exit strategies” from stimulus plans might be premature.Mr Strauss-Kahn said: “We haven’t exited the crisis yet.”Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: “Things are so weak we would expect them to continue to improve for quite a few months, but in some cases the improvement is petering out already, which is quite disappointing.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.4 per cent down at 923.72 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent to 8,612.13 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.3 per cent to 1,816.38 points.The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge spiked nearly 10 per cent back over the 30 level. Consumer stocks also suffered. Wal-Mart fell 2.8 per cent to $48.46, hurt by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which said sales growth at the retailer would begin to fall.Although Goldman said investors could move into more discretionary stocks as the recovery continues, others warned that the consumer sector would continue to suffer.“People are starting to realise that even when the economy recovers, certain sectors such as consumer spending are going to remain under pressure,” said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital. “This is a realisation stage for the markets.”There were negative signs on the amount of loan losses that financial companies still face. Capital One, the credit card lender, said the number of card defaults had risen in May compared with April. Its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $23.40.Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities, warned that Bank of America was experiencing “horrific” loan losses. BofA shares fell 2.8 per cent to $13.33. Also in the sector, shares in Lincoln National dropped after the company became the second large insurer, after Hartford Financial, to say it would take government bail-out money and raise further capital by issuing shares.The company said it would sell up to $900m of new stock, and its shares dropped 10.8 per cent to $15.83 on fears of dilution.Housebuilders were some of the day’s biggest fallers after the homebuilder confidence figures. Centex sank 3 per cent to $8.23 while KB Home, which also suffered a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, dropped 6 per cent to $13.24. There was further bad news for the airline industry after executives at European aircraft maker Airbus warned that output at its European factories could fall by as much as a quarter over the next two years.Shares in Airbus’s US rival Boeing fell 3.7 per cent to $49.52 but shares in other major airlines were worse affected, as research suggested business class flights on Delta Air Lines and American Airlines had halved in price.Delta lost 4.7 per cent to $6.10, while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, gave up 2.6 per cent to $4.43.

Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 4.4 per cent to $58.96 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, advanced 3.5 per cent to $11.15.Steel makers were also helped by rising metals prices, as well as analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded shares in US Steel and AK Steel but downgraded those of larger rival Nucor.Shares in US Steel rose 7.9 per cent to $37.82 and AK Steel jumped 9.8 per cent to $19.10. Nucor’s gains were limited to 2.1 per cent at $47.76.But the strength in materials stocks was countered by weakness from the consumer sector, where Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer company, warned that the short-term environment remained challenging. P&G’s shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $52.41.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent up at 942.43, close to its highest finish of the year, and the Nasdaq Composite index finished 1 per cent higher at 1,860.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction lower at 8,763.06.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford, said investors were looking at the dollar and commodities prices for signs of inflation to interpret the future direction of interest rates.“The market can only focus on one thing at once, and all week that has been whether interest rates will rise,” she said.Texas Instruments provided a boost for the technology sector after the microchip manufacturer said demand for its products would drive second-quarter sales and profits higher than previously forecast. The shares gained 6.3 per cent to $21.02.Bank of America added to the optimism in the sector when it said Microchip Technology‘s orders from China had improved, causing the bank to raise its price target on the company to $23. Microchip Technology’s shares picked up
6 per cent to $23.07.Other microchip manufacturers also benefited. Texas’s larger rival Intel advanced 3.1 per cent to $16.42 while Applied Materials gained 1.6 per cent to $11.03.News that the government will allow 10 of the country’s largest banks to repay a total of $68bn from the troubled asset relief programme failed to give the sector a lift, even though banks that repay the money will free themselves of some government involvement in matters such as hiring and executive pay.Several banks confirmed that they were on the list and some said they planned to repay the money soon. Morgan Stanley said it would repay its $10bn infusion in full but its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $30.98.Capital One, the credit card company, said it expected to repay its Tarp money “within weeks” and its shares rose 2.6 per cent to $24.05. American Express said it had also received approval, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $26.93.US Bancorp lost 0.9 per cent to $18.18 after it said it would also repay Tarp money but that the process of doing so would cost the bank $153m in second-quarter earnings.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said: “Financial stocks have been held back by the threat of inflation. We are seeing the negative effects of too much good economic news.”Some of the positive effect on financial stocks from the Tarp news was also damped by the congressional panel overseeing the Tarp process, which said the stress tests should be repeated on tougher terms.BlackRock continued its gains of the previous session as the company closed in on the purchase of Barclays Global Investors for a sum of $12bn-$13bn to create the world’s biggest money manager.The purchase would mean BlackRock has beaten off late competition for the unit from Bank of New York Mellon, and the company’s shares lifted 7.6 per cent to $182.14.BoNYM’s shares climbed 0.9 per cent to $28.79, as it confirmed it was also on the list of those allowed to repay Tarp funds."
110;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-05-21T23:24:59Z;Private equity consortium wins BankUnited auction;;A group including such major investors as Blackstone, Carlyle, Centerbridge and WLRoss won an auction for BankUnited on Thursday after the Florida lender – worth nearly $13bn by assets – was closed by federal regulators in the biggest US bank failure of 2009.The auction, conducted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was the second of a troubled US bank during the credit crisis. Earlier, a group including JC Flowers, hedge fund manager John Paulson and Dune Capital won the bidding for IndyMac’s assets.The BankUnited deal includes a loss-sharing agreement on $10.7bn of the bank’s $12.8bn in assets. The government will take 80 per cent of the first $4bn in losses and 95 per cent of any remaining losses, people familiar with the transaction said. In return, the federal government will receive warrants giving it a share of any future upside. The new investors, meanwhile, will put $900m of equity into the bank, bringing its tangible common equity up to 8 per cent of assets, and giving it the ability to make acquisitions.BankUnited, the largest independent bank in Florida, was dragged down by its large portfolio of adjustable-rate mortgages. It will be run by John Kanas, former chief executive of North Fork, a New York bank known for its aggressive deal-making, which was acquired by Capital One for $14.6bn in 2006.The winning group had been in talks with regulators for almost four months.When the talks were initiated, markets were at a low ebb, leading regulators to move slowly in the hope that sentiment would improve and more bids would be made.Toronto Dominion Bank and Goldman Sachs submitted a bid with a complicated structure that would have seen the Canadian bank taking over BankUnited’s branches and Goldman acquiring some assets. A spokesman for that group declined to comment.The transaction revealed on Thursday “is projected to maximize returns on covered assets by keeping them in the private sector”, the FDIC said.Regulators have worried that sales of troubled banks to private capital should not look overly generous. Those fear were fed when Chris Flowers, founder of private equity firm JC Flowers, said the investor group that bought IndyMac’s assets had all the upside for the failed California bank, while the government had all the downside. Calls to Mr Flowers were not returned.
111;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-05-12T00:09:48Z;Stress tests unleash fee bonanza;;The completion of US banking “stress tests” has unleashed a fee bonanza for Wall Street, with financial institutions set to earn more than $500m in just a few weeks for helping rivals raise equity to plug capital shortfalls and repay federal aid.Bankers expect a bumper period for equity fund-raisings as many of the 19 lenders involved in the tests tap the market to fill the capital holes uncovered by regulators or pay back funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp).The spike in underwriting fees, which touched a record low in the first quarter of 2009, will boost profits of banks’ securities units at a time when they have been hit by the slump in lucrative markets such as securitisations and mergers.Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Bank of America raised, or announced plans to raise, a total of nearly $30bn in the hours after Thursday’s release of the tests.On Monday they were joined by four other banks - US Bancorp, Capital One, BB&T, and KeyCorp, which plan to sell a combined $6.3bn in stock.The first three do not need additional capital but said they wanted funds to repay Tarp, while KeyCorp has to add $1.8bn in fresh equity by November following the stress tests.The stress tests already appear to be helping banks gain access to private capital, a key element in economic recovery, Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, said on Monday, according to Reuters. ”The initial indications are encouraging,” he said in a statement.Banks advising the lenders that have already announced capital-raising deals stand to share around $450m in underwriting fees, according to regulatory filings and people close to the situation.With a number of smaller banks expected to announce equity raisings in the coming weeks, the current quarter could become the biggest on record for underwriting fees from US banks.The most lucrative period for US banks advising rivals to raise funds was between April and June last year, according to Dealogic. At the time, more than 20 financial institutions paid out $845m in fees as they rushed to build a capital cushion against the worsening credit crunch.Some of the fees to be earned in coming weeks will be intra-company transfers as lenders with securities units such as BofA and Wells Fargo, have hired in-house bankers for the fund-raisings.However, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs - two of Wall Street’s traditional equity powerhouses - are set to gain large slice of the fees as they are underwriting several deals.The wave of new equity raisings pushed the US stock markets lower but bankers said investors showed a new-found appetite for financial companies.“The success of the capital raisings represents a positive catalyst in a sector and a market that hasn’t had many positive catalysts for quite a while,” said David Erickson, co-head of global equity capital markets at Barclays Capital, which was sole bookrunner on the Capital One deal.
112;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-05-11T20:29:46Z;Bank stocks a drag on Wall Street;;US stocks fell on Monday, giving back almost all the gains made on Friday in the wake of the government’s stress test results.Investors remained focused on financial stocks after three companies said they would issue shares to raise capital to pay off government bail-out funds.The results of last week’s stress tests had revealed that Capital One, BB&T and US Bancorp would not need new capital to survive the government’s adverse economic scenario. But the companies said on Monday that they would raise money to free themselves from government restrictions.Capital One said it would sell 56m common shares and its stock fell 13.5 per cent to $27.10. US Bancorp said it wanted $2.5bn from its issuance, sending its shares 9.9 per cent lower to $18.50.BB&T said it would use the additional $1.5bn it planned to raise also to boost tier one capital, an effort supported by a deep cut in its dividend. The company fell 7.6 per cent to $24.34.Other banking stocks also lost ground after last week’s impressive gains, even though reports over the weekend indicated the banks may need less capital than estimated if their earnings remain strong.Wells Fargo lost ground after it said it could fill its remaining $13.7bn deficit with earnings alone by November, having taken $7.5bn from a public offering on Friday. Its shares avoided the worst of the selling but slipped 5.9 per cent to $26.53.Even Morgan Stanley, which also successfully raised capital from a stock offering on Friday and which was upgraded by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday, lost ground. Its shares fell 7.6 per cent to $26.07, even though Bank of America said its shares would do well on “long-term earnings power”.Prudential, the life assurer, was a particularly heavy faller after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral”, slashing its price target. Goldman upgraded the company just over two weeks ago, triggering a 10.8 per cent rise in its shares. They lost 12.3 per cent to $40.33 on Monday.Principal Financial, Prudential’s rival, also slumped after saying it would offer 42.3m shares, valued at over $1bn, in order to bolster its capital position. The shares lost 14.1 per cent to $20.34.Huntington Bancshares was one of the few financial companies to find gains as Bank of America said the company would start posting a profit in 2011. Its shares jumped 9.8 per cent to $5.71.The S&P 500 fell 2.2 per cent to 909.24, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8 per cent to 8,418.77.“If the S&P can get through the first half of this week without breaking through 900 it will be a win for the bulls,” said David Kreinces, portfolio manager at ETF PM.The Nasdaq Composite index fell a relatively modest 0.5 per cent to 1,731.24, however, amid resilience from technology stocks.Microsoft lost 0.5 per cent to $19.32 after the company said it would sell debt in order to take advantage of its rare triple-A credit rating. It has resisted taking on debt for years.“The fact that Microsoft is issuing debt suggests they must think the environment is pretty good and rates are going to be going up because the economy will improve,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors.Intel rallied ahead of the European Union’s decision on whether to approve action against the company on allegations that it abused its dominant market position. Lawyers forecast that any potential fine could be one of the heaviest implemented in Europe but the stock edged 0.5 per cent higher to $15.37.Energy producers lost ground as the price of oil fell following its recent rally, during which it reached new highs for the year. Chevron lost 3.4 per cent to $68 and ExxonMobil dropped 1.6 per cent to $69.27.CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company, was one of the S&P’s biggest fallers after the company was downgraded by Goldman Sachs to “sell”. Its shares dropped 10.6 per cent to $8.38.General Motors was another heavy faller as Fritz Henderson, chief executive, said it was “more probable” that the company would file for bankruptcy by June 1 in his latest update on the car company’s restructuring efforts. Its stock gave up 10.6 per cent to $1.44.
113;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-05-11T15:30:23Z;Wall Street set to open lower;;US stocks opened lower on Monday, giving back some of the gains made during last week, which took the benchmark S&P 500 close to its high for the year.Investors remained focused on financial stocks after three companies said they would look to raise capital in order to pay off government bailout funds.The results of last week’s stress tests had revealed that Capital One, BB&T and US Bancorp would not need new capital to survive the government’s adverse economic scenario. But the companies announced on Monday they would offer $1.5bn or more in stock to free themselves from government restrictions.All three fell in early trade on the prospect of unexpected shareholder dilution. Capital One gave up 9.4 per cent to $28.39, while BB&T lost 4.3 per cent to $25.19 and US Bancorp dropped 4.2 per cent to $19.68.Other banking stocks also lost ground after last week’s impressive gains, even though reports over the weekend showed the banks may need even less capital than announced by the government if their earnings remain strong.Wells Fargo said it could fill its remaining $13.7bn deficit by earnings alone by November, having taken $7.5bn from a public offering on Friday, which was more than expected. But its shares fell amid the wider profit-taking, losing 2.6 per cent to $27.45.Even Morgan Stanley, which also successfully raised capital from a stock offering on Friday, and which was upgraded by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday, lost ground. Its shares fell 4.6 per cent to $26.91 even as Bank of America said the company’s shares would do well on “long-term earnings power”.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported its worst quarterly loss in at least two decades as the company looked to regain losses after buying shares in energy producer ConocoPhillips shortly before the price of oil crashed. Its shares lost 2.1 per cent to $93,300.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8 per cent to 912.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.4 per cent to 8,451.35 points. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 1 per cent to 1,721.08 points.“The rally in the financials is stretched, but players are gaining exposure believing the banks are solvent and capital needs will be met. We believe the market is ahead of itself,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global Research.CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company, was the S&P’s biggest faller in early trade after the company was downgraded by Goldman Sachs to “sell”. Its shares slumped 12.1 per cent to $8.24.General Motors was another heavy faller after Swedish news agency TT said the company was currently considering two bidders for its Saab unit. This followed reports last week from Reuters that the struggling car maker was running due diligence on 10 bidders. Its shares gave up 5.6 per cent to $1.52.Energy producers lost ground as the price of oil fell back following its recent rally, during which it reached new highs for the year. Oil was trading $0.96 lower at $57.67 per barrel of US crude early on Wall Street, while Chevron lost 2.9 per cent to $68.36 and Exxon Mobil dropped 1.7 per cent to $69.18.Intel rose ahead of the European Union’s decision on whether to approve action against the company after a decade-long investigation into allegations that it abused its dominant market position to force out its main competitor from the market. Lawyers predicted any potential fine could be one of the heaviest ever implemented in Europe, but the stock edged 0.6 per cent upwards to $15.38.Elsewhere in the sector Microsoft slid 0.6 per cent to $19.31 after the company that it would sell debt in order to take advantage of its rare triple-AAA credit rating. The company has resisted taking on debt for years.Target slipped slightly ahead of an impending shareholder meeting at which Bill Ackman, the billionaire activist investor, was due to call for the replacement of several board members, saying they do not have relevant expertise to compete with rival retailer Wal-Mart. Its shares declined 2.4 per cent to $42.76.Investors responded negatively to News Corp’s plan to charge users of the Wall Street Journal’s website by the article. The “micro-payments” system would mark a change from current subscription models, but investors avoided the stock on Monday, sending it 2.4 per cent lower to $9.43.European stocks were down early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index faling 1.6 per cent to 852.17 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by a 0.2 per cent rise in the Nikkei to a on a six-month closing high of 9,451.98 points.Bond yields were down. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 6 basis points to 0.923 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note slid 8bp to 3.206 per cent.The dollar rebounded from a four-month low against major currencies early in New York. It rose 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.51.Gold was trading $0.38 lower at $913.28 per troy ounce.
114;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-05-11T15:09:52Z;Banks to raise $7.5bn to repay Tarp;;Three US banks that passed government stress tests last week announced stock offerings on Monday in an effort to raise capital to repay federal funds.Capital One Financial, a leading issuer of credit cards, US Bancorp, the regional bank based in Minnesota, and BB&T, which operates banks mostly in the south-eastern US, between them set to raise $7.55bn by issuing new shares.The banks were among the nine US banks, out of a total of 19 that were stress-tested, that were said not to require additional capital cushions in the event that the economic downturn worsens. The move to offer common stock and repurchase shares bought by the government signals that US banks are feeling more confident in their ability to function independently.Last week the US Treasury said that the issuance of non-Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-backed debt was a condition for financial groups that want to repay funds received under the Tarp. It said that companies that had received such funds must be able to issue senior unsecured debt for a term of more than five years without FDIC guarantees to show that they can meet funding needs without government help.Capital One said it would offer 56m shares of common stock and would use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and to repay the $3.55bn in Treasury funds it received through the troubled asset relief programme.“We believe our balance sheet is a source of strength for Capital One and positions us well to continue to serve the banking and borrowing needs of our consumer, small business, and commercial customers,” Richard Fairbank, Capital One’s chief executive, said last week. “The results of the banking regulators’ stress test of Capital One confirm the strength and resilience of our capital.”US Bancorp announced it would sell $2.5bn in common stock to the public. Like Capital One, US Bancorp – parent to the sixth largest US commercial bank – said it would use capital it raises to repay the $6.6bn it took in Tarp funds.Separately on Monday, BB&T said that it would offer $1.5bn in common stock. It said it would use the capital raised toward its tangible common equity and tier-one capital, and that it would begin to repay the $3.1bn in preferred stock and warrants it issued to the US Treasury for the capital purchase programme.”I am pleased to announce that BB&T is poised to be one of the first large financial institutions to repay the government investment,” Kelly King, BB&T’s chief executive, said in a statement.”Following the favourable results of the government’s rigorous stress test and consistent with our own internal projections that BB&T has sufficient capital under an adverse economic scenario, our board of directors has approved a plan that effectively positions BB&T for the long term.”BB&T also said it would slash its third-quarter dividend by 68 per cent, saving $725m in capital annually.Meanwhile, KeyCorp, which was told to raise $1.8bn, said on Monday that it would sell up to $750m in common stock as a “first leg” to fulfill its requirements.Many banks which were directed to raise capital have already begun to do so. Last week Wells Fargo, which needs to plug a gap of $13.7bn, launched a $6bn equity issuance, while Morgan Stanley said that it would sell $2bn in shares and $3bn in non-government-backed debt to fill its $1.8bn capital requirement. Citigroup, which needs $5.5bn in additional equity, said that it would expand an existing offer to convert preferred shares.Bank of America said that it would add $17bn in equity through a share sale and the conversion of preferred shares held by non-government investors. It also plans to raise the money through earnings and the possible sale of assets, including asset manager Columbia Management and First Republic Bank.Shares of BB&T fell by 3.1 per cent to $25.50 in early New York trading on Monday. Capital One shares fell 8.6 per cent to $28.64 and US Bancorp slid by 5.6 per cent to $19.39.

116;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-04-23T00:19:56Z;Obama moves to fulfil credit card fees pledge;;Congress and the White House are moving to rewrite the rules of the credit card industry to tackle fees and practices that consumer groups claim are abusive.Barack Obama, the US president, will on Thursday meet executives from 14 credit card issuers, including American Express, Bank of America, Capital One Financial, Citigroup, Discover Financial Services, and JPMorgan Chase, to discuss concerns over practices such as raising interest rates on existing balances.On Wednesday, a congressional panel was expected to approve a bill that would curb high credit card fees and penalties imposed by many banks that have benefited from the federal government’s financial bail-out programme. The proposals are similar to sweeping rules adopted by US federal regulators in December. These rules take effect in July 2010, but the bill’s approval would accelerate their implementation, forcing the country’s banking industry to forgo billions of dollars of annual interest payments sooner.The regulator’s rules impose strict new disclosure standards on credit card lenders and prohibit pricing practices that have been criticised for exposing borrowers to unforeseen costs.The pro-consumer bill is an important test of the political will of Democrats who are pushing for US financial regulation reform.During his presidential campaign, Mr Obama made an issue of excessive credit card fees but he has since been largely silent on the matter. As a candidate, he also favoured legislation to make it easier for troubled homeowners to use bankruptcy courts to ease the terms of their mortgages.
117;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-04-22T20:52:15Z;US stocks fall in volatile trading;;"US equities fell on Wednesday as a late sell-off in the financial sector erased gains made during a choppy trading day on Wall Street as investors digested another busy day of earnings.Morgan Stanley fell after bad debts and real estate writedowns wiped out trading gains during the first quarter. The stock lost 9 per cent to $22.44.Capital One exacerbated ongoing fears of rising bad debts in the financial sector after reporting heavier losses than expected and putting aside more money for future defaults.It raised its guidance for the amount of money it would lose from defaulted payments, saying there was “significant uncertainty” over the outlook, and its shares closed 4.5 per cent down at $14.38.The results kept the markets lower despite a rally during the day triggered
by comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, that the government wanted to retreat from the banking sector as soon as possible.“What Mr Geithner knows that the market does not is the results of the bank stress tests,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams. “I would assume he thinks they are relatively positive or he wouldn’t be thinking we are out of the woods yet.”But neither Mr Geithner’s comments nor figures showing house prices unexpectedly rose during March were able to lift the gloom by the time the markets closed.Even Wells Fargo got caught in the late selling in spite of doubling its revenues to $21bn as more homeowners paid to refinance their mortgages.The bank sparked a steep rally earlier in the month by predicting record profits. But chief financial officer Howard Atkins sounded a more cautious note when he said he did not know what the government would say following their evaluation of lenders’ balance sheets. The company’s shares fell 3.4 per cent to $18.18.The benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.8 per cent to 843.55 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 7,886.57 points. The Nasdaq Composite index once more outperformed the other two, gaining 0.1 per cent to 1,646.12 points.“It seems we are stuck again,” said Colin Cieszynski of CMC Markets. “We are trading in a range, and that is simply part of the bottoming process.”The Nasdaq was bolstered by Yahoo, the internet search company, which said it would cut 5 per cent of its worldwide staff after reporting earnings in line with expectations. The company’s shares gained 0.7 per cent to $14.48.Telecoms was a top performer on the S&P after AT&T reported earnings considerably ahead of estimates with revenues bolstered by customers transferring data over wireless services, especially on Apple’s iPhone. That boosted AT&T’s shares 1.8 per cent to $25.74.Apple lost 0.2 per cent to $121.51 ahead of earnings due out after the bell.Several industrial companies gained as Mr Geithner said he saw some stabilisation of global demand, helping the sector perform better than any other on the S&P.General Electric’s shares rose 0.9 per cent to $11.80 as its top executives addressed a shareholder meeting, during which Jeff Immelt, chief executive, reiterated his prediction that the company’s finance arm would make a profit for 2009.Meanwhile, Caterpillar built on the previous session’s gains, which came on the back of better-than- expected results, after JPMorgan upgraded the company to “overweight”. Its shares gained 3.4 per cent to $32.45.Boeing climbed, even though it made less profit than analysts predicted as the company kept its full-year earnings forecasts above analysts’ estimates. The stock gained 1.8 per cent to $37.30.Ingersoll-Rand, which makes refrigeration equipment, announced a narrower loss than expected and its shares rose 15.7 per cent to $19.35.Freeport McMoRan, the copper maker, bucked the trend, however, after reporting tumbling revenues and profits on weak demand and low metals prices.Its shares fell 0.7 per cent to $40.45.Elsewhere, Gilead Sciences was one of the top gainers on the S&P, advancing 5.7 per cent to $46.22 after reporting rising revenues on the back of strong sales of its Aids drugs."
118;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-04-20T20:46:03Z;Wall Street falls despite strong earnings;;Banks gave US stocks their worst day since the recent rally began in spite of better than expected results from Bank of America.The bank made strong earnings but the shares plunged 24.3 per cent to $8.02 as the company warned about “extremely difficult challenges”, especially from deteriorating credit quality.Other banks also struggled after The New York Times reported that the Obama administration was considering converting loans made to big banks into common stock, thereby putting money into them without having to ask Congress.Investors were nervous about the idea, which some called “back-door nationalisation”, and Citigroup fell 19.5 per cent to $2.94 while Wells Fargo dropped 16.1 per cent to $17. Citigroup was also hampered by bearish analysis from Goldman Sachs, which said credit losses at the banking giant were growing at a “rapid rate”. Capital One, the credit card company, was one of the sector’s biggest fallers after Goldman Sachs cut the company from “buy” to “neutral”. Its shares lost 25 per cent to $13.38.A report in the FT that banks would be able to return bail-out money only if it was in the economic interest also hurt the sector.“Investors were disappointed that paying back Tarp (troubled asset relief programme) money looked further away, and then the news on deteriorating credit from BofA tipped them over the edge,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 4.3 per cent lower at 832.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.6 per cent to 7,841.73 points and the Nasdaq Composite index gave up 3.9 per cent to 1,608.21 points.But on the busiest day yet of the earnings season, a piece of acquisition news was the biggest surprise.Oracle, the software company, said it had offered $9.50 a share to buy its rival Sun Microsystems, which had been involved in take­over talks with IBM.Sun’s shares jumped 36.8 per cent to $9.15, while Oracle lost 1.3 per cent to $18.82.Shares of IBM fell as investors moved to anticipate the company’s results, due out after the close.The stock, which has risen more than 20 per cent since the market hit a low in March, dropped 0.8 per cent to $100.43.The takeover offer failed to spark a rally, even as several companies reported better first-quarter results than expected.Drug company Eli Lilly reported earnings that were better than both the same period last year and estimates for this period, but its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $32.99 as investors worried about weaker sales of its brand-name drugs.Halliburton, the energy conglomerate, also beat expectations, although with falling revenues and profits, and its stock gained 0.1 per cent to $18.79 after falling during the morning’s trade.PepsiCo was another company to fall in spite of reporting better results than anticipated. The company announced it was to offer about $6bn to buy the shares it does not already own in its two largest bottlers. This outweighed rising earnings, and its shares lost 4.4 per cent to $49.86. Shares in Pepsi Bottling Group rose 21.9 per cent to $30.73.Hasbro, the toymaker, was one of the few companies whose results did not beat expectations on Monday morning, with low consumer spending during the Christmas season hurting sales. The shares gave up 2.7 per cent to $27.16 after rallying on Friday following better profit margins than expected from its rival Mattel.Steel makers suffered after Bloomberg quoted a company official at Arcelor Mittal, the world’s biggest steel company, as saying it may halve the size of a planned plant in India and indefinitely defer a second facility amid low demand for cars and homes. As metals prices declined during the day, US Steel lost 11.3 per cent to $26.58 and AK Steel dropped 14.2 per cent to $10.25.Lennar, the homebuilder, was one of the heaviest fallers on the S&P after the company said it planned to sell up to $275m in common stock for possible use as working capital and to repay debt. Its shares lost 18.6 per cent to $7.60.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, said: “The majority of the bad news is behind us, but we had a nice run up and a lot of people are now covering their positions.”
119;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-04-16T03:13:10Z;Wall Street set to open lower;;US stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning as lower than expected inflation figures and good news from Procter & Gamble balanced fears about demand in the technology sector.Procter & Gamble gave consumer companies a much needed boost amid falling retail sales numbers and and negative words on the economy from Mike Duke, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, after the company raised its dividend for the 52nd straight year. It lifted its quarterly shareholder payout 10 per cent to $0.44, and its shares picked up 2.5 per cent to $48.44.This helped the consumer staples sector perform better than any other on the benchmark S&P 500 index, despite Mr Duke saying there would be no quick end to the recession.But Intel fuelled concerns about consumer demand in the technology sector after it refused to give formal guidance for its second quarter earnings despite reporting better results than expected.The company said it had made $0.11 of net profit per share, compared to expectations of just $0.03. But visibility remained low, and the company would only say that for internal purposes, it expected revenues for the second quarter to be roughly in line with those seen during the first three months of the year.The shares fell on the lack of clarity, losing 4.7 per cent to $15.26. Rival chip maker National Semiconductor also fell, dropping ?3 per cent to $11.88, while Microsoft gave up 2.8 per cent to $18.81.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned the market could have priced in better earnings than analyst had predicted, which could mean equity falls even after strong results. “Intel provided good results compared to printed expectations, but the market reacted poorly to margin guidance. The aftermarket selling may hint that the trade is too long into earnings,” he wrote.CPI numbers showed inflation was lower than expected, with prices for March falling 0.1 per cent, and gaining 0.2 per cent excluding food and energy. But this failed to spark a rally in equities, with investors more concerned about the lack of demand for US goods and services.Concern over future revenues for technology companies led the Nasdaq lower, falling 0.6 per cent to 1,615.51 points. But the S&P rose 0.1 per cent to 842.52 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 7,942.56 points.Mortgage applications fell for the week ending April 10 for the first time in over a month, putting some pressure on financial stocks, which have fallen recently as data have shaken confidence that the country will soon see the beginnings of an economic recovery.Citigroup, which was one of the few banks to find gains on Tuesday, fell back 4.5 per cent to $3.83 in early trade, while Bank of America lost 5.5 per cent to $9.53.Credit card companies added to the gloom in financial stocks after Capital One said that customer defaults rose in March along with the unemployment rate. Capital One lost 4.2 per cent to $16.36, while Discover gave up 2.8 per cent to $8.45 and Mastercard retreated 2.9 per cent to $161.30.As earnings season began to hit full speed, there was negative news from the bigger companies reporting their first quarter results.Peabody Energy disappointed the market despite reporting increased sales and revenue by making only $0.50 per share in earnings compared to consensus estimates of $0.95. The company also deferred providing full-year targets, with future demand still unclear. Its shares fell 11.7 per cent to $25.92.Abbott Laboratories also fell despite reporting increased profits. The company made $0.73 per share in earnings compared to estimates of $0.70, but this was fuelled by one-off gains, and with global sales declining, including those of its top-selling drug Humira, its shares lost 3.7 per cent to $43.04.General Motors continued to pick up ground, however, after Bloomberg reported encouraging signs of agreement between bondholders and the United Auto Workers union over retiree healthcare plans as the company seeks to restructure. Its shares gained 5.6 per cent to $1.88.Allegheny Energy was the biggest riser on the S&P, after Barclays raised the utility company to “overweight” from “equal weight”, saying the company may benefit from an auction for Pennsylvania power prices. The company’s shares picked up 6.6 per cent to $25.97.European stocks were down early on Wall Street, driven lower by poor results from Swiss bank UBS. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.4 per cent lower at 786.71 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly down, with the FTSE Asia-Pacific index giving up 0.4 per cent to 168.08 points.Bond yields were little changed, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note gaining 2 basis point to 0.867 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note unchanged at 2.783 per cent.The dollar was higher against major currencies early in New York, rising 0.1 per cent against the euro to $1.3250, and 0.2 per cent on the yen to Y99.03.Gold was trading $0.42 higher at $891.09 per troy ounce.Oil prices were also up, and back abovfe the $50 mark. US crude prices were $0.65 higher at $50.06 a barrel.
120;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-04-15T18:14:40Z;Capital One raises card alarm;;Concerns over US credit card companies grew on Wednesday as Capital One Financial, a leading issuer,said its credit card loss rates were exceeding the unemployment rate.Credit card writedowns have topped the jobless rate on a handful of occasions in the past, and only once by any significant margin. That was in 2005 as a flood of borrowers entered bankruptcy and wrote off their credit card debt before the passage of a law that made it harder to file for bankruptcy.Credit card loss rates have in the past closely tracked the rate of unemployment. But in this recession that relationship is breaking down. Economists say this is because job losses, which pushed rates to 8.5 per cent in March, have compounded other sources of distress such as housing woes and stock volatility.Meanwhile, as the recession has deepened, bankruptcy filings are once more approaching pre-2005 levels, contributing to the rate of credit card losses.Capital One said its net charge-off rate for US cardholders – debts it believes it will never collect – rose to 9.33 per cent in March, up 1.27 percentage points in one month. It said some of the increase was because February has fewer days. Adjusted, the US card charge-off rate would have been 9 per cent in March.After an early fall of 6.9 per cent, its shares closed up 1.88 per cent while, of the other large issuers, Bank of America rose 3.67 per cent and Citigroup fell 1.25 per cent. American Express reversed early declines to rise 11.88 per cent after it reported that credit card losses of 8.6 per cent in March were offset by the sale to third parties of some previously written-off card loans.Brian Shniderman, head of the US credit card practice at Deloitte, said job losses had a “ripple effect” on the credit card business as even consumers who still had jobs adjusted how often and how much they spent.“You can estimate that for every person directly facing unemployment, at least five other people will be impacted secondarily, and change their payments-related behaviours. So while there has clearly been a direct correlation between unemployment and defaults, its impact actually increases due to the increasing role of the secondary ripple effect.”US credit card charge-offs soared in February to 8.82 per cent, a record in the 20-year history of Moody’s credit card index. Moody’s predicts the charge-off rate will peak at about 10.5 per cent in the first half of 2010, assuming a peak in the unemployment rate of 10 per cent.
121;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-03-19T20:54:57Z;Wall St retreats on stimulus scepticism;;"US stocks fell on Thursday as investors continued to react to the Federal Reserve’s bold plan to buy up assets in order the stimulate the economy.Financials fell steeply, outweighing rises in materials and energy stocks, as investors bet the plan would not be as beneficial for banks as hoped, but would trigger a rise in commodity prices and a fall in the dollar.Banking stocks had surged on Wednesday as investors bet their balance sheets would be cleared of distressed assets. But on Thursday, many were more sceptical of the move and the financial sector fell below where it had been before the Fed’s announcement.They had earlier risen as figures showed that first-time unemployment claims fell to 646,000 from 658,000 last week, against consensus estimates of 655,000.But the fallout from the Fed plan soon started to dominate investors’ thinking once more, and banks were further weighed down that a new 90 per cent tax rate on bonuses for high earning bankers at companies which had taken over $5bn from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp) could trigger an exodus of talent.JPMorgan closed 8 per cent down at $24.95, Morgan Stanley fell 13 per cent to $21.04 and Goldman Sachs dropped 5.7 per cent to $99.30.Credit card companies were also big fallers after Discover announced an operating loss of $0.36 per share for the first quarter. The company said it would cut its dividend from $0.06 per share to $0.02, and its shares lost 13.3 per cent to $6.28. American Express also fell, dropping 7.2 per cent to $13.07, while Capital One gave up 13.6 per cent to $12.30.Shares in Citigroup, which have more than tripled in the past two weeks, were particularly volatile, as the company announced it had begun plans to swap $5.3bn worth of preference shares into common stock. After an initial rise of more than
11 per cent, they slumped 15.6 per cent to $2.60.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.3 per cent down at 784.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent lower at 7,400.8 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 1,483.48.“The aggressive move by the Fed is stoking inflation expectations and there is a belief that a lot of money could flow into commodities or other inflation hedges,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MFGlobal. “This is suppressing the price of equities.”Others warned that the Fed’s actions could only be judged on a more long-term view however.“We need to let the Fed’s efforts begin to work,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group. “They will help clear the balance sheets of good banks, but that will take time.”The oil price rose sharply on Thursday to its highest level this year, which boosted the price of energy stocks. Chevron gained 0.8 per cent to $67.13.Materials also gained on hopes that a weaker dollar would boost demand for US goods from overseas buyers.Alcoa the largest US aluminium producer, lifted 16.8 per cent to $6.40, bolstered also when JPMorgan raised its estimates of the company’s earnings for 2009 and 2010.The steel sector was another strong performer. Nucor gained 7.2 per cent to $38.08, US Steel picked up 9.2 per cent to $20.94 and AK Steel rose 8.8 per cent to $7.55. AK Steel was also helped by news of a $5bn Treasury bail-out for car parts makers, which lifted the big carmakers. GM one of AK’s biggest customers, rose 8.7 per cent to $2.87.There was further good news for the technology sector, as Oracle announced better profits than expected and said it would pay its first quarterly dividend. Its shares rose 9.7 per cent to $17.37.General Electric fell however after it told investors it was likely to see a smaller profit in its financial arm than previously predicted as the economy had worsened faster than expected. Rapidly rising job losses had hit the consumer-credit business, executives said, and the company’s shares lost 1.8 per cent to $10.13.Earnings for FedEx, the delivery company, missed analysts’ estimates but its shares rose 4.8 per cent to $45.10 after executives said they did not expect a further significant deterioration in the economy this year."

123;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-03-16T19:56:14Z;Wall St snaps four-day winning streak;;US stocks fell sharply in late trade, giving up previous gains to finish slightly below Friday’s close as American Express announced more people had trouble paying credit card bills in February.The news prompted a slump in the company’s shares, which finished 3.3 per cent down at $12.66. It also dragged down the financial sector, which had enjoyed an early banking-led rally.Shares in Citigroup surged back above $2, gaining 30.9 per cent to $2.33 as confidence in the banking sector continued to rise after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, reassured the public that economic recovery would begin in 2009 if government action worked.He said the country’s leading banks were solvent, adding that he already saw some “green shoots” of recovery.The sector was also given a boost when Barclays of the UK added its name to the big banks that have said they started the year well.Last week Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan all said they were profitable for the first two months of 2009.Bank of America rose 7.3 per cent to $6.18 but JPMorgan fell after American Express’ announcement, losing 2.8 per cent to $23.09.Financial companies were also helped by messages from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which proposed changes to the mark-to-market accounting rule, which has been blamed for exacerbating worries over financial companies’ capital positions.The board proposed allowing companies to exercise more judgment in determining if a market for an asset is active and if a transaction is “distressed” when measuring the value of an asset.Insurers were buoyed by the news, with MetLife picking up 8.1 per cent to $19.17 and Prudential lifting 1.8 per cent to $19.10.Capital One provided some relief from American Express’ news after it announced reduced the numbers of auto loans it believes will never be repaid. Its shares gained 0.1 per cent to $12.57.But many investors still feel the recent rally by financial stocks is flimsy. Terry Morris, senior vice president at National Penn Investors Trust Company, said: “Citi’s rise is based on speculative buying that leads to short-covering. The company is not 40 per cent better than it was on Friday.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 753.89, having earlier been over 2 per cent higher, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 7,216.97.Weakness from the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq Composite index, which lost 1.9 per cent to 1,404.02.Cisco announced on Monday it was to sell servers for data systems in partnership with smaller technology companies. Its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $15.45.Analysts said the deal might herald other large companies in the sector snapping up smaller rivals, but shares in many of those companies still fell as investors moved their money back into riskier sectors.Oracle, which was named specifically by Barron’s, the publication for investors, as a potential purchaser, was one of the biggest drags on the sector, losing 4.2 per cent to $14.90. Intel meanwhile fell 3.1 per cent to $14.25 and Dell dropped 5 per cent to $8.90.Investors had looked to the cash-rich technology sector as a defensive trade but as financials strengthened, it became the day’s biggest faller. Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “People are coming back to the financial sector and seeing some recovery in healthcare stocks.”Industrial stocks were led higher by General Electric, in spite of figures released on Monday morning showing that industrial production had fallen by more than expected.Investors took confidence from UBS, which removed its short-term “sell” recommendation on the company and the company’s shares rose 0.4 per cent to $9.66.Consol Energy rallied in spite of the falling price of oil, rising 5.5 per cent to $27.48 after Barron’s said the company had a strong balance sheet and low operating costs, making it a bargain.Shares in CV Therapeutics fell 5 per cent to $19.64 after Astellas, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, confirmed it would not enter into a bidding war with Gilead Sciences for the company. Gilead lost 2.7 per cent to $44.19.
124;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-03-13T20:55:21Z;Health care sector provides Wall St tonic gains;;US stocks clung on to their gains on Friday during a choppy trading session as rises in healthcare stocks took equities to their best weekly performance since November.Merck, the pharmaceutical company, gained 12.7 per cent to $27.07 after Bernstein upgraded the company to “outperform”, saying it had agreed a “very fair price” for rival Schering-Plough. Schering-Plough also gained, rising 8.5 per cent to $24.21.Humana, the health insurer, also gained on speculation reported by Bloomberg that it was the subject of a takeover bid. Its shares rose 7.7 per cent to $24.83.But CV Therapeutics lost ground after Japan’s Astellas said it might not re-bid for the company after it accepted a rival bid from Gilead Sciences. CV lost 1.8 per cent to $20.67.The financial sector finished in positive territory as gains in the banking sector outweighed fears over bad debts in the credit card market. Banks received a boost after Richard Parsons, the chairman of Citigroup, said the bank would not need more capital injections from government, further allaying fears of nationalisation. Citi gained 6.6 per cent to $1.78, and JPMorgan picked up 2.4 per cent to $23.75.But credit card companies Discover Financial and Capital One both lost out, the latter after announcing a change to executives’ compensation schemes that will convert cash bonuses and equity incentives into salary and restricted stock. Discover fell 5.9 per cent to $6.23 and Capital One lost 5.6 per cent to $12.56.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both gained 0.8 per cent to 756.55 points and 7,223.98 points respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.4 per cent at 1,431.5 points. The gains followed a surge on Thursday after Ken Lewis, chief executive of Bank of America, became the third leading bank boss to say his company had been profitable for the first two months of 2009.The market was given a boost late on Thursday when President Barack Obama said he would be willing to consider lowering the corporate tax rate if people within business helped him to close tax loopholes.The energy sector put pressure on the S&P after OPEC cut its forecast for oil demand, with Chevron losing 0.8 per cent to $62.91.Palm was one of the biggest gainers after RBC Capital Markets upgraded the cellphone manufacturer to outperform from sector perform, based on its plans to dominate the smartphone market. Its shares lifted 6.7 per cent to $8.39.It was not all good news for technology stocks, as National Semiconductor, the chipmaker, was downgraded to junk status by Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency. The company lost 8.8 per cent to $10.05.Warren Buffett spent Monday talking up the stocks he holds, but his company remains too exposed to losses on its portfolio, says Fitch, which cut Berkshire Hathaway’s AAA rating. Shares then fell 3.2 per cent.
125;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-03-09T22:00:12Z;Wall Street slides on telecoms pressure;;"US stocks resumed their steady falls into levels not seen since September 1996 as pressure from the telecoms sector outweighed a good day for financial stocks.Both Verizon and AT&T, the biggest US telecoms companies, fell, bringing down the sector, which has outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index over the past few weeks. The correction came partly on the back of a comment from Doreen Toben, Verizon’s executive vice-president, that the company was seeing “some revenue softness that we believe is cyclical and related to the economy”.Verizon lost 4 per cent to $26.18. AT&T fell 3.8 per cent to $21.72.But there was good news from the financial sector, which helped the equities markets pare their losses.Bank of America was one of the biggest gainers, having sold $8.5bn of debt guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its shares rose 19.4 per cent to $3.75.The bank was also boosted by Barron’s, the financial magazine, which said it would be an “earnings power­house” once the economy recovered.Warren Buffett, the investor, helped give the sector confidence after standing
by his holdings in Wells Fargo and US Bancorp, which he said should appear “better than ever” in three years’ time. Wells Fargo rose 15.8 per cent to $9.97 and
US Bancorp was up 15.5 per cent at $10.19.Capital One, the credit card company, found gains in spite of slashing its dividend from 37.5 to 5 cents per share. It gained 5.1 per cent to $8.73.The sector took solace from the Treasury after Barack Obama named three people to top positions there.But Todd Salomone, senior vice-president of research at Schaeffer’s, warned that any rally in financials would be short lived. “Throughout the last month we have seen bounces amid the decline, and that’s what we’re seeing now. But it will be only a bounce,” he said.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford, said that some investors were also buying banking stocks in the hope that the government would
suspend mark-to-market accounting in the next week.“That would be the quickest and cheapest way to stabilise the system in the absence of any grander plan,” she said.The bullish day for banks came in spite of two Republicans calling for banks to be nationalised.Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Senate banking committee, and Senator John McCain both suggested they would like to see major banks taken into government control.A deal in the pharmaceuticals industry failed to ignite the sector. Merck said it would buy Schering-Plough for $41bn, a 34 per cent premium to the price of the latter’s shares by the close of markets on Friday.The gap in the share prices between the two companies rapidly closed after the announcement. Merck fell 7.7 per cent to $20.99. Schering-Plough picked up 14.2 per cent to $20.13.There was also good news for Genetech, the biotechnology company, after the Wall Street Journal reported that it had accepted a bid from Roche of $95 per share. Shares in Genentech rose
2 per cent to $92.63.However, the healthcare sector lost 0.9 per cent overall. The falls endured by the sector since Mr Obama announced his healthcare plan were exacerbated when UBS downgraded Aflac, the insurer, to “sell”. Aflac’s shares were down 14.5 per cent at $11.49.Two of the market’s most battered stocks, General Motors and General Electric, found gains as investors continued to speculate on the future of both companies.GM rose 15.9 per cent to $1.68, having fallen 35.6 per cent last week as its auditors warned over it status as a going concern.Investors were attracted to GE, which fell heavily last week. Shares in the group were helped by Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive, who said the financial “Armageddon” would leave his company intact. They rose 5 per cent to $7.41.Confidence in GE’s stock was also boosted by the announcement that the company planned to sell debt backed by the FDIC.The S&P 500 was down 1 per cent to 676.53, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 1.2 per cent to 6,547.05, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2 per cent at 1,268.64."
126;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-02-17T21:41:00Z;Banks drive Wall St to new low for year;;Financial stocks were the hardest hit in a broad-based sell-off on Wall Street on Tuesday that pushed the market to its lowest level of the year.Big-name banks did particularly badly as the S&P 500 slumped beneath the psychologically significant 800 level for the first time since November, which prompted concerns among technical analysts that the benchmark index would test an 11-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, closed on Tuesday within a hairsbreadth of a fresh low for the financial crisis.JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America lost 12.3 per cent to $21.65, 13.1 per cent to $13.69 and 12 per cent to $4.90, respectively, as fears of outright nationalisation of a key institution persisted and investors continued to seek clarity over the Obama administration’s plans to shore up the sector.“All eyes are on Washington,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.Credit card stocks came under heavy selling pressure after American Express, down 11.3 per cent to $13.96, warned that credit card delinquencies rose last month.Meanwhile, Capital One also warned defaults on its US-issued cards rose last month, prompting fears that the bank’s dividend was at risk. The shares dropped 16.4 per cent to $10.13, which Friedman, Billings, Ramsey analyst Scott Valentin said was “driven by misplaced chatter over a debt covenant breach.”Regional banks did badly, down 8.7 per cent overall, while the financial sector shed 9.8 per cent.The consumer staples sector failed to find positive territory in spite of better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Wal-Mart, which were helped by strong sales.The world’s largest retailer was one of only eight stocks in the S&P 500 to find positive territory, up 3.7 per cent to $48.24.Although the best performing of the main sectors, consumer staples nevertheless shed 1.8 per cent overall as all 10 industry groups finished sharply in the red.Meanwhile, investors remained concerned that Washington’s $787bn economic stimulus package – which President Obama signed into law on Tuesday– may not be enough to stave-off a deepening recession.“They don’t think the stimulus, the way it’s been presented, is going to do much to the economy in the short term,” Pran Tiku, president of Peak Financial Management, said of the market’s participants. “They have nothing to hang their hat on.”The S&P closed down 4.6 per cent at 789.17, less than 5 per cent away from an 11-year low hit last autumn. The index began the year more than 20 per cent above that nadir.The Dow finished down 3.8 per cent to 7,552.60 and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 4.2 per cent at 1,470.66. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a measure of anxiety known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 12.9 per cent to 48.5.Concerns over the Obama administration’s ability to support the banking sector had pushed financial shares lower in recent sessions.The industrial sector also came under heavy selling pressure after data from the New York Federal Reserve showed manufacturing production in the state fell to its lowest level of the recession so far.Also weighing on the market, General Motors and Chrysler were expected to make clear that they need more government support than the $17.4bn already approved. GM shares were off 12.8 per cent to $2.18 while Ford, which has not yet received any bail-out funds, fell 4 per cent to $1.69.Commodity stocks also did badly. Freeport-Mcmoran dropped 11.1 per cent to $27.12 while energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil, off 4.4 per cent to $71.28, did badly as oil prices fell sharply.However, Newmont Mining jumped 3.4 per cent to $12.49 as gold prices rallied.Elsewhere, Coca-Cola gave back 2.9 per cent to $42.60 following a reasonable performance last week on the back of well-received results. Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling, its second-biggest bottler, disclosed an unexpected fourth-quarter loss and warned it could not provide a forecast for the year.The US markets were closed in the previous session due to the President’s Day holiday.
127;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2009-01-26T00:04:01Z;Peter Fader: How marketing works best with big messy maths;;"Peter Fader is not a fan of “squishy” marketing. Whether a product’s packaging is light or dark blue does not interest him nearly as much as the swathes of hard data consumers generate through their spending habits.“I’ve always been infatuated with crazy and quirky number patterns,” says the 47-year-old New Yorker and professor of marketing at the The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “Whether it’s dollar bills or sports statistics or number plates on cars, I just can’t get enough.”Proof of his numerical predilection is perhaps best demonstrated by the geeky charm of his website coolnumbers.com, which, at the click of a button, provides you with an assessment of how “cool” the serial number on a particular dollar bill is, for example.It has been a lifelong love affair. At the age of 18 he left New York for MIT, determined to find a course that could satisfy his statistical obsession and fulfil his number-crunching dreams.“I searched for courses beyond the usual maths ones – theoretical and abstract – but my interests were more grounded,” he says. Then he came upon a marketing models course.“I had no substantial interest in the subject, but it just happens that there’s a lot of data in the area. So I started looking at people’s purchasing patterns – trying to predict what people would buy next based on what they’ve bought so far. It was a very natural extension of what I did. Before I knew it, there I was sitting in the PhD programme.”It was only because of the rather “forceful” persuasion of his mentors at MIT that he pursued an academic career and went to Wharton.“I told them I wanted to do something real with my life,” he says. “I really did not want to come here, but my fairy godmother – one of my professors – said I would see that it was for my own good.” That was 21 years ago. “I now call her every six months to say, ‘thank you, thank you, thank you’.”By his own admission, Prof Fader is something of a “back-to-front” marketing lecturer. He is a big promoter of the subject’s statistical side – its ‘hard’ core – and he actively discourages people from taking the introduction to marketing before they sign up with his course, which he describes as a “big, ugly, messy maths course, but applied to marketing data”.“Anyone with a real quantitative orientation gets easily turned off by the subject, but if they discover the number side first, then there’s some interest and some motivation to learn.“Learn the substance, learn the meat and then you can learn the façade on top of it all.”The traditional “four Ps” of the marketing world – price, promotion, place, product – have their place he says, but it is the quantitative aspect of the subject that really fires him up. He firmly believes that these analytical skills are essential to the success of any marketing department – particularly in the current economic climate.“The CMO [chief marketing officer] …doesn’t appreciate this stuff at all. He or she will say, ‘Well, I have these metrics people in the back room and I’ll let them out when I have a specific question for them, but I’m not going to let them run the company’. I find that very, very distressing. The analogy would be a CFO [chief financial officer] who doesn’t understand accounting.“I’m hoping the recession will force a change for more accountability.”Some have caught on, however. More retailers choose to play “the numbers game”, and pay hefty fees for consultants to crunch consumer data.But Prof Fader says that, in most cases, such enterprises are likely to fail for a simple reason: they are gathering too much information.“Many of these companies are going to collapse under their own weight because they’re not going to be able to deliver in the way that they’re promising.“They’re going to find that it is really hard and inefficient to [gather data] individual by individual and it’s going to force us to take a step back.”Rather than defining a consumer by gender or income band, Prof Fader recommends grouping people into behavioural cohorts. He cites Tesco, the UK supermarket chain with a loyalty card system, and Capital One, the credit card issuer, as businesses that are getting it right.These companies “live and die by the metrics. [They] are defining cohorts of customers, running experiments, reading the results, acting on them – that’s the lifeblood of the business; it’s not just something that a few geeks and nerds are doing in the back room.”He is especially interested in technological advances providing new tools for collecting data.A project he is involved in, The Wharton Interactive Media Initiative, is looking at how digital media can help the development of marketing models.Of particular interest is the role of the internet, and the vast amounts of data its use offers a man such as Prof Fader.“What’s remarkable is how people’s movement around a store, for example, has a lot of parallels with their movement on a website.”But there are some for whom the collection of such information is questionable. As the digital age charges ahead, are we not at risk of losing too many privacy rights?“A lot of the fuss about privacy has been a tempest in a teapot,” he says.“It turns out you need very little in terms of deep, private information to make accurate projections about a customer. You don’t need 600 measures about the consumer, you don’t need to be doing extensive surveys or brainscans or personality profiles. Most of that stuff is not particularly predictive.“All I need is just a few summary measures about their actual behaviour and that will help me do the job just as well, if not better. Our ability to micro-target is surprisingly limited.”So what are his predictions for spending habits in 2009?“It will be largely similar to the behaviour of 2008,” he asserts.“At the individual level, someone’s basic [shopping] patterns rarely change.”“The external stimulus that the recession creates might shake things up a little bit, but the inherent randomness of people’s shopping dominates these external shocks.”"

129;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2008-10-29T23:49:21Z;Visa warns of tough three years ahead;;Visa reported better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter on Wednesday on higher transaction volumes, but said it expected revenue for the next three years to be at the low end of previous guidance amid the global economic slowdown.The credit card processor reported a net loss of $356m, or 45 cents a share, for the three months ended September 30, its third quarter as a public company. That compared with a $1.66bn loss a year earlier.However, excluding litigation reserves and restructuring charges, earnings were 58 cents a share for the quarter, and $2.25 a share for the full year 2008.Visa and MasterCard are sidestepping the rising customer defaults at other card companies such as American Express and Capital One because they collect fees to process payments between financial institutions but do not take the risk of making loans to consumers.“In the face of a tough economic environment in the US and internationally, the relative resiliency of the Visa business model was in evidence,” said Joe Saunders, chief executive of Visa.Lenders have reported declining profits as they put aside more money for future losses amid rising US unemployment and a battered housing market.Payment processers such as Visa and MasterCard are exposed to the potential for lower overall spending volumes as consumers tighten their belts but, even as the US economy slows, the growing adoption of card-based payments in the US and overseas has helped contribute to growth.Revenues rose 17 per cent to $1.71bn as spending on Visa cards climbed 15 per cent to $699bn and transaction volume rose 19 per cent. The number of Visa-branded cards rose 12 per cent worldwide to 1.6bn. Mastercard is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings next week.While the rate of growth in credit card transactions slowed in the quarter, Visa said the rate of growth in debit payments continued to accelerate. Debit payment processing represented more than half of Visa’s payment transactions worldwide.“Debit is particularly important to our results in the current environment, as that product is rooted in everyday spend behaviour which has proven to be less susceptible to economic fluctuations and continues to grow,” said Mr Saunders.Shares in Visa fell 0.37 per cent to $50.50 in after hours trading yesterday. The stock has fallen more than 40 per cent from its peak in May.Visa and MasterCard this week reached a $2.75bn settlement of a lawsuit brought by Discover Financial that alleged anti-competitive practices. That followed an earlier $4bn settlement the two companies reached with American Express over similar allegations. Neither MasterCard nor Visa admitted any liability as part of the settlements.
130;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2008-10-17T22:42:18Z;Car lending slashed as default threat rises;;"Banks and finance companies in the US are aggressively cutting back on making car loans, as growing numbers of borrowers fall behind on their payments and lenders’ access to funding is squeezed in the credit crunch.Lenders such as Wells Fargo, Capital One and GMAC this week all reported heavy cuts to their auto lending businesses amid signs that borrowers are increasingly affected by the slowing US economy and rising unemployment.Wells cut its $25bn auto loan portfolio by almost 25 per cent in the third quarter as it pulled back from making riskier loans, while Capital One cut back its volume of car loans by more than half.GMAC, the GM lending unit now 51 per cent owned by Cerberus, the private equity group, tightened rules to issue loans only to high-quality borrowers. Dealers estimate 60 per cent of the customers who buy GM cars will not qualify for loans under the new rules.The pullback from car loans comes as borrowers are struggling to meet payments on their mortgages and, increasingly, on their credit cards.Citigroup this week reported that losses on its global credit card business rose 65 basis points to 7.05 per cent in the third quarter, close to record levels of 7.8 per cent reached in September 2005 prior to changes in the bankruptcy law.Losses on auto loans have more than doubled in the last year, according to Fitch Ratings, as a rise in late payments has been compounded by falling prices for gas-
guzzling vehicles that were popular with US drivers in the boom times.“Current economic conditions and volatile energy prices have led to softness in the wholesale vehicle market with noted declines in light truck and sport utility vehicle values,” said analysts at Fitch.Wells said higher losses on its auto loan portfolio were driven “primarily” by lower used car prices. Prices for large SUVs have declined 21 per cent from a year ago, according to the September Manheim index.The credit crisis has also made it difficult for lenders to fund new loans.Katie Reeves, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “The credit crisis and dearth of funding opportunities for lenders have begun to have ramifications for auto loan availability to consumers. Consumers across the credit spectrum, even those with the best credit, have not been spared by the current credit crunch.”A recent study by CNW Research shows that the number of approved auto loan applications in the US has declined since last year. Prime approvals fell 10.2 per cent, while for subprime borrowers the approval rate is down by 66.1 per cent.Funding difficulties have also had consequences for the car companies. General Motors and Chrysler’s sales of new cars have been hurt in recent weeks because their financing units have had to cut back on auto loans and leasing to conserve capital.“These changes in pricing and underwriting are related to the current market environment, which has reduced access to funds and increased the cost of funds,” GMAC said in a statement this week."
131;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2008-10-15T20:22:42Z;Bank funding costs prompt debt concerns;;Elevated funding costs in the interbank market have pushed up interest rates on a whole range of different types of debt, including deals backed by credit cards and some types of US mortgages.The higher interest payments are further evidence that the crisis in the world’s banking system continues to have knock-on effects on companies and individuals.In spite of measures to stem the crisis in financial markets which followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers bank, including billions of dollars of liquidity injections by the world’s central banks, interest rate cuts and government bank bail-outs, bank funding costs have remained stubbornly high.The benchmark bank lending rate – the London interbank offered rate, or Libor – surged by more than two percentage points in mid-September after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, to over 4.5 per cent. On Wednesday, even though one-month Libor fell slightly, it was still 4.55 per cent.The recent spikes will result in higher interest payments this month on about $250bn of debt issued by special funding vehicles, which is backed by credit card loans.These so-called credit card master trusts, used by providers of credit cards such as Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Capital One and American Express, set their monthly interest rates according to where Libor stands on about the eleventh day of the month, according to Joseph Astorina, an analyst at Barclays Capital.“For the October fixing, one-month Libor is 207 basis points [2.07 percentage points] higher than it was on September 11,” Mr Astorina said. “The Libor spike of the past few weeks …is ominous for credit card master trusts.”Although the increased interest payments can be accommodated within the structures used to fund the credit cards, if Libor remains high for another month, it could start to cause concerns.Temporarily, the special funding vehicles can accommodate increased interest payments. But, longer term, when they have to pay higher interest rates, there are fewer funds to pass on to the banks which issue the credit cards. Already, the economic downturn is expected to increase the level of missed payments and defaults by consumers on their credit card bills.The other sector of the debt markets affected by higher Libor rates is the special type of mortgages on which interest rates are reset at intervals. Often made to risky, subprime borrowers, the so-called adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) are usually referenced to six-month Libor, which has reached 4.39 per cent versus 2.68 per cent six months ago, according to JPMorgan research.“The rise in Libor means mortgage resets are re-emerging as a credit problem,” said a JPMorgan report.“Subprime ARMs that reset will present borrowers with an average 10 to 13 per cent increase in their payment, potentially causing financial hardship,” the report added.
132;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2008-10-14T19:24:58Z;Credit cards;;For a while it seemed that neither record commodity prices nor falling wealth could put a dent in American consumers’ propensity to pay with plastic, but the moment of frugal reckoning is now finally here. August had the biggest drop in revolving debt on record and the last several weeks were probably even worse.The fall in spending and rising late credit card payments have naturally weighed on the financial sector. Lately though, companies such as Visa and MasterCard that depend on transaction volumes rather than creditworthiness have been hit nearly as hard as those facing delinquencies. The largest issuers of credit cards are big banks, but they have many other businesses and have gyrated recently on separate concerns. Three that come close to being pure plays on cards while still having credit exposure are Capital One, American Express and Discover Financial Services and they are off by an average of 51 per cent from their 52 week highs. Visa and Mastercard’s drops of 35 and 46 per cent, respectively, are better but still an overreaction.The future of the two big processors lies in developing markets. These have wobbled recently, but if future penetration rates climb anywhere near their expected pace, processor shares still look attractive. In the not-too-distant future, developed market revenue will merely grow in line with nominal output. In the US, for example, cheques and cash already have dropped from three fourths of spending in the early 1990s to a little over a third today. Worldwide though, these represent an $80,000bn untapped market for cards.At around 27 and 20 times prospective earnings, respectively, Visa and Mastercard might seem expensive in a bombed-out financial sector, but they can still grow earnings respectably if revenue rises in the low teens, several percentage points lower than consensus forecasts. Even if global recession looms, plastic cards are one American export with a bright future.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
133;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2008-09-25T20:40:18Z;Wall Street rallies on bail-out hopes;;Mounting expectations that Congress would speedily pass the proposed $700bn financial sector bail-out bolstered US stocks on Thursday, outweighing a slew of downbeat news elsewhere.Markets brushed aside a profit warning from General Electric and a series of grim economic updates as Washington grew closer to finalising a deal.Financials, up 2.6 per cent, were among the biggest gainers on hopes that the plan would afford paralysed money markets much-needed relief.GE gained 4.4 per cent at $25.68 even after the world’s fourth-largest company cut its third-quarter and full-year earnings forecast and suspended a share buy-back.Market-wide gains also took in housebuilders in spite of data that showed detached family homes in August fell to their lowest level since January 1991. DR Horton and KB Home rallied 5.6 per cent to $13.92 and 4.1 per cent to $21.16, respectively.Other figures showed that the number of workers claiming unemployment benefits jumped last week, and a sharp fall in demand for durable goods. “Industry is in trouble,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients.Yet stocks extended early gains after Chris Dodd, chairman of the US Senate Banking Committee, said negotiators had reached “fundamental agreement” on the principles of the Wall Street bail-out.The S&P 500 closed up 2 per cent at 1,209.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8 per cent at 11,022.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.4 per cent at 2,186.57.Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment, said: “At the end of the day it was going to have to get done [but] was it going to be decorated like a fancy Christmas tree? That’s really where there was a lot of uncertainty, and how fast [it was passed] was also up in the air.”Still, reports that the government would receive an equity stake in companies involved in the bail-out put a lid on more spectacular gains.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 6.8 per cent, although at 32.80 it remained above the psychologically significant level of 30, a sign of distress.A report from Bespoke Investment Group said: “A prolonged Vix above 30 hasn’t happened too often since 1990, and it’s the first time it has happened since January 2003.”Escaping the upward momentum, Washington Mutual sank 25.2 per cent to $1.69 on reports that regulators are trying to quickly broker a deal for the embattled savings and loan institution.Capital One Financial fell another 5.1 per cent at $49.72. The credit card and banking group priced a public share offering at $49 a share.Discover Financial, another credit-card company, which spun off from Morgan Stanley, fell 2.6 per cent at $14.82. More customers were late with payments and its third-quarter net income fell 11 per cent.Meanwhile, in technology, Microsoft gained 3.5 per cent at $26.61 after an appeals court ruled in favour of the software group in its music patent battle against Alcatel-Lucent.The hardware and semiconductor sectors moved higher. The gains came in spite of Wachovia’s issuing a bearish outlook and downgrading its recommendation from “overweight” to “market weight”. The bank forecasts slower growth in personal computer sales.Dell, Intel and Hewlett-Packard gained 1.4 per cent at $16.93, lost 0.7 per cent to $18.57 and gained 2 per cent to $47.70, respectively.Oracle rose 2.6 per cent to $20.47 on reports the computer software group will enter the hardware market.In the consumer discretionary sector, Bed Bath & Beyond gained 4.8 per cent to $32.19 after net income matched analyst estimates. JC Penney inched up 0.1 per cent at $35.90 as Merrill Lynch downgraded its recommendation on the retailer.However, lodging stocks suffered after JPMorgan reduced its estimates on eight because of lower demand.Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Choice Hotels International and Orient-Express Hotels fell 2.3 per cent at $30.70, 3.3 per cent at $27.99 and 5 per cent at $29.75, respectively.
134;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2008-09-24T21:12:56Z;Buffett’s $5bn not enough to lift US equities;;A vote of confidence in the financial system from Warren Buffett failed to lift US stocks into positive territory on Wednesday amid a near seizure in money markets and ongoing uncertainty over the authorities’ proposed bail-out.Equity markets remained jittery in spite of the $5bn investment in Goldman Sachs, from Berkshire Hathaway, Mr Buffett’s investment vehicle. Goldman rose 6.4 per cent to $133.Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at The Hartford, said: “With the backdrop of this drip of negative soundbites [from the congressional hearing] it really was comforting for Warren Buffett to come forward and take a position in the financials.” She added, however, that developments in Washington “overwhelmed” news elsewhere.A jump in money-market interest rates hurt financials as it indicated less trust among lenders. Morgan Stanley, in which Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s largest bank, has agreed to take a 20 per cent stake, lost 11.5 per cent at $24.79 and the cost of protecting its senior debt rose.Citigroup and American Express lost 5.2 per cent at $18.96 and 2 per cent at $37.50, respectively. General Electric fell 1.4 per cent at $24.59 as investors fretted over its financial arm. GE has fallen 12.5 per cent since the upsurge in financing pressures this month.Capital One Financial fell 2.3 per cent at $52.49. Washington Mutual sank 29.4 per cent to $2.26 after Standard & Poor’s cut its credit rating on the savings and loan institution amid fears it will not be able to sell itself.MEMC Electronic Materials jumped 7 per cent to $31 even after the silicon wafer manufacturer cut its third-quarter sales forecast due to Hurricane Ike. RBC Capital upgraded its recommendation, citing an extension of solar tax credits that could help demandLeading indices see-sawed as Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, gave testimony and faced questions from a congressional committee. After a relatively muted session, the S&P 500 closed 0.2 per cent lower at 1,185.88 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent at 10,825.17 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.1 per cent at 2,155.68 points.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 2.8 per cent – surpassing a closing high reached last week that had not been achieved since 2002 – but later stood 1.3 per cent lower at 35.25.Among industrials, HB Fuller lost 3.3 per cent at $22.23 after the speciality chemical group’s earnings met analysts downgraded estimates. Worthington Industries gained 3.2 per cent to $17.11 after the metal processor’s earnings topped analyst forecasts.Renewable energy stocks received a boost after the Senate passed a bill that would extend tax credits for the sector. First Solar and Evergreen Solar rose 5.2 per cent to $221.80 and 7.8 per cent at $6.20, respectively.
135;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2008-09-19T18:48:20Z;Wall St enjoys record two-day rally;;An extraordinary week in Wall Street history drew to a close with one of the biggest two-day rallies on record.Financials, whose violent movements have consistently led the wider market over the week, gained the most from the prospect of a vast government intervention attempting to ease anxiety over near unprecedented turmoil in the financial system.Still, observers said a temporary ban on shorting some stocks had essentially distorted some prices. Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase – all included on the SEC’s list – gained 24 per cent to $20.65, 22.6 per cent to $37.48 and 16.8 per cent to $47.05, respectively.American Express and Capital One – in which shorting was still permitted – enjoyed rather less spectacular gains, up 7.1 per cent at $40.40 and 3.8 per cent at $56.05, respectively.Routed in recent sessions, the financial sector soared 11 per cent.It gained 5.9 per cent over a week that saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers, forced sale of Merrill Lynch and government bail-out of American International Group.Friday’s rally left the S&P 500 up 0.1 per cent over the week, the Dow down 0.3 per cent and the Nasdaq up 0.6 per cent.Stock moves that would traditionally take place over a year occurred in 24-hour periods.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 4 per cent higher on Friday at 1,255.08, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.4 per cent to 11,388.44 while the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.4 per cent to 2,273.90.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 4.3 per cent. Still, at 31.68 it remained above the psychologically significant level of 30 per cent, a sign of distress.A rout on the shares of financial institutions had prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to temporarily halt the short- selling of 799 stocks.The ban is effective until October 2, although it can be extended beyond 10 days if deemed necessary.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, whose analysts advised clients to buy each other’s shares on Friday, jumped 20.7 per cent to $27.21 and 20.2 per cent to $129.80, respectively. That pared their losses over the week to 29.4 per cent and 17.7 per cent.The later remained in talks with China Investment Corp and Wachovia, which climbed 29.3 per cent to $18.75.Meanwhile, Washington Mutual – particularly hard hit in recent sessions and which was continuing on Friday its search for a buyer – soared 42.1 per cent to $3.75.Over the week, it has gained 55.7 per cent.Earlier in the week, co-ordinated action by the world’s central banks failed to stem investor anxiety over the short-term funding of financial institutions.Stocks soared late on Thursday when news leaked that authorities were working on a plan take over the toxic mortgage-related debt that lies at the heart of the global financial crisis.Bill Stone, investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said many financial stocks were trading at favourable multiples “if they survive. The question was whether they survive . . . [and] we’ve raised their odds of survival.”He added, however, that the “devil is in the detail”.“People are prematurely declaring victory,” said Doug Roberts, investment strategist at ChannelCapitalResearch.com.Meanwhile, General Motors, which has exposure to troubled mortgage assets through its GMAC arm, soared 14.7 per cent to $12.91.General Electric, whose financial arm accounts for about half of its business, rose 7.4 per cent to $27.10, erasing losses from earlier in the week.
136;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2008-09-04T20:43:33Z;US stocks tumble on poor retail sales figures;;A battered financial sector led Wall Street into bear market territory on Thursday, as Bill Gross, manager of the bond fund Pimco, warned that a “financial tsunami” could ensue if the government failed to support markets.Credit-card groups were among the key casualties as fears grew of rising defaults. American Express fell 5.3 per cent to $38.75 after Lehman Brothers forecast net charge-offs – a measure of uncollectable debts – on its cards would reach to 8.5 per cent of loans by next year.Capital One Financial fell 5.1 per cent to $43.33 after the investment bank cut its price target from $57 to $46.The decline took in the biggest names in corporate America, such as Lehman Brothers, which dropped 10.5 per cent to $15.17 as investors worried about its ability to raise capital ahead of expected poor earnings and writedowns at the end of the month.Bank of America slipped 7.2 per cent to $30.60 as options traders placed bets it would lose almost a quarter of its value by late autumn.Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch dropped 7.5 per cent to $26.21 after reports suggested talks to sell bad loans to Korea Asset Management Corp faced a deadlock.The wider market slumped, falling for the fourth straight session after an unexpected jump in initial jobless claims and sluggish back-to-school retail sales revived concerns about the health of the economy.By the close in New York, each of the 10 industry groups were down more than 1 per cent. The S&P 500, down 3 per cent at 1,236.83, had its biggest one-day fall since early June.The Nasdaq Composite was down 3.2 per cent at 2,2259.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3 per cent lower at 11,188.23.“It’s definitely ugly, that’s for sure,” said Matt King, chief investment officer at Bell Investment Advisors.The market decline was wide-ranging and took in stocks seen as traditionally defensive. Wal-Mart was one of the only exceptions as down-trading consumers allowed the discounter to escape a retail decline.Same-store sales beat expectations, helping the shares hold steady at $59.78.The retail decline was led by TJX Companies, down 7.4 per cent at $34.07, Abercrombie & Fitch, which lost 6.8 per cent to $50.99, Limited Brands down 6.2 per cent to $20.70, and Nordstrom, down 4 per cent at $31.99.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said: “Back-to-school selling was sluggish [during] the first three weeks of August and picked up some toward the end of the month as consumers are shopping closer to need.”The downward momentum swamped news of improved productivity in the second quarter.Industrials and materials each fell more than 3 per cent. Terex, the maker of construction and mining equipment, was one of the biggest casualties, after cutting its sales and profits forecast for the year. The shares tumbled 19.7 per cent to $38.02.Caterpillar was another key laggard, down 5.6 per cent at $63.94.Steel stocks were shunned after Goldman Sachs issued a more bearish outlook on the sector in a wide-ranging sector note. It said: “A rising US dollar, ‘China fear’ and sharply falling scrap prices have shaken investor confidence in [the] sustainability of [the] steel cycle.”AK Steel shed 11.1 per cent to $40.84, Allegheny Technologies dipped 4.5 per cent to $44.18 and US Steel fell 5.1 per cent to $112.67.Technology stocks – which led Wall Street lower the previous day – endured another decline.Ciena dropped 24.9 per cent to $13.09 after the network equipment maker warned that fourth-quarter revenue would be lower than expected.Oracle fell 6 per cent to $19.93 after a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that its chief executive had failed to turn over evidence that may have proved relevant in a shareholder lawsuit against the company.Microsoft eased 2 per cent to $26.35 after saying it would cut the price of its Xbox 360 console, in the face of competition from Nintendo’s Wii and Sony’s PlayStation 3.Housebuilders were also among the casualties.Hovnanian Enterprises reported its eighth consecutive quarterly loss after nine years of gains, pushing the shares down 17.4 per cent to $6.40.

Retailers moved higher as traders looked to buy into sector weakness.Insurance companies came under pressure after American International Group dramatically increased its estimate of credit derivative losses, adding to concerns about further writedowns in the financial sector.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,339.12 having fallen 0.8 per cent early on. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,320.06 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.5 per cent to 12,240.01.Yahoo’s board formally rejected Microsoft’s $31-a-share offer as inadequate, threatening to trigger a heated takeover battle.Some analysts said the debate might now be one about price and that Yahoo might find it difficult to reject a higher offer. Microsoft is preparing to target Yahoo’s shareholders directly, the FT reported. Yahoo’s shares rose 2.3 per cent to $29.87. Microsoft fell 1.2 per cent to $28.21 after RBC Capital Markets cut its price target from $40 to $31.In a sign of further consolidation in the tech sector The Wall Street Journal said Motorola and Nortel Networks were in discussions about a possible merger of their wireless infrastructure units.

The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,382.85 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.9 per cent to 12,635.16.Wachovia and Wells Fargo were among the biggest fallers after Merrill Lynch told investors to sell the banking stocks because of their vulnerability to a worsening housing market. The shares lost 8.3 per cent to $35.53 and 6.7 per cent to $31.39, respectively. Washington Mutual, the savings and loan company, slumped 12.2 per cent to $19.16.“Trying to put a valuation on some of these financials is just really difficult when they keep coming out with these horrible earnings numbers,” said Thomas Nyheim, vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust.Separately, UBS told investors to sell shares in credit card issuers American Express, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services, citing expectations of rising credit losses in the consumer finance sector.

Traders were left wondering, however, if the gain was a temporary fillip or the start of a meaningful move higher.Among the factors driving the rally were hopes for a rescue of bond insurers which have been threatened with credit downgrades. Ambac Financial and MBIA fell 13.7 per cent to $11.39 and 5.9 per cent to $15.39, respectively, on Monday after the Financial Times reported that any rescue was unlikely to involve private equity firms as they believed the risks were too great.Traders also took profits in the technology sector after last week’s bounce triggered by Microsoft’s $44.6bn bid for Yahoo. The potential mega-merger may come in for close scrutiny after Google said the takeover could open the way for Microsoft to extend its PC monopoly to the internet.The drama probably has more acts to unfold with Yahoo insiders seeing an alliance with Google as one of their best options for fighting off Microsoft. Yahoo rose 3.4 per cent to $29.33, but Microsoft slipped 0.9 per cent to $30.19.Shares in Google closed below $500 for the first time since August, falling 4 per cent to $495.43, after Goldman Sachs removed the online search giant from a conviction “buy” list.In earnings news, Archer Daniels Midland, 2.9 per cent weaker at $44.20, increased quarterly profits to $473m from $441m, but the agricultural producer’s results narrowly missed some analysts’ estimates.Humana, the health in-surer, increased fourth-quarter profits by 57 per cent to $243.2m, beating Wall Street estimates.

Stocks floundered after Goldman Sachs said the US would fall into recession in 2008 and weak retail sales drained confidence.Although Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, tried to assure the market he was prepared to keep cutting rates to stave off a slowdown, stocks struggled to find a footing amid concerns that rate cuts may not be enough.Bank of America’s agreed takeover of Countrywide Financial, the troubled mortgage lender, helped financial stocks avoid the worst of the selling on Friday but the deal did little to stem broader market losses.Investors scrambled to find relative safety this week in pharmaceuticals, healthcare and consumer staples, considered more resistant to a recession. Telecoms and technology stocks were sold.The S&P 500 fell 1.4 per cent to 1,401.01 on Friday for a 0.8 per cent decline on the week.

The Nasdaq has fallen 14.7 per cent from its October high.“It’s becoming very moot as to whether we are in a recession. Companies are telling you, the bond market is telling you and consumers are telling you – it’s baked in,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.Financial companies were volatile after Bank of America agreed to buy Countrywide Financial for $4bn in stock. Countrywide moved the market all week amid rumours – which it denied – that it might seek bankruptcy protection.Traders were relieved that the deal saved the troubled mortgage lender from possible collapse. However, Countrywide’s shares fell 24.8 per cent to $6.33 this week, below the $7.16 per share transaction value, and BofA fell 3.4 per cent to $38.50 amid concerns over the deal. Moody’s Investors Service said it would review BofA’s credit rating for possible downgrade.In a further sign of nascent consolidation in the sector, CNBC reported that JPMorgan had held “very preliminary” takeover talks with Washington Mutual. Wamu’s shares rose 12.4 per cent to $14.69 this week.Although banks advanced on Friday amid hopes of further consolidation and more foreign capital, investors are nervous about calling a bottom in the sector.Underscoring the risks, the New York Times reported that Merrill Lynch may take a $15bn writedown in the fourth quarter. Merrill, up 8.7 per cent this week at $54.69, Citigroup, up 1.1 per cent at $28.56, and JPMorgan, 0.2 per cent weaker at $40.86, all report quarterly earnings next week.Fourth-quarter profits in the financial sector are expected to plunge 72 per cent, according to Thomson Financial, with earnings for S&P 500 down 11.3 per cent.Consumer-facing stocks were sold off on Friday after American Express said it would take a $440m fourth-quarter charge to cover rising delinquencies and gave a cautious outlook for this year. American Express’s warning came after Capital One Financial, the card issuer, cut its full-year profit guidance by more than 20 per cent. The shares fell 10.5 per cent to $44 and 7.4 per cent to $42.59, respectively.Economists have long feared mortgage-related losses would spread into the broader economy as consumers unable to make home payments default on loans. AmEx’s warning was particularly worrisome as its high-end clients were considered more resistant to a consumer slowdown.Tiffany & Co added to these worries after the luxury jeweller cut the upper end of its fiscal-year earnings outlook, causing it to sink 13.5 per cent to $35.80 for the period. The news capped a poor week for US retailers after some poor same-store sales from mid-market clothing chains. Gap fell 12.5 per cent to $17.20 this week.Wall Street hopes aggressive Fed action will help prevent the US economy from tipping into recession. However, stocks managed only a mute rally after a speech by Mr Bernanke on Thursday opened the door to further rate cuts.While the domestic economy is seen weakening, some analysts argue US multinationals will suffer less from a downturn because so much of their revenues are overseas. The weaker dollar has also provided a boon for exporters. Coca-Cola fell sharply on Friday but rose 3.1 per cent to $63.77 over the week.Telecoms also sold off after AT&T warned of a slowdown in its domestic consumer business. Shares lost 6.6 per cent to $38.20.However, biotechnology firms continued to outpeform. Biogen Idec put on 6.9 per cent to $59.02 for the week after it delivered upbeat profit guidance.

Earnings for the fourth quarter, due out on 23 January, are expected to be 60 cents a share, including a 25 cents a share loss from the closure of its GreenPoint Mortgage unit in August.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.51 a for the fourth quarter and $4.98 for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Net income was $391m, or $1.14 a share, in the final quarter of 2006.As house prices fall and foreclosures and late payments on mortgages rise, concern has mounted that troubles in the housing markets will spill over into other areas of consumer debt such as credit cards and auto loans. Rising unemployment, which jumped to 5 per cent from 4.7 per cent last month, may also cut into consumer’s ability to pay off debts.Capital One’s warning was driven by increased loan loss provisions, amid mounting delinquencies on credit card loans, and legal reserves set up in the fourth quarter to deal with an antitrust case against Visa.The group expects to set aside about $1.9bn for loan losses in the quarter, including $1.3bn in charge-offs, or bad debt that has to be written off from credit cards and auto loans. Delinquencies and charge-offs rose during the quarter. Charge-offs for the year are now set to hit $5.9bn, against previous company forecasts of $4.9bn-$5.5bn.The loss provision includes $650m for delinquent loans, “continued deterioration” in the $700m in home equity lines of credit originated by GreenPoint and expectations of a weaker US economy in 2008.GreenPoint specialised in providing loans to subprime borrowers and so-called ”Alt-A ”, or near-prime borrowers, which it would then sell on to investors. It was forced to close after investors appetite for securities backed by mortgages collapsed.Moody’s, the rating agency, maintained its credit rating for the company but said it had noted “the recent trend of deterioration in asset quality in Capital One’s consumer businesses (and in the US consumer finance industry in general) and the expectation that such deterioration will continue into 2008.”Countrywide, the biggest US mortgage lender, also said on Wednesday that foreclosures and late payments rose the most in five years last month.Capital One said it also faced legal expenses of about $140m before tax in connection with the settlement of a Visa antitrust lawsuit with American Express, and in anticipation of future damages claims from other Visa lawsuits.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.9 per cent to 12,853.09 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,488.52.Mr Bernanke said the Fed might take “substantive” action on rates, leading traders to believe the Fed could ease by 50 basis points at the end of this month.“What this did is it indicate the Fed is not going to get caught behind the curve,” Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said.Many traders have already priced in further rate cuts amid the threat of a looming recession. After the Fed chairman’s comments the futures market factored in a 90 per cent chance of a 50bp cut at the end of this month, with at least two further 25bp cuts seen likely.The financial sector rallied further before the close on reports that Countrywide Financial, the struggling mortgage lender, was in advance talks with Bank of America about a possible merger. Countrywide’s shares soared 51.4 per cent to $7.75.The S&P financial sector climbed as much as 6 per cent off its session-low.

Homebuilders also rebounded with the S&P homebuilder index closing 6.2 per cent higher at 305.05.Blackstone made gains after the private equity group agreed to acquire GSO Capital Partners for up to $930m. Blackstone also announced a $500m stock buy-back programme and the shares rose 9.6 per cent to $19.84.Earlier a profit warning at Capital One Financial had unsettled traders. The credit card company cut its full-year profit guidance by more than 20 per cent because of rising loan delinquencies. The shares closed down 1 per cent at $42.92.After the closing bell American Express reported similar problems. The card issuer said it would take a $440m charge for the fourth quarter as more customers have missed payments. It also gave a cautious outlook for 2008.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 13,167.20.

The Russell 2000 small-cap index, down 2 per cent at 745.11, has fallen 6.2 per cent this year.Although buyout firms have been hit by the tightening in credit markets, many companies remain flush with cash, as the popularity of share buybacks illustrates.Shares in Harley Davidson rose 1.5 per cent to $45.62, after the motorcycle group approved the repurchase of up to 20m shares.Investors were keeping an eye on the leading investment banks amid fears of further writedowns.Goldman Sachs, down 1 per cent at $208.63, reports quarterly results on Tuesday while Morgan Stanley, down 1.5 per cent at $49.53, releases fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow with Bear Stearns, 1.3 per cent weaker at $94.07, set to follow on Thursday.Citigroup on Monday downgraded a range of consumer finance companies, including Capital One Financial, the credit card provider.

The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell to 3.41 per cent, its lowest level since February 2005.“Treasuries are strictly in flight-to-quality mode, and investors are waiting for the next shoe to drop,” said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley. “This is round two and there will probably be a round three.”Rate cut expectations helped push the dollar index to a record low of 74.978. The dollar set a fresh low of $1.4752 versus the euro and fell to Y110.52 against the yen.The turmoil was fuelled by mounting credit turmoil. Fire sales of mortgage assets from complex debt vehicles began in earnest after the trustee of a $1.5bn complex debt deal managed by State Street Global Advisors started liquidating its portfolio.Ratings downgrades for mortgage securities have pushed a clutch of such deals into default. Trustees have issued default notices for more than 14 collateralised debt obligation deals in recent weeks, representing securities with a face value of more than $10bn.A default means the most senior investors in the CDO can liquidate the underlying assets to get their money back. Analysts say more deals are on the brink of default.Wachovia, fourth-largest US bank, estimated that the value of its sub-prime mortgage securities fell $1.1bn in October and said it was increasing loan loss provisions because of “dramatic declines” in house prices in some parts of the US.Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase also warned in a regulatory filings that they could face further writedowns in the fourth quarter.Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage company, said its third-quarter loss doubled to $1.52bn. Capital One, the leading credit card issuer, said more customers had difficulty paying their bills in October than in the third quarter.
144;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

An index of large-cap technology stocks posted its worst weekly performance in more than five years.Credit market jitters flared after big writedowns and rising loan-loss provisions at financial companies. The automotive sector suffered after General Motors posted the second largest quarterly loss in US corporate history.The S&P 500 closed down 1.7 per cent Friday at 1,453.70, its lowest in two months and 3 per cent lower for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.4 per cent on the week at 13,042.74 points.Both indices fell below their 200-day moving averages this week, commonly viewed as a bearish indicator, and have erased all their gains since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in mid-September.“For all the rampant bullish talk from ‘containment’ to ‘resilience’ to ‘decoupling’, 75 basis points of Fed easing have done absolutely nothing for the stock market,” said David Rosenberg, chief US economist at Merrill Lynch.Consumer staples and utilities fared best as investors sought safety in recession-resistant stocks. The CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer – spiked 23.7 per cent to 28.48 on the week, a level last reached at the height of the summer credit squeeze.The most significant losses were in the tech sector. The Nasdaq Composite was 5.8 per cent lower on the week at 2,627.94. Large-cap tech stocks, previously considered safe havens by investors, fell even more. The Nasdaq 100 shed 6.8 per cent to 2,034.30, its worst weekly sell-off since April 2002.“The breadth of this year’s rally in tech has been narrow, only 25 per cent of tech companies have outperformed the index,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment strategist at Harris Private Bank. “If the economy really slows down and inflation picks up, this is a group of sitting ducks.”The slide in tech stocks was sparked by Cisco Systems, whose chief executive said “dramatic year-on-year decreases in orders” from big banks could slow growth. Its stock fell 12.1 per cent at $28.58 on the week.Investors view Cisco as a bellwether for the technology sector and the comments sparked a big sell-off.Cognizant Technology Solutions shed 24.7 per cent at $32.75 after its fourth-quarter revenue guidance missed expectations. Oracle fell 12.1 per cent at $19.36, Apple was down 12 per cent at $165.37 and Google fell below $700, down 6.6 per cent at $663.97.Financials had another highly volatile week. Morgan Stanley, down 8 per cent at $54.20, declared a $3.7bn loss on subprime mortgage-linked securities.Wachovia lost 5.1 per cent on the week at $40.65. It said its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations – securities linked to the troubled mortgage market – had lost $1.1bn in value during October. American International Group’s quarterly earnings declined 27 per cent and the shares fell 3.6 per cent on the week at $57.02.Washington Mutual fell 13.9 per cent at $20.51 after it increased its credit loss provision to $1.3bn this quarter and forecast mortgage lending would plunge next year. Citigroup declined 11.7 per cent to $33.10 on the week. Its shares had fallen for eight days before a modest rally Friday.Capital One Financial, the biggest US credit card issuer, fell 11.3 per cent to $54.26 after it said writedowns on bad credit card debt could reach the “mid-$5bn” range. American Express fell 3.3 per cent at $56.49.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – the government-chartered companies that own or guarantee about 40 per cent of US mortgages – declined 6.9 per cent to $49 and 13.7 per cent to $41.70, respectively. Both companies were subpoenaed by the New York attorney-general, who has widened his inquiry into the US mortgage industry.General Motors and Ford Motor shed 15.5 per cent at $31.28 and 8.4 per cent at $8.20 respectively on the week. GM reported a $39bn loss after taking a non-cash charge against future tax benefits.Retailers dipped after disappointing October sales data. Wal-Mart declined 2.9 per cent on the week at $42.90.

146;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2007-11-08T00:07:21Z;Stocks tumble as oil, inflation fears mount;;US stocks tumbled on Wednesday as the dollar hit record lows and mounting mortgage losses raised fears that credit turmoil could damage economic growth.The combination of events left investors worried about whether the Federal Reserve would be able to cut rates in response to the credit turmoil without further weakening the dollar or igniting inflation and pushing oil prices even higher.Stocks suffered, with the S&P 500 falling 2.9 per cent to give up all its gains since the Fed began cutting rates on September 18. The S&P financials index was more than 20 per cent off its high in February. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 1.39 per cent“The Fed is caught between a rock and a hard place as the dollar weakens and the economy faces headwinds from higher oil prices and financials tightening credit standards,” said Gerald Lucas, at Deutsche Bank.Fears about the health of big banks grew as Washington Mutual, the biggest savings and loan, and Capital One, a leading credit card issuer, increased reserves to cover expected loan losses. WaMu shares fell 17.4 per cent, while Capital One was off 15.2 per cent.“The soft landing we were anticipating quickly transitioned to a severe downturn,” said Kerry Killinger, chief executive at Washington Mutual. “This process is painful.”The dollar sank against sterling and the euro after a top Chinese official said the country’s $1,430bn foreign exchange reserves should be diversified away from the dollar into strong currencies such as the euro.The euro climbed to $1.47 for the first time, hitting a peak of $1.4730, while sterling reached a 26-year high of $2.1070.“It puts the Fed in the box over cutting rates,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “How do you cut rates to save the financials when the dollar is getting killed? That’s the crux of the whole matter.”The White House said oil prices were “too high” as West Texas Intermediate crude, the global benchmark, rose to a nominal record of $98.62 a barrel – up almost 60 per cent since January – propelled by the weakness of the dollar and the belief that US inventories would prove to be tight. The crude rally stalled and prices fell later in the day as data showed US oil inventories declined less than feared last week.Expectations of future inflation rates, as measured by Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, approached their highest levels of the year. Gold hit a 28-year high of $845.40 an ounce, near its all-time high of $850.Simon Derrick, analyst at Bank of New York Mellon, said: “Concerns among investors are clearly growing about rising inflation globally and in the US in particular.”Additional reporting, Ed Crooks and Chris Flood in London
147;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2007-11-07T22:05:55Z;Wall St hit by GM losses and credit fears;;US stocks suffered heavy losses on Wednesday after the dollar slumped to new lows, General Motors posted a massive loss and New York’s attorney general widened an investigation into the US home loan industry.Credit-market fears again shook equities after financial companies warned that loan losses will mount as delinquencies rise next year.The S&P 500 plummeted 2.9 per cent at 1,475.63. The index has now erased all its gains since the Federal Reserve cut rates in mid-Setepmber.The Nasdaq Composite slid 2.7 per cent at 2,748.76 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.6 per cent at 13,300.02, a fall of more than 360 points.Transport stocks were particularly hard hit after crude oil hit $98 a barrel before the price retreated later in the session. The Dow transport index declined 3.2 per cent at 4663.35.Consumer staples and healthcare stocks outperformed the market while financials lagged and energy and materials stocks were sold down.Volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index spiked 24.2 per cent higher to 26.57 .Bearish sentiment was also evident in the short selling of NYSE-listed stocks, which increased 2.4 per cent to 11.93bn shares at the end of last month. However short interest remains below a high of 12.95bn reached in mid-July.Corporate news was dominated by General Motor’s $39bn third-quarter loss, the second-worst in US corporate history, after it took a $38.6bn non-cash charge against future tax benefits and incurred big losses from a home-loan affiliate.GM shares fell 6.1 per cent at $33.95. Ford, which reports third-quarter earnings on Thursday, declined 4.5 per cent to $8.24.Washington Mutual slumped 17.3 per cent to $20.04 after it warned that mortgage lending would decline to an eight-year low next year, more than the industry had forecast. It also expects to set aside as much as $1.3bn this quarter to cover bad loans, and a similar amount in the first quarter of 2008.But the group’s shares extended losses after Andrew Cuomo, New York’s attorney-general, subpoenaed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac seeking information on loans they bought from banks, including Washington Mutual, and details of their due diligence practices.Fannie and Freddie – the government-chartered companies that own or guarantee about 40 per cent of US mortgages – fell 10.1 per cent to $49.79 and 8.6 per cent to $45.13 respectively.Other mortgage-related companies suffered big declines.IndyMac Bancorp declined 11.3 per cent to $11.08 after Friedman Billings Ramsey downgraded the mortgage lender. Countrywide Financial fell 9.4 per cent at $13.63.Capital One Financial, the biggest US credit card issuer, fell 15.5 per cent to a four-year low of $50.21 after it raised its 2008 bad debt forecast.

Its shares declined 2.9 per cent at $15.84..But Expedia, up 1.6 per cent at $30.65, beat expectations as third-quarter earnings rose 69 per cent to $99.6m on revenues that increased 24 per cent.After the closing bell Cisco said quarterly profit rose to $2.2bn from $1.6bn while revenue rose 16.7 per cent to $9.6bn. Its shares were down 3.9 per cent on the day at $32.75 and declined further in after hours trade.News Corp, down 3 per cent at $21.96 on the day, also announced results after the market closed. It reported fiscal first quarter net income of $732m, beating analysts’ expectations.
148;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2007-11-07T20:16:28Z;Consumer lenders suffer big falls;;Stocks of consumer lending businesses plummeted on Wednesday, as some of the largest US mortgage and credit card lenders set aside increased reserves for bad loans amid ongoing deterioration in the US housing market.Investors punished shares of Washington Mutual, the largest US savings and loan institution, and Capital One, the biggest US credit card issuer, as both companies said the US housing downturn would put borrowers under pressure to pay back their debts.WaMu said on Wednesday the US housing slump would persist throughout 2008, causing losses to mount and mortgage lending to fall to an eight-year low.“The soft landing we were anticipating quickly transitioned to a severe downturn,” said Kerry Killinger, chief executive at Washington Mutual. “This process is painful.”The mortgage lender said it would set aside $1.3bn this quarter for credit losses, up from $967m in the third quarter. WaMu expects mortgage lending to drop to $1,500bn in 2008 from an estimated $2,300bn in 2007. Shares in the company plunged by nearly 13 per cent to their lowest level since August 2000.Shares in Capital One also fell by 7 per cent after the company raised its 2008 loss provisions for bad credit card and mortgage debts, the latest in a series of signs that problems in the subprime mortgage market are beginning to seep into other types of consumer debt.Capital One said in a regulatory filing late on Tuesday that write-offs on bad consumer debts may range from $4.9bn to “the mid $5-billions”.The company said the increased loan reserves were needed to account for the possibility of significant deterioration in the housing market, increased late payments and defaults on credit cards, and ongoing losses in its mortgage portfolio. Capital One closed its Greenpoint mortgage business earlier this year.Richard Hofmann, analyst at research group CreditSights, said: “There could be more meaningful deterioration brewing as the company in our view represents a data point of subprime mortgage weakness spreading to other lending sectors.”Stocks of the government-sponsored mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also tumbled on Wednesday after Andrew Cuomo, New York State attorney-general said in a statement that his office had sent subpoenas to the two companies as part of his investigation into the mortgage industry.Mr Cuomo last week sued the real estate appraisal unit of First American, the biggest US title insurer, accusing it of inflating home values under pressure from WaMu.
149;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2007-10-11T02:59:37Z;Fund settles with SEC over Katrina;;"Sandell Asset Management has reached an $8m settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it improperly made short sales that were designed to benefit from the turmoil following Hurricane Katrina.The settlement followed an SEC investigation into the New York hedge fund group; Thomas Sandell, its chief executive officer; and two other employees for allegedly engaging in improper short sales in connection with trading in the securities of Hibernia in the aftermath of Katrina.Sandell and its top executives agreed to pay more than $8m to settle the charges, although neither the firm nor its personnel admitted or denied wrongdoing.The settlement included a civil fine of $650,000 for the firm, and a penalty of $190,000 for top executives, including Mr Sandell, a former Bear Stearns risk arbitrage specialist.Hibernia, a New Orleans-based bank holding company, was the subject of an acquisition agreement with Capital One Financial at the time of Katrina.As part of its merger arbitrage investment strategy, SAM held a large long position in Hibernia. According to the SEC’s order, Sandell personnel believed Capital One would lower its offering price for Hibernia shares in the wake of Katrina.In an attempt to offload the anticipated loss to a client, the SEC said Sandell personnel began to sell short as many shares of Hibernia stock as possible, improperly marking certain sales orders as “long” or misrepresenting to the broker-dealers executing some of the trades that they had located stock to borrow.“This action is part of our ongoing effort to ensure that hedge funds comply with the federal securities laws, including all applicable trading rules,” said Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement.Scott Friestad, associate director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, added: “This settlement deprives the firm of the profits made from the improper trading, and includes penalties and other sanctions designed to deter others from engaging in similar misconduct.”"
150;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2007-08-27T19:30:37Z;Internet groups brace for subprime fallout;;Internet companies are bracing for a possible fall-off in one of their biggest sources of advertising following the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market.Besides mortgage advertising specifically directed at less credit-worthy borrowers, the ripples from the financial upheaval could extend to other forms of credit as well as the credit scoring agencies that are also big advertisers online, analysts warned.Pricing could also be hurt more broadly on some classes of advertising on web search engines, because fewer advertisers are expected to be competing in the advertising auctions run by companies such as Google to have their messages displayed next to specific keywords.“A lot of the subprime [advertising] has gone away,” said David Jakubowski, general manager of Microsoft’s MSN service.This loss had yet to have a broader effect in the search business, he added.“I haven’t felt a pricing hit because of it,” he said. “We haven’t seen anything crazy happen,” though he added that the company continued to keep a close eye on this area for more fallout.Many online companies depend for a disproportionate amount of their income on financial services advertising, with subprime in some cases accounting for a large part of it.Sixteen per cent of all online advertising comes from financial services companies, making it the second biggest source of advertising behind the retailing sector, said Sandeep Aggarwal, an internet analyst at Oppenheimer.Companies that lent to subprime borrowers relied heavily on the internet to attract customers, concentrating the effect of the meltdown, said Rick Sizemore, an analyst at Multimedia Intelligence.According to data from Nielsen/NetRatings, mortgage lenders Countrywide and Low Rate Source were two of the 10 biggest online advertisers in the US in July.Experian Group and Privacy Matters, which advertise to consumers who are concerned about their personal credit scores, also numbered among the top 10.Others, such as Lending Tree, the mortgage company, and Capital One, the credit card group, regularly rank among the biggest US advertisers on the web.
151;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2007-08-21T20:38:25Z;Wall St unconvinced by Bush reassurances;;Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday, in spite of assurances from Christopher Dodd, head of the US Senate banking committee, that Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, had agreed to use “all of the tools at his disposal’’ to stabilise financial markets and from President George W. Bush that there was “enough liquidity in the system”.A cautious afternoon rally followed early losses on comments by Henry Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary, who said he saw no quick solution to problems in the credit markets.Mr Dodd’s remark came after he met Mr Paulson and Mr Bernanke to discuss the markets’ recent turbulence.Last week the Fed cut its overnight discount rate by 50 basis points. While that initially gave markets a boost, the rally ran out of steam on Monday.The S&P 500 finished the day up 0.1 per cent at 1,447.12, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent at 2,521.30, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower at 13,090.86.There were signs that traders were shopping for bargains. Confidence among global institutional investors rose in August despite volatility on financial markets, according to a study by State Street, the financial services firm.Credit Suisse said markets presented buying opportunities. “There has been more of a liquidity crisis than an economic or valuation crisis in the stock market,” said analysts at the financial services group, adding that “relative valuations have become much more attractive”. But they also cautioned that there may not be a simple V-shaped recovery.More evidence of the pain in the housing market came yesterday from a report showing foreclosure filings — such as default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions — almost doubled last month from a year ago. In total, 179,599 foreclosure filings were reported during July, up from 92,845 in 2006, according to RealtyTrac, a research firm.Countrywide Financial, which has seen its stock price fall by 30 per cent in recent days, was in the spotlight again after speculation that the US’s biggest mortgage lender could be a buy-out target for Warren Buffett. Shares in the beleaguered mortgage giant rose 10 per cent to $21.79.Another mortgage lender grabbing traders’ attention was Accredited Home Lenders. The subprime lender said yesterday an unnamed investor had agreed to buy $1bn of loans with the option for Accredited to buy back the loans before mid-November. The news came after lawyers for Lone Star, the buy-out group, said problems at Accredited justified its withdrawal from a proposed $400m purchase of the company and said Accredited had no grounds for its lawsuit to force completion of the merger. The company’s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $6.55.A string of retailers reported quarterly earnings. Shares in Target closed up 1.7 per cent at $60.10 after the discount retailer reported second quarter earnings in line with expectations. Staples reported second-quarter profits in line with Wall Street projections but said sales slipped in its North American stores that have been open for more than a year. Issuing a cautious forecast for the rest of the year, Ron Sargent, chief executive, said he was worried about consumer spending. Shares in the US’s biggest office-supplies retailer lost 0.04 per cent to $23.30.Among other retailers, American Eagle reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. The youth fashion retailer’s shares closed down 0.9 per cent at $22.81, but S&P reiterated its “strong buy” recommendation on the stock. Dick’s Sporting Goods reported second-quarter profits well ahead of expectations, with earnings up 87 per cent to $47.9m from $25.7m a year ago. The retailer’s shares rose 8.7 per cent to $60.43. Saks reported a bigger loss for the second quarter than analysts had been expecting – $24.6m, up from a loss of $51.9m a year earlier. Its shares closed down 6.2 per cent at $16.83.In technology, shares in LSI rose 7.1 per cent to $6.62 after Infineon Technologies, Europe’s second-biggest semiconductor-maker, agreed to buy its mobility products group for about $445m. Apple rose 4.4 per cent to $127.57 after the company said sales of its iPhone could beat its own targets for the quarter.
152;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2007-08-20T22:15:11Z;Capital One and Thornburg lose $1.8bn;;The US mortgage meltdown continued to spread on Monday as two big lenders announced expected losses of a combined $1.8bn.Capital One Financial, one of the largest US credit card providers, said it would close its wholesale home lending unit, GreenPoint Mortgage, and take an after-tax charge of $860m, most of it coming this year.Capital One said it would reduce its 2007 earnings guidance by $2.15 to $5.00 per share and would eliminate 1,900 jobs.Meanwhile, Thornburg Mortgage, which provides big mortgages on expensive properties, said it would record a $930m third quarter loss on the sale of mortgage-backed bonds.In an internal memo, Rich Fairbank, Capital One chief executive, said the company’s decision to close GreenPoint came in response to “unprecedented disruption in the secondary mortgage markets”.GreenPoint specialised in providing loans to subprime borrowers and so-called “Alt-A”, or near prime borrowers. GreenPoint would then sell those mortgages on to investors.However, defaults among subprime borrowers have soared in recent months and the appetite among investors for securities backed by mortgages has plunged.”The reductions in demand and pricing in the secondary mortgage markets make it difficult to operate our wholesale mortgage banking business profitably,” said Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer, in a statement.He added, ”Beyond that, Capital One’s other businesses are supported by ample liquidity and funding including deep access to deposits, a ‘stockpile’ of subordinated credit card funding in place that allows approximately $9bn of AAA credit card funding going forward, and a $25bn portfolio of highly liquid securities.”Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, acquired GreenPoint as part of its 2006 purchase of North Fork, the New York bank. GreenPoint was known to offer “no doc” mortgages that provided credit even if borrowers did not provide documentation of their ability to pay.The move by Capital One and the announcement from Thornburg come after Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, last week said it would tap into an $11.5bn credit line to fund operations after the global credit squeeze curtailed its ability to raise funds in the debt market.But on Monday Countrywide, which employs more than 61,500 across the US, took out full page advertisements in the New York Times and other newspapers saying it was “well capitalised”. These came after some reports suggested the lender had begun to lay workers off.Partly in response to Countrywide, the US Federal Reserve said it was cutting in half the interest rate penalty on its discount window, allowing banks to borrow directly from the Fed against a wide range of collateral, including most mortgages, at only 50 basis points above the federal funds rate.
153;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2007-06-28T22:10:50Z;Upgrades for Intel and Cisco offset warnings;;"Wall Street was mixed on Thursday, and choppy trade ensued after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and warned that inflation remains a source of concern.Earnings warnings for several stocks were offset in part by upgrades for the likes of Intel and Cisco, which provided a boost for the technology sector.Airline stocks were also higher after JPMorgan upgraded six airlines and said valuations were low given the outlook for consolidation in 2008.Meanwhile, homebuilders were lower after swung to a loss in the fiscal second quarter as the homebuilder wrote down inventory in the face of weakening demand for new homes. Shares in KB fell 1.3 per cent to $39.89. The S&P homebuilder index was 1.7 per cent lower amid further losses among companies in the sector.The S&P closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,505.71 points, after it rose to a high of 1,514.84 after the Federal Open Market Committee statement was released. Financials, utility and energy sectors closed lower yesterday.The FOMC said the economy grew at a moderate rate during the first half of this year, despite “the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector.” In terms of inflation risk, policy makers said core inflation was no longer “elevated” but that “a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.”“A Fed that describes the economy and inflation in friendlier terms than before is generally treated bullishly in the markets, particularly the stock market,” said Tony Crescenzi, strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. He said a lakcluster response from stocks likely indicated “further evidence of the depth to which fears about credit conditions have increased.”Amid investor worries about how troubles in the US mortgage market would play out across structured credit markets, the FOMC did not specifically address the US mortgage market.Equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, ebbed further yesterday, but rose from its low after the FOMC. The Vix was 0.4 per cent lower at 15.47 after a 17.9 per cent decline from a three-month peak on Wednesday.Technology was in the spotlight yesterday and the asdaq Composite led the broad benchmarks during the day and closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,608.37.Brokerage upgrades for Intel, up 0.6 per cent at $23.92, and Cisco Systems, up 2.1 per cent at $27.85, boosted technology stocks.Also helping the sector was a 1.8 per cent rise to $28.45 in Dell. Amazon rose 1.1 per cent at $68.89, taking its gain for the year to 76.5 per cent.RBC Capital Markets raised its price target for the online retailer from $45 to $75 and said high levels of short interest and a concentration in holdings would limit any selling pressure in the stock.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.4 per cent lower at 13,422.28. A birght spot for bluechips was General Motors, up
2 per cent at $38.15 with shares reaching their highest level in over two years. The carmaker agreed to sell its Allison Transmission commercial and military business for about $5.6bn to the Carlyle Group and Onex Corp, two private equity firms.One sector in the news on Thursday was airlines.The American stock exchange airline index gained 2 per cent, trimming
its loss for the year to
14.1 per cent. JPMorgan’s upgrade for six carriers helped boost UAL Corp, up 4.3 per cent to $40.63, while Continental was 2.7 per cent higher at $34.09.Shares in Sprint fell 2.3 per cent to $21.13 after Citigroup downgraded the telecommunications stock to a hold because of concern that the company’s restructuring would face headwinds from slower industry growth and the launch of Apple’s iPhone.Shares in Apple fell 1.1 per cent to $121.56.After the closing bell, Research in Motion said fiscal first quarter earnings rose 73 per cent amid strong sales of its BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices. The company also announced a three-for-one stock split and shares rose more than 10 per cent in after-hours trade.Second-quarter earnings warnings were issued by Novellus Systems, down 3.4 per cent at $28.89, and LSI Logic, off 11.5 per cent at $7.65. Shares in Bed Bath & Beyond fell 3.9 per cent to $36.09 after the retailer issued first-quarter earnings in line with forecasts and cautious guidance.Digital River fell 11.9 per cent to $45 after the e-commerce outsourcer cut its second-quarter and full-year forecasts.Blackstone fell 0.8 per cent to $29.69, extending its losses below its recent $31 listing price.Shares in Dillard’s jumped 8.1 per cent to $36.69 as Barington Capital Group, an activist investment group that represents minority shareholders, said it wanted to meet the retailer’s management and find ways to boost the stock price."
154;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2006-12-28T21:32:38Z;JC Penney COO fired after six months;;JC Penney, the US department store chain, on Thursday announced that it had sacked its chief operating officer, Catherine West, just six months after she was appointed.A company statement said Myron Ullman, chief executive, had terminated Ms West “effective immediately” but gave no reason for the move. She joined the retailer in July from Capital One, where she was president of its US card business.Darcie Brossart, JC Penney’s spokeswoman, said Mr Ullman would resume control of store operations, property development and logistics, and that the transition was expected to be “seamless”.Howard Davidowitz, of retail consultants Davidowitz & Associates, noted that Ms West had been Mr Ullman’s “biggest hire” since he became chief executive of JC Penney over two years ago. “Something must have happened, and it can’t be good,” he said.Ms West would have played a leading role in JC Penney’s expansion plans, following the completion of a turnround that has seen the once-struggling retailer reinvent itself as a purveyor of “cheap chic” to middle America.The retailer, which had sales this year of around $19bn, has announced plans to open 50 stores a year in the coming two years, with a heavy emphasis on large free-standing stores, in place of the mall-based stores that make up the bulk of its existing 1,000 store network.The West departure is follows the high drama of two years ago, when the board appointed Mr Ullman, who previously worked for LVMH, was appointed chief executive over the head of Vanessa Castagna, then chief of the company’s stores division.Ms Castagna subsequently left, and is now heading a turnround at Mervyn’s, a West Coast discount chain now owned by private equity investors led by Cerberus Capital.JC Penney’s shares have risen over 40 per cent so far this year, with the company reporting sales growth that is above the rest of the sector.

155;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2006-03-30T20:37:37Z;BoNY and JPMorgan in banking talks;;Bank of New York, the oldest bank in the US, is in talks to dispose of most of its banking arm to JPMorgan Chase, in order to focus on its larger securities processing business.The move would bolster JPMorgan’s market-leading position in retail banking in New York City and, more importantly, in surrounding suburban areas.The deal could involve Bank of New York swapping its retail bank, which analysts value at more than $4bn, for some of JPMorgan’s securities services arm to avoid a big capital gains tax hit.Bank of New York has long been expected to sell its retail arm to concentrate on securities processing, where it is one of the world’s leading suppliers, and investment management.Speculation increased in recent weeks following Capital One’s $14.6bn acquisition of North Fork Bancorp which highlighted the value of banks in the New York area. Bank of New York, which was founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, Treasury secretary in George Washington’s first cabinet, has struggled to grow its retail bank in recent years, marring a good performance from its processing business.The shares were up 4 per cent at $35.78 at noon in New York, valuing it at more than $27bn, following a report of the talks on CNBC. JPMorgan is the retail banking market leader in New York City, but is weaker in suburban areas in New Jersey and Connecticut where Bank of New York has most of its 342 branches.The New York market is competitive, with Bank of America and Wachovia investing in new branches to compete with JPMorgan, Citigroup, HSBC and regional banks, including Bank of New York, North Fork and Commerce. Despite despite the competition, the leading banks make good returns.Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive, has made clear his determination to protect its position as market leader. Bank of New York’s business, with 600,000 retail customers and 100,000 small and medium-sized business clients, is worth about $4bn, according to Mike Mayo, a Prudential Financial analyst, based on 13 times 2006 earnings of $293m. It had deposits of $15.7bn at end 2005 or about 3 per cent of the New York total.

After racking up three consecutive days of gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its advance yesterday, rising 0.2 per cent to close at 11,279.65.The S&P 500, which broke through the 1,300 mark on Wednesday for the first time since May 2001, edged up another 0.2 per cent to 1,307.25 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to settle at 2,306.48.This took the weekly gain for the Dow to 1.8 per cent, for the S&P to 2 per cent and for the Nasdaq to 2 per cent.The week produced record quarterly figures from Wall Street’s top investment banks, which defied expectations that their trading businesses would suffer as US short-term interest rates increased.Goldman Sachs set the bar for its peers on Tuesday as it delivered first-quarter net profits 50 per cent ahead of analyst forecasts.The stellar performance was followed by Lehman Brothers, which unveiled a 24 per cent jump in quarterly earnings and Bear Stearns, which reported a
34 per cent earnings increase on the back of strong performances in trading, derivatives, investment banking and wealth management.Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein Research, said he expected merchant banking “to remain an exceptional business in 2006”.Goldman Sachs ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $150.36, while Lehman and Bear Stearns inched up 0.5 per cent to $142.80 and 0.5 per cent to $132.87 respectively, having seen their gains pared by profit-taking.Investment banks were not the only ones doing brisk business. Charles Schwab shot up 11 per cent to $18.13 after the discount broker issued a bullish first-quarter forecast, saying client trade was up 52 per cent last month, compared with the same period a year before.Railroad stocks also chugged ahead after Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, raised first-quarter profit guidance by 20 per cent, and CSX, the third-
biggest, was upgraded by analysts at UBS.Separately, Merrill Lynch raised its price estimates on Union and four other rail companies, saying railroads had benefited from increased shipping of commodities such as coal.The Dow Jones transportation index gained 2.2 per cent for the week. The S&P railroads index jumped 6.2 per cent, led by Union, up 6.2 per cent to $91.07 and CSX, up 7.6 per cent to $59.46.Energy stocks had a lacklustre start to the week, thanks to data which revealed rising crude inventory levels in the US. However, that news was overshadowed by mounting tensions in Iraq.The announcement by the US military of the start of “Operation Swarmer” – the largest aerial bombing campaign since the 2003 invasion – saw traders rush to cover short positions.Heavyweight oil stocks felt the benefit of heightened worries over the sustainability of crude supplies, with ExxonMobil climbing 3.2 per cent to $61.05, Chevron up 5.7 per cent to $57.18 and Marathon Oil putting on
9.9 per cent to $76.36.The upswing in crude prices weighed on chipmakers. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which tumbled 3.2 per cent on Thursday, ended the week with a loss of 1.2 per cent. Advanced Micro Devices led the way with a 7.3 per cent fall to $33.95 as investors exited the sector to jump on the energy bandwagon.Merrill Lynch said it believed investors were factoring in the reality that there was little additional volume growth upside or margin leverage left in the semiconductor sector.North Fork Bancorp climbed 14.8 per cent to $29.10 after credit card issuer Capital One Financial said it had agreed to buy the company in a $14.6bn cash-and-shares deal. Calyon Securities said the deal came as a surprise, but it was a good acquisition at a reasonable price. Shares in Capital One fell 8.9 per cent to $81.90.General Motors, which tumbled nearly 5 per cent yesterday after announcing 2005 losses were $2bn deeper than previously thought, ended the week 2.4 per cent lower at $21.13."
157;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2006-03-13T21:19:06Z;Bid activity supports Wall Street;;Shares on Wall Street advanced on Monday amid a fresh wave of merger and acquisition activity.With no major economic data or corporate earnings news on the calendar, a number of bid approaches combined to boost investors’ sentiment.The S&P 500 closed 0.2 per cent higher at 1,284.13 while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.2 per cent to 2,267.03. However, the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 11,076.02.Shares in North Fork Bancorp rose 15 per cent to $29.20 after credit card issuer Capital One Financial said it had agreed to buy the company in a $14.6bn cash and stock deal.Calyon Securities maintained its “add” rating on Capital One, saying that while the deal came as a surprise, it was a good acquisition at a reasonable price. “We also think it does a lot to further the company’s transformation into a traditional banking business,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Calyon.Shares in Capital One fell 7.6 per cent to $83.10.Elsewhere, newspaper publisher McClatchy slipped 2.9 per cent to $51.55 after saying it would acquire Knight Ridder, its larger rival, in a cash and stock deal worth $4.5bn. Knight Ridder eased 1.7 per cent lower to $63.92.Analysts at Merrill Lynch noted McClatchy shares had moved up on Friday as it became clear the company was the frontrunner to acquire Knight Ridder. “This leads us to believe that some of the more risk adverse money had already bolted the shares,” they said. “We believe the deal would be attractive financially to McClatchy.”The telecommunications sector was also in focus on reports that Verizon had made an initial approach to Vodafone for its 45 per cent stake in the companies’ Verizon Wireless joint venture.Verizon rose 0.4 per cent to $34.32, while Vodafone put on 4.8 per cent to $22.56.Shares in the Nasdaq Stock Market eased 0.6 per cent to $43.30 after jumping more than 10 per cent on Friday following its $4.2bn bid for the London Stock Exchange. The bid was rejected as too low, but few people were predicting the end of the affair, with the NYSE Group, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, up 9.3 per cent to $81.49, predicted to enter the fray.Watson Pharmaceuticals slipped 1.9 per cent to $29.00 after saying it had agreed to buy Andrx in a $1.9bn deal designed to bolster its generic drugs business. Shares in Andrx climbed 9.9 per cent to $23.73.Away from M&A, Apple Computer rose 3.9 per cent to $65.68 as Citigroup upgraded shares in the maker of the iconic iPod music player from “hold” to “buy”.The broker said that while product transitions had conspired against the company during the current quarter, it expected new products to fuel growth in April. “Apple remains one of the best ways to play the digitisation of music, photos and video,” analysts said.Elsewhere in the technology sector however, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 7.2 per cent to $34.00 after broker ThinkEquity Partners downgraded the stock from “buy” to “sell”. Analysts said the change was triggered by talk that Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, was beginning to slash prices.
158;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2006-03-13T20:00:56Z;Lex: Capital One;;"How much is peace of mind worth? The answer is a lot, if you happen to be that rare bird: a credit card business with no retail deposits to help fund your lending. And that appears to be a big motivation for Capital One Financial’s pricey acquisition of North Fork Bancorp.North Fork’s strong negotiating hand may seem a little odd at this point in the cycle. After all, with a flat (at times inverted) yield curve,
US banks are experiencing a squeeze on net interest margins – the difference between interest income and expense. But luckily for them, low credit costs have helped offset this squeeze, resulting in still decent returns on equity.Even so, North Fork has extracted a high price. Capital One is forking out a premium of close to $3bn, but can boast synergies worth roughly $1.8bn in present value terms. That is some gap. This is where peace of mind comes in. The argument is that to compete effectively, Capital One has to be able to tap the lower cost of funds that its rivals have by the bucketload. There are niggles with the rationale. After all, a few of the integrated credit card and bank groups fund part of their receivables through securitisation in the capital markets, which yield-hungry investors have facilitated.Still, it must be a little disconcerting to have a business model that most rivals have shifted away from. And relying on the capital markets means worrying about how to fund your business in a credit meltdown, and wondering how much middlemen are skimming off for their role in securitisations. But, having made the calculation that its new business model requires a top-of-the-range deal, Capital has a lot to prove to its investors."
159;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2006-03-13T19:03:53Z;Capital One to buy North Fork for $14.6bn;;Capital One Financial has agreed to buy New York-based North Fork Bancorp for $14.6bn, underlining the high price regional US banks can command in spite of increasingly challenging trading conditions.The terms offered by the credit card issuer represented a 22.8 per cent premium to North Fork’s market price on Friday and 16 times its estimated 2006 earnings.Richard Fairbank, chief executive of Capital One, said the deal was a “great strategic fit” that would bring balance and diversification to the group.One big appeal for Capital One is North Fork’s strong record in attracting retail deposits that would allow the group to rely less on the capital markets to fund its credit card lending.The same strategy lay behind its $5bn acquisition in November of Hibernia, a Louisiana and Texas retail bank.Standard & Poor’s, a credit rating agency, indicated it would probably upgrade Capital One debt on the back of the North Fork deal.Analysts said John Kanas, North Fork’s highly-regarded chief executive, had extracted a good price for the bank, which has an attractive position as the third-biggest bank by deposits in the New York area.Rather than be subsumed into one of the industry giants, North Fork will be a large part of the enlarged group with Mr Kanas becoming president of its banking business, which will generate almost half its earnings, with a seat on the board.Mr Kanas said the decision to sell was partly a reflection of the more difficult market conditions in which the usual gap between long-term and short-term interests rates had disappeared and even reversed.This change in the yield curve makes the banks’ business of extending long-term loans funded by short-term deposits much less profitable. “In the current economic environment, it is hard to imagine that the yield curve will improve any time soon,” said Mr Kanas.Capital One was advised by Citigroup and JPMorgan, and North Fork was advised by Sandler ONeill and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
160;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2005-09-07T19:14:24Z;Capital One cuts Hibernia deal to $5bn;;Capital One, a card issuer, on Wednesday slashed the price it agreed to pay for Hibernia, a Louisiana bank, by 9 per cent in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.Executives at the group bartered to lower the price to $5bn after taking account of the damages the storm brought on Hibernia’s branches in New Orleans, as well as the state of the bank’s loan portfolio and its future prospects. Capital One also postponed the closing date for the transaction until the fourth quarter.Trading in options on Hibernia surged in recent days as uncertainty increased in the market as to whether Capital One would complete the acquisition. The flooding in New Orleans has led to the closure of 60 of the bank’s branches in the region. In early trade, investors pushed Capital One shares down almost 1 per cent to $80.17, while Hibernia shares dipped 4 per cent to $30.Richard Fairbank, Capital One’s chief executive, said: “While no one can predict the impact of Katrina with certainty, I remain convinced of the strategic value of this transaction and believe that Hibernia is well-positioned to grow and generate significant shareholder value over time.”Capital One plans to offer $30.49 per share for Hibernia instead of the $33 per share-offering agreed previously. About 55 per cent of the deal will be paid for in stock.Capital One, which announced it would take over Hibernia in March, had been on the hunt to acquire a retail bank for some time. Hibernia, which has more than $22bn in assets and more than 300 branches spread across Louisiana and Texas, was picked after a long search because Mr Fairbank considered it a “solid,clean bank” that had proved it could grow. Capital One was particularly interested in Hibernia’s operations in Texas, where the biggest US banks such as Wachovia, Citigroup and Bank of America are trying to expand. The card issuer has scores of customers in the state and its car financing business is headquartered there.In recent months, there has been a rash of consolidation in the credit card industry. Banks are scooping up credit card businesses as they try to diversify and look for ways to cross-sell products.Two months ago, Bank of America, which boasts the largest retail network in the US, agreed to pay $35bn to buy MBNA, Capital One’s principal rival.The credit card market has become competitive as issuers battle to increase market share by undercutting prices. In addition, many customers are taking out alternative loans instead of carrying balances on credit cards with high fees.

They include Bank of America, MBNA, Capital One Financial, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.A look at the rhetoric used prior to Thursday’s vote shows this issue is as much about improving society as it is about fattening the bottom line. What is not clear is which goal is more important, or better still, why they have to be mutually exclusive. The bill is the first major revamp of the country’s bankruptcy laws in decades. The House of Representatives will consider the controversial measure after Easter and it should be bound for President George W. Bush’s desk in April.His signature would end more than eight years of work by Republicans who agreed with financial services companies that the rising tide of bankruptcies in the country had to be stopped by making the process more onerous.Jason Goldberg, Lehman analyst, said the law aims to compel more debtors to file Chapter 13, a form of bankruptcy that requires those who can afford to repay at least some of their unsecured debts to make payments rather than Chapter 7, a friendlier form that wipes out all unsecured debt. He said more than two-thirds of bankruptcy filers currently use Chapter 7.The American Bankers Association estimates that personal bankruptcies in the US amounted to $60bn last year. Floyd Stoner, executive director for congressional relations and public policy for the trade group, said earlier this week that financial services companies strongly supported the bill because customers were using bankruptcy as a financial planning tool. “This is a way to start changing the culture,” he said. “What we want to encourage is responsible behavior on the part of those who can afford to repay their debts.”David Fanger, senior vice-president at Moody’s, says a greater reliance on Chapter 13 bankruptcy could lead to a $600m windfall for the credit card industry. Several consumer groups attempted to weaken support for the bill by have accused Congress of offering a gift to companies that already enjoy splendid profits. “While credit card companies urge Congress to erect new bankruptcy barriers for many families, their profits are soaring,” said Travis Plunkett, Legislative Director of the Consumer Federation of America.The consumer groups were joined by Arkadi Kuhlmann, chief executive of ING Direct, a subsidiary of ING Group that is the largest online bank in the US. He said the bill is flawed because the Senate failed to pass amendments that would protect people who filed bankruptcy for reasons related to medical problems, military service or identity theft and also did not remove protections for the wealthy. Lenders should bear some of the responsibility of bankruptcy he said, especially since the methods they use to win new accounts often snare unsophisticated consumers who cannot handle credit well.How much the bottom line of the financial services industry will grow if the bill becomes law is as open to debate as whether bankruptcies will be curbed in the long term. Mr Fanger said tougher bankruptcy rules could encourage lenders to take too much risk when extending credit, leading to more defaults. Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings should also increase in the sixth months following the bill’s final passage as lawyers advertise to convince potential bankruptcy candidates to exploit the grace period before filers must start taking a test to see if they have to file for Chapter 13.Mr Annenberg was right to think that corporations should focus on shareholders. But maybe he should have listened more closely to Mr Clausen. A better balance between focusing on the bottom line and lending responsibly could improve risk management at banks.That might reduce bankruptcies better than any law.*Legacy: A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg, by Christopher Odgen

But the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped fractionally to 10,936.86.Blue chips had eked modest gains for much of the day, but the performance turned sour late in the afternoon as stocks pulled back from 3½-year highs.The surprise ousting of Boeing’s chief executive left investors scratching their heads as to who would pick up the reins at the aerospace group.Mergers and acquisitions were also in the spotlight following news of multi-billion-dollar deals in the defence and banking sectors.Although bullish investors cheered the falling price of oil, the late afternoon slide left the Dow marking time after last week’s sharp rally, which brought blue chips within striking distance of the 11,000 mark – a level last reached in mid-2001.Boeing, the US aerospace giant, fell 0.1 per cent to $58.30 after the company ousted Harry Stonecipher as its chief executive. Boeing said an internal investigation had revealed an inappropriate relationship bet-ween Mr Stonecipher and an unnamed female executive at the company.Two big acquisitions attracted much of the remaining attention. In the defence sector, United Defense Industries, a maker of armoured vehicles and artillery pieces, surged almost 26 per cent to $73.35 after it agreed to a $4.2bn takeover by the US arm of BAE Systems, the British defence group.Meanwhile, Capital One Financial Group, the US credit card company, fell 2.7 per cent to $76 after it announced a $5.3bn takeover of Hibernia, a Louisiana-based bank. Hibernia shares jumped more than 21 per cent to $32.24 on the news.Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Smith Barney, said the recent string of deals was likely to continue as companies took advantage of their strong cash positions.“Companies have such enormous cash flow . . . You don’t even have to go to the pension fund any more,” he said, referring to the source of cash for many deals during the corporate raider days of the 1980s.Semiconductors rose after Qualcomm, the maker of computer chips for wireless devices, raised its profit outlook.

164;COF;Capital One Financial Corp;2005-03-07T00:00:12Z;Capital One to buy Hibernia in $5.5bn deal;;Capital One Financial has agreed to pay $5.35bn to buy Hibernia, a Louisiana-based bank, in a sign that mergers and acquisitions activity could be returning to the US banking industry.Capital One is best known as an issuer of credit cards. But its chairman and chief executive, Rich Fairbank, has long wanted to own a retail bank. He said in an interview that buying Hibernia would diversify Capital One?s sources of revenue and provide a lower cost source of funding.Capital One is offering $33 per share for Hibernia, a 24 per cent premium to the closing price of Hibernia shares on Friday. Capital One will pay 55 per cent in stock and 45 per cent in cash. The transaction should close in the third quarter. Hibernia?s chief executive, Herb Boydstun, will continue to run the bank. ER ?Bo? Campbell, Hibernia?s chairman, will join Capital One?s board.Mr Fairbank announced in late 2003 that he planned to buy a bank. Last year, he considered buying New York-based GreenPoint Financial. He said he picked Hibernia after a long search because it was a ?solid, clean bank? that had proven it could grow by maintaining a dominant position in Louisiana while developing a branch network in Texas. He is betting Capital One, with its well-known national brand and larger size can accelerate the bank?s growth.Hibernia has about 300 branches and more than $22bn in assets spread across Louisiana and Texas. At some point the branches will be rebranded Capital One.Capital One will face tough competition in the Southern US, an area banks find attractive because of population growth. Capital One was particularly interested in Hibernia?s operations in Texas, where Wachovia, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are all expanding.Capital One has a lot of existing credit card and lending customers in the state and its auto finance business is headquartered there. Mr Fairbank said he would be eager to expand the bank in areas such as Dallas and Houston, two of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the US.The deal between Capital One and Hibernia represents the return of large transactions to the US banking industry, which experienced a wave of consolidation between October 2003, when Bank of America agreed to buy FleetBoston Financial for $47bn, and August last year, when Toronto-Dominion agreed to buy a majority stake in Banknorth for more than $3.5bn.Since TD?s move, there have been no deals in excess of $1bn, leading many industry observers to wonder whether valuations had risen too much for more M&A activity.
