0;AWK;American Water Works;2016-08-30T20:51:05Z;US banks rally as rate rise hopes grow;S&P sector index is top performer of any industry group in August;US banks have jumped this month, contrasting with a broader lack of volatility that has descended over Wall Street, as Federal Reserve policymakers primed investors for a rate rise potentially as soon as next month.The S&P 500 banks index, a gauge that includes America’s biggest lenders, has climbed 7 per cent in August, marking the top performance of any industry group and outpacing the broad S&P 500 that has ticked up by less than two-tenths of a per cent.Lenders have struggled this year as the Fed has dramatically pared back its plans to increase interest rates as volatility in the financial markets, slower than expected economic growth and trouble abroad has frustrated policymakers.However, Janet Yellen, Fed chair, Stanley Fischer, vice-chair, and other high-ranking officials said at the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium last week that the case for adding to the December 2015 rate increase had been bolstered recently by upbeat economic data.Investors have taken notice, sending the implied odds of a 2016 rate rise up to about 60 per cent on Tuesday, from just 35.7 per cent at the start of the month, according to Bloomberg calculations based on federal funds futures.That has come as good news for bank investors since lenders earn profits on the difference in the rate that they charge for loans and their own funding costs — a margin that has been depressed by low interest rates.Indeed, the advance has helped the banks index trim its year-to-date decline to 2.7 per cent from 9.1 per cent at the end of July.Among the gainers has been Bank of America, seen as particularly sensitive to rates because of its large domestic retail business, which has climbed 11.7 per cent to $16.19. Citigroup, another large bank, has advanced by 9.3 per cent to $47.90.If the economic reports that are due for release this week, including Friday’s monthly US job figures, paint a rosy picture, it could spark further gains for financials, said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group.“The impact on financials will be efficient and positive,” he said.On the opposite side of the spectrum, the utilities sector has dropped by 6.4 per cent in August, cutting its year-to-date rise to about 11.4 per cent.NRG Energy, a power company, has been the worst performer, dropping 11.9 per cent this month to $12.19 while American Water Works has fallen by 10.4 per cent to $74.03.The sector has been among the biggest gainers in 2016 as investors have sought consistent dividend streams with bond yields tumbling to historic lows.The spectre of higher rates in the US, combined with concerns that valuations may have become stretched, has tarnished some of the sector’s appeal.“We advocate reducing popular positions where prices have moved beyond fundamentals,” said Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, referring to utilities and other assets that mimic bonds.At the close of trade on Tuesday, the S&P 500 had dipped 0.2 per cent to 2,176.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 18,454.3 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.2 per cent to 5,222.9.
1;AWK;American Water Works;2010-06-06T07:35:43Z;Thirst for ‘blue gold’ set to grow;;Some investors need more convincing than others about the investment potential of water. But for those that need little encouragement, clean, fresh water is simply one thing: “blue gold”.Their reasoning is this: while freshwater supplies are static, the global population is expected to jump from around 6.4bn today to some 9bn by 2050.Dieter Kuffer, a senior portfolio manager at Sustainable Asset Management, one of the first companies to launch a water fund, says: “Water is a precious resource in short supply and companies offering innovative solutions to promote efficient use of this ‘blue gold’ will prosper more than others.”The facts are compelling. According to Pictet, which runs the largest European water fund, only a fraction of the water available globally can be used by humans. The majority is either salt water, ice or snow, or is too heavily polluted.To ensure that precious water supplies are used more efficiently in the years ahead and that water can be supplied to the consumer, massive investment needs to be made in water infrastructure, argues the fund house.In the US, for example, it has been estimated that some $900bn (£615bn, €738bn) will be required in funding between 1999 and 2019, while in the European Union, expenditure totalling about €350bn is planned before 2025 to bring the infrastructure up to the level required by EU legislation.Investors seem to be warming to the argument. Since Pictet launched its water fund in January 2000 – the first of its kind – the vehicle has amassed some €2.4bn of assets and includes holdings in companies such as Veolia Environment, Suez Environment, Severn Trent, and American Water Works.“The success we have had with this fund is down to the fact we targeted something people can easily understand,” says Philippe Rohner, one of the managers of Pictet’s €2.4bn fund, which has produced annualised returns of 3 per cent since its launch in 2000 in euro terms.“People can quite clearly grasp that a demand and supply issue exists, that infrastructure needs to be built, and investment needs to be made.”Although Pictet was the first to market, a significant number of companies also offer water funds. As well as Sustainable Asset Management, both KBC and Sarasin run water vehicles while a cluster of ETFs offer exposure to the market. These include Lyxor ETF World Water, iShares S&P Global Water, and PowerShares Palisades Global.“In terms of the competition, there seems to be a mushroom effect in the water fund marketplace,” says Mr Rohner. “When the equity markets are doing well a number of competitors pop up, but when markets slump they tend to disappear.”He continues: “There are only a couple of other names out there that, like us, have been through and survived the investment cycles. The others seem to just come and go.”Mr Rohner believes companies often underestimate the number of staff needed to support the investment process.“To make the right investments you need to stay ahead of the regulatory environment in each country. Water is a highly-regulated sector and making investments in water-related companies without proper knowledge of what the regulator is planning is very risky.”The largest holding in Pictet’s fund is Veolia Environment, the French water and waste water services company, which accounts for just over 5 per cent of assets. Its largest 10 stocks make up some 35 per cent of total holdings.Matt Dickerson, chief marketing officer at Summit Global Management, the US water investment specialist, is also a fan of Veolia. “Veolia is an excellent case study for the water industrial business,” he says.“In the first quarter of 2009, Veolia’s water division revenues were up 8.4 per cent globally, 16.7 per cent in the US, and 20 per cent in China.Nonetheless, the economic downturn will undoubtedly impact the volume and rate of investment going into hydro commerce in the near term, Mr Dickerson admits.But, he says: “Given the compelling, recession-resistant business model, combined with the urgency of water challenges across the globe, we believe that the outlook for water stocks today is much better than it was 25 years ago, or even five years ago. Hydro commerce will undoubtedly remain one of the world’s most vital industries.”

3;AWK;American Water Works;2008-04-23T22:32:52Z;American Water debut disappoints;;"American Water Works, the largest US private sector water utility, fell as much as 6 per cent in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday after German energy group RWE was forced to cut both the price and amount of shares it offered in its US subsidiary.The company’s float came against the backdrop of a subdued market for US
public offerings with the amount of equity issuance running well below last year’s levels. So far this year, just 27 companies have come to market in the US, raising a combined $27.4bn.Discounting the $19.7bn raised through the IPO of credit card company Visa last month, however, just $7.7bn has been raised through US-listed IPOs, almost half the amount raised through 77 deals by the same time last year.The partial flotation of American Water will bring in $1.2bn but that is $400m less than RWE was targeting last week and led the German electricity and gas group to issue a profit warning.Shares in American Water were down 2.8 per cent, to $20.89, shortly before midday in New York, having been as low as $20.22 earlier in the trading session.The IPO of American Water has turned into a troubled saga for RWE and its new chief executive, Jürgen Grossmann.Originally announced in November 2005, the IPO was first held up by an excruciating regulatory approval process in the US. Then, Mr Grossmann in his first big act as chief executive postponed the flotation last November, citing difficult market conditions in a move that unsettled investors.RWE, Germany’s second-largest energy group, sold 36 per cent of American Water rather than the 40 per cent it hoped for at a price of $21.50 rather than the $24-$26 price range it aimed for last week. It said it hoped to sell the rest of American Water later this year, if market conditions allowed.RWE will take a €600m ($954m) charge to go on top of a €429m one last year over American Water and this will mean net profit is likely to fall this year rather than rise 10 per cent, as the German group had previously forecast.Despite raising less than expected, American Water is the second-largest US IPO of the year to date, behind that of Visa. Several other companies, including alternative investment houses such as AQR, have elected to postpone stock market floats amid worries about the US credit crisis and the health of the US economy."
4;AWK;American Water Works;2006-11-08T14:14:31Z;RWE;;Passing water usually produces a sense of relief. Yet despite getting a good price for Thames Water last month, RWE finds itself in an uncomfortable position.Scottish Power’s announcement that it has received an approach from an unidentified suitor serves to emphasise the dilemma the German utility faces. Strategically, buying Scottish Power would make sense, since it would fit neatly with RWE’s existing UK business. The problem is the price: Scottish Power shares hit 798p at one point on Wednesday morning, 40 per cent more than Eon was willing to pay a year ago. Thankfully, RWE swiftly denied it was involved.Post-Thames, though, RWE will have net cash of more than €2bn on its books, making it look like an obvious bidder for pretty much anything available. But with European utilities’ valuations up on the back of bid fever this year, there are no bargains to be had.RWE has said it will raise its dividend payout ratio to 70-80 per cent over the next two years. Even then, with the disposal of American Water scheduled for the second half of next year, RWE will probably still have net cash by the end of 2007.Part of the problem is that until American Water is sold, RWE is reluctant to make any bold statements. It would probably prefer to hold out the possibility of a big return of cash to shareholders in 2008. That would help hold investors’ interest as well as leave time for bid fever in Europe’s utilities sector to ease. RWE would then be ready to pounce. It is interesting that, on Tuesday, the company said it would replace its current chief financial officer next year with Eon’s head of mergers and acquisitions.Cash rich and strategically fenced-in for now, RWE may yet make a tempting target itself. With an enterprise value of €66bn, it would not be easy to swallow, although the scope for releveraging and further disposals helps. Italy’s Enel, for example, had €50bn of financing lined up for a bid for Suez. Moreover, one other apparent obstacle, that RWE is 31 per cent-owned by German municipalities, has also taken a knock. On Tuesday, the mayor of Düsseldorf, the city which owns 1.1 per cent of RWE, said the city would be willing to sell out. The waiting game carries its own risks.
5;AWK;American Water Works;2006-03-13T19:19:27Z;Veolia chief insists strategy is unaffected;;Henri Proglio, chairman of Veolia, on Monday insisted his water, waste and transport group was not at a strategic impasse after abandoning a plan to launch a joint bid with Enel of Italy for its French rival Suez.Mr Proglio said the group continued to study several options, including a possible bid for the US water business of Germany’s RWE, American Water Works. “We are going to study it,” although adding the chances of acquiring it were “unlikely”. “There are no financial limits [on Veolia]” as the group would be prepared to turn to shareholders for the right deal.”The head of France’s largest water and waste treatment group said acquisitions would be the exception, however. Announcing a 33 per cent rise in annual net recurring income to €627m ($749m), on sales up 12 per cent to €25.2bn, he stressed the group’s determination to deliver continued organic growth.He was equally at pains to damp speculation over his role in the controversy surrounding Enel’s botched attempt to launch a co-ordinated bid for Suez. Last month the French government hastily reversed its opposition to a merger of Suez with state-controlled Gaz de France once rumours of Enel’s interest became public.Enel has since accused Veolia of abandoning a joint bid for Suez after political pressure, even suggesting that French President Jacques Chirac spoke to Mr Proglio. The Veolia boss, who may have to explain his version of events to the European Commission as it investigates Enel’s claims, repeated his insistence that the bid project was abandoned when it became clear it would be hostile.“We did not want to participate in a hostile market operation,” he said. He also contradicted Enel’s claim that Veolia had suggested the idea of a bid. Mr Proglio repeatedly stressed that Veolia had been approached with an idea that was “intellectually interesting”.He said that despite the controversy, Veolia would still be interested in acquiring Suez’s international water assets.
6;AWK;American Water Works;2005-11-07T17:56:16Z;European bourses higher on utility M&A talk;;Gains on Wall Street and talk of further merger and acquisition activity boosted European equities on Monday as takeover rumours swirled around the utilities sector.The Eurofirst 300 index built on last week’s 4 per cent gain, climbing 5.21 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 1,226.19.French investors were more subdued after an eleventh night of rioting in the Paris suburbs. The CAC 40 underperformed, adding 0.1 per cent to 4,503.65.Eon, Germany’s biggest listed utility company, was up 0.5 per cent to €75.89 as expectation strengthened that it might make a bid for Scottish Power.“We maintain our view that a price up to 625p would be acceptable for Eon to pay,” said Ian Mitchell, an analyst at JPMorgan.RWE, the German utilities company, jumped 1.7 per cent to €57.21, propelled by Friday evening’s announcement that it would sell its UK and US water businesses, Thames Water and American Water Works in separate deals that could bring in as much as €15bn.Deutsche Bank increased its price target on RWE from €59 to €61.50. ”The decision to sell off both businesses separately is, in our view, great news,” said a DrKW research note.RWE said it was looking for further growth opportunities in Europe, but it is not expected to make a counterbid for Scottish Power.Elsewhere in the sector, France’s Veolia Environnement gained 1 per cent to €35.31 after hitting expectations with a 17.3 per cent rise in nine-month operating profit and confirming its full-year targets.Munich Re, Europe’s largest reinsurer, added 0.8 per cent to €103.55 on third quarter results that showed one-off gains from investments outweighed its losses from US hurricane damage. Munich Re reported third-quarter net profit before minorites up by a third to €513m and said its full-year target was still within reach.Heidelbergcement jumped 1.9 per cent to €67.36 as CSFB raised its price target to €60 from €55 ahead of the German cement company’s third-quarter results on Wednesday.Analysts expected the comapny to report a 32 per cent rise in third-quarter net profit, driven by high demand and prices in key US and Indonesian markets.Ryanair was one of the day’s sharpest fallers, sliding 3.1 per cent to €6.78 after it accompanied forecast-beating third-quarter results with a cautious outlook for the winter season. The Irish comapny, whose shares have surged 40 per cent over the last year, maintained its forecast for a 10 per cent rise in full-year net profit, adjusted for one-off items.In contrast, Lufthansa, which some analysts expected to raise its full-year guidance when it reports quarterly earnings on Thursday, gained 1.5 per cent to €11.83. Air France-KLM rose 1.6 per cent to €14.39 after announcing passenger numbers had risen 8.9 per cent in October.In pharmaceuticals, Celesio slid 3.4 per cent to €69.34 having been downgraded by Deutsche to “hold” from “buy” with a €2 lower price target of €72.Novo Nordisk gained 2.4 per cent to DKr336 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the world’s leading insulin maker to “buy” from “hold”. The broker said the worries over the impact on earnings of Pfizer’s Exubra, an inhaled insulin treatment, were overdone.KPN dropped 1.2 per cent to €8.08 after reporting third-quarter results in line with expectations, but disappointed investors by remaining silent on takeover prospects following last week’s flurry of telecoms consolidation. The Dutch telecoms group’s core earnings fell to €1.15bn from €1.21bn a year earlier.German retailer Metro bounced 1.6 per cent to €37.35 after announcing plans to raise up to €504m through an initial public offering of its Praktiker DIY chain.InBev, the Belgian brewer whose beers include Stella Artois, shot up 2.7 per cent to €33.65 when it said it was talking to Clearbrook Capital about the prospects of supplying beer to UK pub group Spirit. Clearbrook Capital, a private equity firm, is taking part in a bid for Spirit Group.Oil was the weakest sector, down 0.9 per cent, as warm weather in the US sent crude prices below $60 a barrel. Statoil fell 1.6 per cent to NKr151 and Cepsa dropped 1.3 per cent to €39.68, while Finnish refiner Neste Oil shed 1.9 per cent to €25.87.
7;AWK;American Water Works;2005-10-25T17:11:34Z;Lex: RWE/Thames Water;;"A leak was inevitable. The rumoured sale of Thames Water and American Water Works is big news for RWE and its shareholders. The multi-utility strategy of which global water was the cornerstone of Dietmar Kuhnt, former chief executive of RWE, never delivered. It has acted as a drag on the group when the core energy business is powering ahead amid tight electricity and gas markets. A business taking up 40 per cent of the asset base and investment budget contributes only a quarter of group profits.Separating out the water business could lead to a re-rating of RWE, which, prior to Monday's initial reports, was valued at 7.1 times 2006 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation a 10 per cent discount to Europe's power stocks. That was 18 per cent below Merrill Lynch's sum-of-the-parts valuation of the group. However, the existing transparency of the regulated water business model suggests caution on estimating the amount of value to be flushed out by withdrawing from water.Spinning off a 30 per cent stake would only be the first step anyway. But if and when RWE fully parted ways with its water business, it would leave the German utility looking undergeared. Net debt/ebitda could fall well below 1 times. With water's regulated cash flows gone, plenty of acquisition firepower available, and a scarcity of reasonably-priced opportunities in the energy sector, RWE's risk profile would deteriorate. Even so, the rationale for emphatically closing the book on Mr Kuhnt's legacy remains strong.- Click here to add your comments
