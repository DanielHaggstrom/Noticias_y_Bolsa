In the study, patients have stem cells that create blood cells collected and edited using the new technology based on the Cas9 enzyme, which binds to DNA and cuts it, shutting off the gene. The edited cells are then placed back into the body in a stem cell transplant. The company is also trialling the same technique in a study to find a treatment for sickle cell disease. Samarth Kulkarni, chief executive of Crispr Therapeutics, said it was “an important scientific and medical milestone and the beginning of our efforts to fully realise the promise of CRISPR/Cas9 therapies as a new class of potentially transformative medicines to treat serious diseases”.The treatments are being developed in partnership with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Dr David Altshuler, chief scientific officer at Vertex, said the diseases were “serious” and “life-threatening”. The companies are aiming to create a “one time potential curative therapy”, he said. The announcement comes after a Chinese scientist provoked uproar last year by using the Crispr technology to genetically edit babies. He Jiankui of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen claims to have edited the genomes of twins Lulu and Nana while they were embryos to remove the CCR5gene, which allows HIV to infect cells.A study published in the journal Cell last week suggested the change may have other effects — including possibly enhancing their ability to learn and form memories. Scientists around the world, including the co-inventors of the Crispr technology, condemned the move, concerned about the unnecessary editing of human embryos, which pass changes to genes down the generations. The Chinese government said Mr He “seriously violated” state laws in pursuit of “personal fame and fortune”, while his university said he violated academic ethics. But Crispr Therapeutics is focused on changing individual patients’ genes, not making edits that could last for generations.The stock jumped 25.2 per cent to $39.65, with Vertex Pharmaceuticals nudging up 0.3 per cent to $186.33. Shares of other biotech companies specialising in Crispr — which have languished on concerns about how long the technology could take to get to market and potential side effects — also rose. Editas shares gained 5.3 per cent to $20.93 and Intellia increased 6.1 per cent to $14.36. The Nasdaq biotech index was up 2 per cent, buoyed also by Roche’s $4.8bn acquisition of Spark Therapeutics, in another signal to investors that large pharmaceutical companies are willing to pay up for gene therapies. Brad Loncar, who runs exchange traded funds focused on cancer immunotherapies and Chinese biotech, said it was in the “top five most exciting days” for biotech investors in more than a decade. 
1;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2018-01-08T05:00:59Z;Vertex’s cystic fibrosis treatment makes it a hot company;Biotech group’s promising results help it defy broader investor fears over sector;For many large biotech companies, 2017 was a difficult year, as investors fretted the industry was unprepared for the looming loss of patent protection on top-selling drugs.But Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which develops medicines for cystic fibrosis, defied the general gloom. After overcoming fierce competition four years ago, the company’s share price nearly doubled last year, taking its equity value to $37bn.In July, the company published positive results from mid-stage trials suggesting its novel approach of combining three drugs could benefit 90 per cent of patients with cystic fibrosis, a fatal disease of the respiratory and digestive systems that affects 75,000 people worldwide.That would be a sharp improvement from Vertex’s position today — its drugs can help a little more than half of sufferers.Analysts predict the company’s revenues, which are expected to be $2.1bn this year, will rise to $4.2bn by 2020, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Vertex is about to begin late-stage studies of these new “triplet” drugs, and some investors think the US Food and Drug Administration could give a green light based on early results from these trials.The company is expected to be one of the star performers this week at JPMorgan’s healthcare conference in San Francisco, the largest annual meeting of global pharma executives.Shareholders will be listening for clues on whether the drugs might be approved by regulators sooner than Wall Street expects, meaning sales would climb more quickly than forecast.“We know how short [the trials] can be and we know what to measure and when,” says Jeffrey Leiden, chief executive of Vertex, in a recent interview at the company’s offices in Boston Harbour.“We are in discussions with the FDA about how we get these medicines to these patients as quickly as possible,” he adds.Vertex’s position at the top of the biotech class of 2017 is all the more surprising because the group faced an existential crisis just four years ago.The company had built a successful hepatitis C business by launching the first medicine that could block the virus in 2011. But then in 2013, Gilead brought out a superior drug that effectively cured the illness in a matter of months.Sales of Vertex’s drug, Incivek, evaporated. As the company’s market value tumbled, its directors considered raising a white flag.“There was a lot of ‘should we just sell the company?’” recalls Dr Leiden, who became chief executive in 2012. “There were some board members who were advocating that.”Dr Leiden convinced the directors to keep the company independent and to adopt a new strategy that involved taking the lucrative but shortlived proceeds from Incivek and ploughing them into its cystic fibrosis programme.The turnround involved trimming the headcount from roughly 2,100 to 1,800. It now stands at about 2,200.Dr Leiden says the company’s revival is down to its decision to invest a greater proportion of revenues in research and development than rivals. In the first nine months of this year, it spent 55 per cent of sales on R&D, compared to 13 per cent at Amgen, the largest biotech group.We can easily come up with a list of 20 diseases that fit our model and that’s more than enough to sustain the companyBecause cystic fibrosis is a disease that is diagnosed at birth by genetic screening, and then treated by specialist doctors, the company does not spend much on marketing to patients and physicians.“We have tiny little sales forces — we sell in the US with 20 sales reps — there is no direct-to-consumer advertising, no marketing,” says Dr Leiden.However, the company has been targeted by politicians for its high prices. Kalydeco, one of its cystic fibrosis drugs, has a price tag of $311,000, while Orkambi, a drug for patients with a different genetic mutation, is $272,000.Some countries, including the UK, have refused to pay for Orkambi, meaning patients cannot access the medicine.Dr Leiden says it is fair to charge high sums for an innovative drug for a rare disease. “These medicines were revolutionary for patients. They changed lives. They changed the course of the disease,” he says.For now, Vertex faces little competition in cystic fibrosis. The main rival is an experimental medicine being developed by a partnership of AbbVie and Galapagos, but it is some distance behind.However, the company is not immune from the kind of threats faced by other large biotech companies. After a decade of beating Big Pharma by developing a handful of drugs for serious illnesses, investors are worried that such a narrow focus has left the biotech industry poorly prepared for its first big patent cliff.Companies such as Celgene — which became a drugmaking behemoth by building a blood cancer franchise — have struggled to pivot to new diseases, stoking fears they are one-trick ponies.Some investors are looking ahead to when sales of Vertex’s cystic fibrosis medicines will peak, and asking whether it will be able to find a successful treatment for yet another disease.“Vertex does have a good record — they were first with hepatitis C and cystic fibrosis,” says Geoff Meacham, analyst at Barclays. “But they’ve also had some real disruptions. Investors want to see them succeed in another category outside cystic fibrosis.”Join the FT’s deputy editor Roula Khalaf for a panel discussion on the future of Alzheimer’s on January 18 in LondonDr Leiden says the company is working on other rare diseases caused by genetic defects such as sickle cell.“We can easily come up with a list of 20 diseases that fit our model and that’s more than enough to sustain the company,” he says.However, Mr Meacham says some investors would like to see the company diversify by acquiring a smaller biotech group with a different focus. “If they can get into another area of rare diseases for $5bn or less, investors would be happy,” he says.Vertex itself regularly appears as a takeover target on lists compiled by investors and analysts, but Dr Leiden insists the company is not for sale. “Our board has been pretty clear all along that our intention is to do this on our own,” he says.“We’ve all seen the movie where a biotech has been acquired, often by bigger pharma companies, and the innovation disappears,” he adds.This article has been amended to correct erroneous employment numbers provided by the company. Vertex’s headcount fell to 1,800 before rising back up to 2,200.
2;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Vertex spikes on good news for cystic fibrosis drugs;;Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ shares spiked nearly 25 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday, following positive data from studies of several three-drug combinations used to treat cystic fibrosis.The Boston-based biotech company focuses on treatments for life-threatening diseases like cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder that can cause chronic lung infections and potentially fatal damage. Over the past 12 months, its shares have risen 47.8 per cent.In Tuesday’s announcement, Vertex said that phase 1 and 2 studies showed that three different triple combination drug regimens were “generally well tolerated”, with the majority of adverse events being “mild to moderate in severity”.Jeffrey Chodakewitz, the company’s chief medical officer, said:“These safety and efficacy data are clear and compelling, indicating significant potential benefit for people with CF from each of these three different triple combination regimens. We will be collecting and evaluating additional data from these and other studies and will make a decision on which regimen(s) to take forward into pivotal program(s), which we expect to begin in the first half of 2018.”
3;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Vertex shares surge to 14-month high on cystic fibrosis drug hope;;And we have take-off.Shares in Vertex Pharmaceuticals are rocketing higher on Wednesday after the Boston-based drug maker reported late Tuesday positive results for a closely watched clinical trial of its lead experimental treatment for cystic fibrosis.The stock surged as much as 24 per cent in early trade to hit a 14-month high of $117.11.The clinical trial success for the combination treatment should pave the way for regulators to approve a new option for sufferers of the deadly genetic illness, which is estimated to affect 75,000 people worldwide.While Vertex already sells a drug for cystic fibrosis called Orkambi, the new treatment is seen as having wider commercial appeal because it has fewer side effects.Orkambi generated revenues of $980m last year, less than half the amount analysts had forecasted because of the drug’s side effects. However, analysts at Cowen reckon approval of the new drug could boost Vertex’s cystic fibrosis revenue to $3.9bn by 2021.By comparison, Vertex generated $1.68bn in revenue for the whole of 2016.
4;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2017-03-29T01:08:08Z;Vertex Pharmaceuticals hails new cystic fibrosis drug;Combination treatment offers safer option for patients suffering from deadly illness;Vertex Pharmaceuticals said that a combination of two of its medicines had successfully treated cystic fibrosis in a closely watched clinical trial, paving the way for regulators to approve a new option for sufferers of the deadly genetic illness.The treatment had fewer side-effects than another drug combination already sold by Vertex, known as Orkambi, which became the first medicine able to treat a large proportion of cystic fibrosis patients when it was approved in 2015.Sales of Orkambi have significantly underperformed investor expectations because about 15 per cent of eligible patients stopped taking the treatment due to intolerable side-effects such as chest tightening.This latest combination, which has not yet been named, would offer an alternative to those who cannot tolerate Orkambi’s side-effects, and to newly diagnosed patients, said Steve Rowe, director of the cystic fibrosis research centre at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.“The efficacy looks very similar, and you lose the problem of ‘bronchospasm’ or chest tightening, which affected 10-15 per cent of patients,” added Dr Rowe.Orkambi generated revenues of $980m last year, less than half the amount analysts had been forecasting, as doctors stopped prescribing the medicine and experimented with lower doses.Vertex also struggled to secure reimbursement from cash-strapped European healthcare systems because of the medicine’s $259,000 price tag.Shares of the biotech group suffered during 2016, losing more than 41 per cent of their value. But the stock has rallied 22 per cent this year in anticipation of data from studies of new experimental medicines.The company’s shares rose 18 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday as investors digested the results of the latest clinical trial, giving Vertex a market capitalisation of more than $27bn.About 75,000 people worldwide have cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease caused by defects in a gene that controls water and salt levels in cells. The illness leads to a build-up of mucus in the respiratory system, lung damage, and life-threatening infections. Many sufferers die before they are 40.Vertex won approval for the first drug that slows down the disease, Kalydeco, in 2012, although the medicine only works in a minority of about 4 per cent of patients who have a specific genetic mutation.The subsequent approval of Orkambi in 2015 provided a treatment option to almost half of people who suffer from the most common “homozygous” form of the disease.The trial of the latest combination was as good as Orkambi at boosting a patient’s lung function but was also safer. Less than 3 per cent of patients left the trial due to side effects, around the same proportion as those taking the placebo.The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every FridayAnalysts said the biggest opportunity for Vertex would be to add a third drug to the new combo to create a “triplet” medicine, able to treat the roughly 25 per cent of patients who still have no options.Vertex is trialling several drugs that it believes could become the third agent in such a triplet, and the company is expected to release data from mid-stage trials this year.Analysts at UBS think a triplet drug that successfully treated these “heterozygous” patients would generate up to $3bn in annual sales for Vertex.“This combination treatment may provide a promising new option for treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in the future, and brings us increasingly closer to our goal of developing new medicines for all people with the disease,” said Dr Jeffrey Chodakewitz, chief medical officer at Vertex.Vertex faces competition in the race to develop a drug for untreatable cystic fibrosis patients, chiefly from Galapagos, a Belgo-Dutch biotech group that is developing medicines in collaboration with “big pharma” company AbbVie.Galapagos is expected to release trial data on its triplet medicine either later this year or at the start of 2018.
5;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2016-08-22T20:56:26Z;Marathon Oil slips on broad sector fall;US stocks make little progress at start of the week;Marathon Oil led a broad decline in the oil sector’s stocks as crude prices fell back after a bumper seven-session rally.West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, fell 3 per cent to $47.05 on Monday, ending a rally that saw its price rise more than 20 per cent since August 2.Last week’s rise came off the back of hopes that Opec and other big oil producers might finally be looking at a long-discussed output freeze. Positive data and bets by hedge funds that the oil price would rise also helped to send prices higher.But Monday’s pullback led to a broad decline in oil company stock prices.Marathon, the Houston-based exploration and production company, led the pack, falling 6.9 per cent to $15.64 amid the additional investor pressure triggered by managerial changes.JR Sult, the company’s chief financial officer, left the company on Monday, citing personal reasons. Pat Wagner, vice-president of corporate development and strategy, has been named interim chief financial officer.Marathon, also the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 index on Monday, has struggled due to the prolonged drop in oil prices.It reported its sixth straight quarterly loss this month, cutting its production outlook for the year. It has curtailed spending and sold off more than $1bn in assets.It said its revenue fell below $1bn in May for the first time since it became a standalone company in 2002.Other oil stocks also struggled. Murphy Oil was down 3.3 per cent to $29.07, Noble Energy fell 1.5 per cent to $35.57 and Southwestern Energy declined 1.8 per cent to $13.47.At the other end of the spectrum, pharmaceutical companies saw early gains after Pfizer reached a deal worth $14bn to acquire California biotechnology company Medivation.Pfizer, the world’s second-largest drugmaker, saw its stock tick up by 0.2 per cent before giving up ground and closing 0.4 per cent lower at $34.84. Medivation, not in the S&P 500 index, soared higher, up 19.7 per cent to $80.42.The top three performers in the S&P 500 index were pharmaceutical companies.Regeneron rose 3.6 per cent to $418.65, Vertex Pharmaceuticals gained 3 per cent to $100.96 and Alexion Pharmaceuticals climbing 3.3 per cent to $136.53.Elsewhere, clothing brand Urban Outfitters saw its stock fall 3.2 per cent to $36.61 as Goldman Sachs downgraded it from buy to neutral. The bank suggested it was at “near peak” operating performance, leaving less room for meaningful improvement.The S&P 500 was relatively unchanged at 2,182.6, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 18,529.4, and the Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.1 per cent higher to 5,244.6.
6;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2015-12-15T06:00:49Z;AstraZeneca on fast track to companion diagnostics;Pharmaceutical companies accept lower sales as they shift to personalised treatments;The green light given by US regulators last month to AstraZeneca for a new lung cancer treatment marked one of the fastest drug approvals on record. This process can sometimes take a decade or more, but the company took just two and a half years to reach market following the first human trial.One of the reasons for the speed was the highly targeted nature of the medicine, Tagrisso. It is aimed at a subset of lung cancer patients whose tumours have spread and developed a treatment-resistant mutation. This meant trials took place among a relatively small and well-defined group of patients.This was the latest example of the accelerating shift by pharmaceutical companies away from one-size-fits-all drugs towards more personalised medicines. Underpinning the trend has been the rise of “companion diagnostics”, which pinpoint the patients who stand to benefit.For the pharma industry, the rise of personalised medicine means accepting lower sales volumes than those achieved by traditional blockbusters. But it promises to accelerate development and help demonstrate the value of new products at a time when drug prices are facing mounting scrutiny from budget-constrained health systems around the world.“We can offer a better value proposition if we can identify the patients who will benefit and remove those who will not,” says Greg Rossi, head of the oncology business for AstraZeneca in the UK.Tagrisso is aimed at non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC) with two genetic mutations called EGFR and T790M. About 10 per cent of NSCLC patients exhibit EGFR and two-thirds of these are T790M positive. AstraZeneca worked with the diagnostics arm of Roche, the Swiss pharma group, to develop a test for the mutant genes.This marked the second targeted oncology drug launched by AstraZeneca with a companion diagnostic in less than a year, after the approval of Lynparza, also known as olaparib, for ovarian cancer patients with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.The UK-based company has put personalised medicine at the heart of its turnround efforts as old, mass-market blockbusters such as its Nexium heartburn pill and Crestor statin lose patent protection. Half of the drugs AstraZeneca expects to launch by 2020 will come with companion diagnostics and 80 per cent of those in its research and development pipeline are personalised.It is still hard to develop targeted therapies for many diseases because there isn’t enough scientific understanding of . . . what biomarkers would be usefulOthers are pursuing similar strategies. In October, New Jersey-based Merck won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of its Keytruda medicine against non-small cell lung cancer together with a companion diagnostic to detect a protein associated with the disease.Keytruda is among the leaders in a hotly anticipated new class of cancer drug that disables a so-called “immune checkpoint”, called the programmed death ligand 1, or PD-L1, in a way that frees the body’s disease-fighting T-cells to attack tumours.However, only about 22 per cent of NSCLC patients have high enough levels of PD-L1 for Keytruda to be effective. This limits the size of Merck’s potential market but promises to reassure healthcare providers and insurers that the hefty $12,500 a month US price is worth paying.“Pharma is realising that having diagnostics hand in hand with drug development is really important,” says Rudi Pauwels, chief executive of Biocartis, a Belgian diagnostics company. “You cannot have precision medicines without precision diagnostics.”Roche has been regarded as the leader in personalised medicine since it launched Herceptin for women with HER 2-positive breast cancer in 1998, bolstered by its in-house diagnostics division.AstraZeneca last year sought to strengthen its own diagnostic capabilities through the $150m acquisition of Definiens, a Germany company specialising in tissue-based tests to identify which patients respond to a drug.However, Ruth March, head of personalised healthcare at AstraZeneca, said the company had no intention of building a full-blown diagnostics business to match Roche. Instead, it would continue to cherry pick different diagnostic partners for different drugs.Other developers of companion diagnostics include Abbott Laboratories, Agilent Technologies, Myriad Genetics and Qiagen.“We have made a strategic decision to go with lots of different diagnostic partners,” says Dr March. “Some companies are stronger in some technologies than others.”What are the next frontiers in this alliance between pharma and diagnostics? AstraZeneca is one of numerous companies exploring the potential of so-called “liquid biopsies” to detect fragments of tumour DNA circulating in blood. It is hoped this could prove more sensitive than tissue biopsies and allow cancer mutations to be detected at an earlier stage.Diagnostic companies are also seeking to move beyond companion products for individual drugs to develop more sophisticated tests that can screen for multiple biomarkers at once.Janet Woodcock, director of the centre for drug evaluation and research at the FDA, cautioned in a blog that, while the industry had made great strides, there was a long way to go: “It is still hard to develop targeted therapies for many diseases because there isn’t enough scientific understanding of why the disease occurs and what biomarkers would be useful.”The push for greater personalisation was given a boost by US President Barack Obama last January when he used his annual State of the Union address to launch a precision medicine initiative. This included $215m of federal investment in measures to speed the push for targeted therapies.Watching on as a guest of the US president was a cystic fibrosis patient called Bill Elder. He has been successfully treated with a much-heralded drug from Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which targets a genetic mutation affecting 4 per cent of the 30,000 people in the US with the disease.“That is the promise of precision medicine,” said Mr Obama in a press conference after the speech. “Delivering the right treatments, at the right time, every time to the right person.”
7;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Biotech leads Nasdaq to fresh record close;Technology-heavy index powered by Yellen comments on plan to raise rates slowly;The Nasdaq Composite closed at a new record high on Thursday as the prospect that the Federal Reserve will only gradually tighten monetary policy buoyed US stocks.The technology heavy index climbed 1.3 per cent to close at a record 5,132.95 - smashing the level reached at the height of the tech bubble in 2000. It was led on Thursday by a near 3 per cent advance in the biotech sector.The gains follow comments from Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday that the central bank would raise rates slowly and there remained division over the pace at which it should tighten.“The underlying message from yesterday’s meeting was that the prevailing bias remains for the start of policy normalisation later this year,” said Millan Mulraine, strategist with TD Securities. “Wrapped within that message was a dovish tone that suggests the Fed is placing a greater burden on the data to justify any policy action.”The comments buoyed biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which have enjoyed a strong rally this year on industry consolidation and drug advances. Shares of Celgene advanced 4.24 per cent to close at $116.92, Regeneron climbed 2.94 per cent to close at $527.97, Vertex gained 2.89 per cent to close at $127.63, and Amgen rose 2.87 per cent to close at $160.12.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 had set intraday and closing record highs earlier this year.US stocks have also been somewhat rangebound as investors readied for the Fed to move and concerns mounted over valuations.A narrower pace of tightening than expected in March has helped alleviate some of those concerns. Strategists with Wells Fargo note that despite a heightened sense of nervousness by investors, “the bull market likely remains intact”.“Nervousness is rather normal around the first Fed tightening,” said Gina Martin Adams, a strategist with the bank. “Nervousness is also usually rather scarce at the time of bull market peaks.”Two flotations were also well received by the market, with shares of Fitbit and Univar climbing. Shares of the fitness tracking device maker soared 52 per cent to $30.40 in their debut, lifting the company’s valuation to $6.2bn. Fitbit closed at $29.68.Univar, which sold shares on Wednesday at $22 apiece, gained 15.45 per cent to $25.40.Shares of Oracle slid 7 per cent to $41.56 midday after the software maker said profits fell by nearly a quarter to $2.8bn as a strengthening dollar cut into sales. Oracle closed at $42.74.Oracle, which offers database and cloud products for companies, said overall sales fell 5 per cent from a year earlier to $10.7bn in the three months to the end of May, attributing roughly $900m in lost revenues to the dollar.The company reported adjusted earnings of 78 cents a share, short of analyst expectations for 87 cents.Overall, markets advanced on strengthening economic data, as initial jobless claims declined by a better than expected pace and an index of manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region hit its highest level of the year.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both climbed 0.9 per cent to close at 2,120.88 and 18,113.84 respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1.29 per cent to 1,284.68.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
8;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Vertex climbs on drug approval hopes;US stocks edge higher after two days of declines;Vertex Pharmaceuticals led an advance by US biotechnology companies, buoyed by analyst commentary that one of its lead drug candidates could be approved by US regulators sooner than anticipated as well as by an unexpected bidding war for one of its peers.Analysts with Wells Fargo say the company’s near term earnings could be lifted by early approval of its treatment for cystic fibrosis, which completed two phase three trials last June and was submitted for regulatory approval in November.The drug, Lumacaftor, could be used in treatment in approximately 22,000 people in North America, Australia and Europe and analysts say annual sales could eclipse $5bn. Some 75,000 people in those regions suffer from cystic fibrosis, which congests the lungs and has no cure.On November 5, Vertex submitted its plans to the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, and was subsequently granted priority review which shortened the FDA’s anticipated assessment time from 12 months to eight.“Early approval would have a meaningful positive impact on near-term earnings per share,” said Brian Abrahams, an analyst with Wells Fargo.“We calculate that for every month earlier than the July 5 [Prescription Drug User Fee Act] date that Kalydeco/809 is approved, there would be a $0.26 positive impact on Vertex’s non-GAAP earnings per share.”Vertex shares climbed 6 per cent to $126.96, placing it among the top-performing companies within the S&P 500.The broader healthcare sector was lifted by news that AbbVie had swooped in to purchase Pharmacyclics, a maker of a potential blockbuster cancer medication, for $21bn, outbidding rival Johnson & Johnson.Large pharmaceutical companies have turned to merger and acquisition activity in a bid to improve their drug pipelines, helping provide double-digit gains for the biotechnology sector for the past six years.The Nasdaq biotech index climbed 2 per cent to 3,639.10. Shares of Bluebird Bio rose 12 per cent to $112.23, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals climbed 2 per cent to $8.25 and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals advanced 4 per cent to $428.95.Costco shares increased 3 per cent to $151.17 after the wholesale US retailer eclipsed financial second-quarter earnings expectations.The retailer, known to sell extra virgin olive oil and baby diapers in bulk, said sales rose 4 per cent to $27.5bn.Profits advanced 29 per cent to $598m, or $1.35 a share, in the three months to February 15. Analysts on Wall Street had expected the company to report earnings of $1.18 a share on sales of $27.7bn.Shares of Dunkin Donuts advanced 3 per cent to $46.49 after analysts with Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral” and raised their price target to $54 from $47.Analysts said the doughnut chain should be able to hurdle lower same-store sales estimates this year after comparable sales misses in 2014, putting “relative valuations near all-time lows”.Overall, US stocks climbed after two days of declines as policy makers with the European Central Bank left benchmark interest rates unchanged and said its bond buying programme would begin next week.The S&P 500 climbed 0.1 per cent to 2,101.04 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.2 per cent to 18,135.72.

9;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;US investors double down on biotech bets;Advances in innovation help sector add to 2014 gains, bucking wider January sell-off;Investors in US equities confronted with a volatile market so far this month are returning to one of their favoured trades of recent years: betting on biotech.Having risen 100 per cent over the preceding two years, biotechs have maintained their ability to outperform the broad S&P 500. Already this month the Nasdaq biotech index has risen 5.7 per cent, rebounding from a sell-off during December and adding more than $40bn to its market cap, compared with the broader S&P 500 which is little changed.The leadership by biotechs reflects how companies in the sector sit at the cutting edge of potential medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs, promising huge rewards for investors. In a low-growth environment biotechs are seen by investors as one of the few sectors that can deliver compelling opportunities.After four years of double-digit gains for the sector and five years when it has finished ahead of the benchmark S&P 500, Wall Street believes the biotech boom can continue.“We have witnessed significant innovation in the biotech industry over the early part of this decade, highlighted by cures in hepatitis C and transformative advances in prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis and numerous orphan diseases,” said Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst with Barclays.“Rather than signalling a period of innovation lag, we believe we are still in the early-to-middle innings of a wave of innovation.”The bank also expects brisk earnings growth and projects a 19 per cent rise in large-cap biotech earnings this year, compared with an 8 per cent advance by the S&P 500 and an 11 per cent rise by healthcare, given drug launches and a slate of trials.But risks remain high, particularly for smaller companies awaiting data from trials and for looming drug launches. Goldman Sachs noted that expectations for some upcoming debuts varied greatly, which could present a hurdle for stocks. Forecasts for Vertex’s much-anticipated cystic fibrosis treatment range between a low of $1.3bn and a high of $2.8bn in 2016, which could represent three-quarters of the company’s overall sales.Rather than signalling a period of innovation lag, we believe we are still in the early-to-middle innings of a wave of innovationThe potential for lower payouts from pharmacy benefit managers and a rotation into other sectors of the market could also dent the biotech bull run.“Any sector that has had a three year-plus run like biotech, the risk grows as correlations between stocks grow,” says Matthew Harrison, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “A speed bump for one of the major biotechs appears to have significant sector implications.”Market valuations of three stalwarts of the industry — Biogen Idec, Gilead and Regeneron — have more than doubled over the past two years. New treatments, including Gilead’s blockbuster Sovaldi and Harvoni hepatitis C medications, have proved a fillip. Wall Street expects the latter to generate sales of $39.6bn between 2015 and 2017.The soaring valuations of the largest biotech companies are not particularly troublesome, according to analysts with Barclays and Morgan Stanley, who point to metrics such as price/earnings and equity value-to-sales ratios. The Nasdaq biotech index trades with a p/e of 42.7 times expected 2015 results, below the 72.6 level recorded in 2012 but far above that of the S&P 500, data from Bloomberg show.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
10;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2014-07-27T20:00:33Z;Hepatitis C researchers battle to ‘nuke’ the competition;Search for improved therapies intensifies;Idenix has fewer than 100 employees and no products on the market. So what was it that persuaded Merck to pay $3.85bn – more than triple Idenix’s market capitalisation before the deal – to buy the Boston-based biotech company in June?The answers lay in Idenix’s portfolio of experimental treatments for hepatitis C, widening Merck’s arsenal in the battle for supremacy over one of the hottest areas of drug development.Little doubt exists over who leads the race. Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi medicine had sales of $5.8bn in its in its first six months on the market this year, a record for a drug launch.Gilead’s success has encouraged a cluster of other companies to step up their pursuit of therapies for a condition affecting 150m people worldwide. Analysts say the market could be worth up to $20bn a year by the decade’s end.Along with Merck, others in the chasing pack include AbbVie, Achillion, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson. While the burst of innovation around hepatitis C has stoked debate over pricing because of the $1,000-a-day cost of Sovaldi, it is an example of strong commercial incentives driving medical breakthroughs.The rush of new drugs promises to transform treatment of a disease for which previous therapies had low success rates and unpleasant side effects.“The development of direct-acting antiviral agents has revolutionised hepatitis C treatment by offering genuine prospects for the first comprehensive cure of a chronic viral infection in humans,” say Harvard liver specialists Raymond Chung and Thomas Baumert in the New England Journal of Medicine. “It may now be possible to imagine the global eradication of chronic hepatitis C.”Previously, patients faced up to a year of medication on a pill called ribavirin and injections of interferon, which boost the immune response to hepatitis C but cause flu-like symptoms.Direct-acting antiviral agents offer prospects for comprehensive cureMany people failed to complete the course. Even for those who did, the success rate was less than half in cases involving genotype one – the hardest-to-treat form of the disease – and no more than 80 per cent for other genotypes.A step forward came from 2011 with the new so-called protease inhibitors from Merck, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and, more recently, Janssen, part of Johnson & Johnson. These drugs, taken in combination with ribavirin and interferon, nudged cure rates up significantly but the nasty side effects remained.The big breakthrough came in December with the US regulatory approval of Sovaldi. The outcome was treatment time down to as little as 12 weeks with success rates of above 90 per cent – even for those with genotype one. Sovaldi, also known as sofosbuvir, is the first of a generation of hepatitis C drugs called nucleotide analogue inhibitors, or “nukes”.Gilead’s medicine still leaves room for improvement, however, because many patients must still take it together with interferon. The race is on to develop the first “nuke” that eliminates the need for injections and older drugs altogether.Analysts say Gilead remains in the lead, with the US Food and Drug Administration expected to rule by October on its application for a once-a-day, all-oral pill combining Sovaldi with another new medicine called ledipasvir.Others are scrambling to catch-up. AbbVie, for example, filed in April for FDA approval of an interferon-free combination, including an experimental “nuke” that cured more than 90 per cent of patients in trials. Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb have revealed some strong trial data this year.Many doctors, meanwhile, have ditched interferon by prescribing Sovaldi with Janssen’s Olysio protease inhibitor, even though the combination is not officially approved by the FDA.“If you have to have Hepatitis C, now is the time to have it,” says Douglas Dieterich, a liver specialist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.“We have these marvellous drugs we can treat you with right now, without side effects,” he adds. “And this time next year, we’ll have another round of drugs available.”The revolution in hepatitis C drugs has not been without setbacks and controversy. In addition to the political furore over pricing, Sovaldi is the subject of several patent disputes. AbbVie and Merck are among those to have challenged Gilead’s rights to some of the intellectual property behind the drug.Safety has been a concern. Bristol-Myers Squibb wrote off $1.8bn in acquisition and development costs after a patient died and others were admitted to hospital during trials of a nuke it was developing in 2012, leading to the drug being abandoned. Idenix, Vertex and Achillion have been slowed down by worries over toxicity.Analysts say it is still uncertain which company will emerge with the most effective and safest drug cocktail. This explains why Merck was prepared to take a gamble on Idenix to boost its range of combination options.Progress in tackling hepatitis C is as welcome for drugmakers as it is for patients.After a long period of sluggish growth and productivity, Sovaldi’s success has shown that the industry is capable of powerful financial returns when it produces true innovation.But Mark Purcell, analyst at Barclays, cautions that not everyone will be a winner in an increasingly competitive market where “economic returns might not meet increasingly high expectations.”

Some 75,000 people in those regions suffer from cystic fibrosis, which congests the lungs and has no cure.Goldman Sachs estimates the drug could tally sales above $5bn a year at its peak. Vertex plans to submit applications for US and European regulatory approval and expects to launch the treatment some time in 2015.The Boston-based company’s market capitalisation jumped by $6.5bn overnight to more than $22bn as shares climbed 40.41 per cent to close at $93.53.The news lifted the broader sector as well. The Nasdaq Biotech index climbed 1 per cent to 2,668.28.Unexpected optimism on the corporate PC market from US chipmaker Intel two weeks ago may not have been a one-off for the sector.Micron Technology, the largest US maker of flash memory, said it would increase production of dynamic-random access memory, which is mostly used in PCs.Micron will also ramp up production of Nand flash chips, which are used mainly for tablets and smartphones.The guidance came as the company said sales in the three months to May 29 soared 72 per cent from a year earlier to $4bn, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Profits rose more than 18-fold to $806m, or 68 cents a share.The company has been lifted by stable prices and steady supply, after years of market turmoil. Micron acquired Japanese semiconductor manufacturer Elpida Memory in 2013, helping to drive a wave of consolidation.Shares of Micron, which have outpaced the broader benchmark S&P 500 since the beginning of the year, rose 3.97 per cent to $32.50. Intel climbed 0.89 per cent to $30.50.Lorillard and Reynolds American were under pressure after broker Morgan Stanley cut its ratings on the cigarette makers to underweight from equal-weight, saying a potential tie-up was already priced into shares.Lorillard shares fell 1.98 per cent to $62.27, Reynolds American declined 1.36 per cent to $60.94 and Altria dipped 0.80 per cent to $42.35.Walgreens declined 1.70 per cent to $72.48 after the drugstore chain said sales and profits in the three months to the end of May came up short of Wall Street estimates. Revenues climbed to $19.4bn from $18.3bn, while profits rose to $722m from $624m.Overall, US equities shifted higher following better than expected housing and consumer confidence reports, though early gains later faded. The figures showed new home sales in May hit their fastest pace since 2008, rising 18.6 per cent to an annualised pace of 504,000 units.“Net net, two economic numbers today each pulling in the same direction, convincing evidence that the economy continues to expand after a sharp drop in the first quarter,” Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist Chris Rupkey said.The S&P 500 slipped 0.64 per cent to 1,949.98 after hitting a new record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.70 per cent lower to 16,818.13.

If the offering is completed, it would represent one of the largest initial public offerings in history.Some analysts on Wall Street have speculated the company could be valued at as much as $200bn.The potential effect on its valuation as a consequence of the latest results pinned back Yahoo shares 6 per cent to $34.81, after a recent rally on high expectations.Merger activity also dominated Monday trading. Shares in Medtronic, the medical device maker, fell 1.1 per cent to $60.03 after it agreed to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc for $42.9bn. Shares in Covidien were up 20 per cent to $86.75.Williams Companies shares also climbed 19 per cent to $56.02, providing another large lift to the S&P 500. The pipeline operator has agreed to acquire control of Access Midstream Partners LP for $5.99bn.Level 3 Communications lost 4 per cent after it said it would buy Internet services provider TW Telecom for $40.86 per share in a cash and stock deal. TW Telecom gained 7 per cent to $38.85.In further deals-related moves, Fusion-io surged 22 per cent to $11.36, giving it a market capitalisation of $1.2bn, after agreeing to be acquired by SanDisk for just under that amount.SanDisk is a veteran manufacturer of flash storage and Fusion-io is something of a young upstart -developing flash technology that gives faster performance than conventional hard drives when used by computers in network data centres.Its chief scientist, however, is a household name – Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.SanDisk is offering $11.25 for each Fusion-io share and the $1.1bn deal, which is net of cash assumed, is expected to close in the third quarter.SanDisk shares rose 4 per cent to $102.00 by close on Monday, valuing the company at $23bn.Sanjay Mehrotra, SanDisk president and chief executive officer, said Fusion-io would accelerate its efforts “to enable the flash-transformed data centre, helping companies better manage increasingly heavy data workloads at a lower total cost of ownership”.Shares in Vertex Pharmaceuticals fell 9 per cent to $67.12 on concerns about the company’s experimental drug to treat cystic fibrosis, VX809. Monday’s decline puts the stock down 16 per cent from year ago levels.Wells Fargo senior analyst Brian Abrahams said that the weakness was “based on revisited concerns about risk” going into forthcoming readouts on the drug, known as Lumacaftor, and “some caution apparently being expressed by scientists at the ongoing European Cystic Fibrosis Society conference in Sweden”.“We note these concerns are not new, and experts at our CF symposium earlier this year noted there are many variables that make it difficult to draw conclusions based solely on this,” Mr Abrahams said in a note.However, analysts at Bernstein said after attending the conference that the “probability of failure is high, and is under-appreciated by the investment community.”“More than ever there seems to be a disconnect between the assumptions and expectations of the investor community and that of the medical community involved in the trial,” said Geoffrey Porges, putting a $65 target price on the stock.Overall, US equities started the week little changed, despite better than expected industrial production, regional manufacturing and homebuilder sentiment data.“Today’s figures are evidence of a strengthening recovery of the economy,” said Chris Rupkey, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist. “Fed policy is behind the curve if industrial production was the one desert-island statistic on the Fed’s dashboard guiding monetary policy.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 5 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 16,781.01, the S&P 500 lost 2 points to 1,937.78 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.24 per cent to 4,321.11.
13;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2020-04-24T07:29:19+0000;Senator requests SEC investigate Vertex;;A US senator has asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch an investigation to determine if executives from Vertex Pharmaceuticals illegally sold stock after realising that results of an important clinical drug trial were overstated.In early May, shares of Vertex jumped 55 per cent when it reported strong results of a clinical trial on a cystic fibrosis drug. The company hopes the drug will be approved for the general adult population by the US Food and Drug Administration and Wall Street analysts expect the treatment to generate strong sales.However, three weeks later Vertex reported that there was an error in the results and that the drug was not as effective as the company originally reported. The announcement caused shares of Vertex to plunge.Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, wrote in a letter to Mary Schapiro, SEC chairman, noting that between the two announcements, five Vertex executives and two directors sold millions of dollars of shares.“It could appear that these Vertex executives potentially took advantage of the spike in the stock knowing the news of the clinical data being overstated would be made public eventually, which in turn would negatively affect the stock value,” Mr Grassley wrote.Vertex said its executives did nothing wrong and that any shares sold were in accord with they company’s policy.“After learning late on Friday, May 25 of new information regarding the CF combination study, we moved quickly to disclose the new data before the market opened on the next business day,” said Zach Barber, a Vertex spokesman. “All shares sold by our executives and directors were either part of pre-existing 10B5-1 plans or followed Vertex’s internal stock trading policy.”Mr Grassley asked the SEC to respond to his request by June 28. Shares of Vertex fell 1.85 per cent to $56.77 on Thursday.
14;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2012-05-07T18:07:23Z;Cystic fibrosis drugs: strong combo;Vertex therapy could be multibillion-dollar product;You wouldn’t know it from big pharma’s sagging productivity but drug research sometimes leads to drug discoveries. Just look at the shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which rose by almost half on Monday morning, adding $3.8bn to the capitalisation of the company.The leap followed interim results from Vertex’s combination therapy for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder afflicting about 70,000 people globally. CF patents endure life-threatening lung congestion. The results came from just 37 patients treated with Vertex’s drugs Kalydeco and VX-809, but improvement in lung function far exceeded expectations. Kalydeco is already approved for patients with one of the rarer mutations behind the disease. The present study looked at a more common mutation, and raises hopes that most CF patients could ultimately benefit from the drugs.The drug combo will probably sell at a very high price. In its currently approved indication, Kalydeco alone sells for nearly $300,000 a year. At a price anywhere near that level, the combo could be a multibillion-dollar product, even if a minority of CF patients ultimately take it. And there is limited competition in CF. Only one other company, PTC Therapeutics, has a late-stage compound aimed at the diseases’ genetic causes – and it focuses on a different mutation type.Coincidentally, news of Vertex’s success came on the same day that Roche announced it would abandon its studies of a drug aimed at a massive population, those with low “good cholesterol”. More evidence of another change: the growth opportunities in pharma are coming more from severe but rare diseases. Big pharma understands this trend – consider Sanofi’s acquisition of Genzyme last year – but must continue to adopt research programmes, acquisition strategies and sales forces to the new reality.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
15;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Amylin jumps 50% on talk of failed bid;;Shares in Amylin Pharmaceuticals rose more than 50 per cent on Wednesday on reports of a spurned $3.5bn takeover bid for the US diabetic-focused medicines group last month from Bristol-Myers Squibb, rekindling the prospect of acquisitions in the biotechnology sector.The unsolicited offer of $22 a share – reported on Bloomberg but on which the two companies refused to comment – comes at a time of fresh debate over the need for pharmaceuticals groups to reinvigorate their pipelines of experimental medicines.Bernstein Research said the deal highlighted that Amylin’s apparent rejection of a bid left open the option of a rival offer from AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swedish group that has suffered a series of recent late-stage experimental drug failures.Bernstein placed a similar valuation of about $3.5bn on Amylin, while saying the in effect price would probably be higher after taking into account the US group’s promissory notes and convertible debt. Shares in Amylin rose $8.38 to $23.77 at the close in New York.Bristol-Myers Squibb, like AstraZeneca, has spurned a broader industry trend to diversify more aggressively beyond pure innovative medicines. Analysts have argued that they need to expand their scale in the diabetes sector, dominated by Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk.Amylin developed a series of medicines for diabetics, and in late 2011 concluded litigation that had overshadowed a decade-long commercial partnership with Eli Lilly, acquiring back full rights to its drug exenatide in exchange for payments to total $1.2bn plus interest over the coming years. It has partnerships with Alkermes, Takeda and Biocon.Bernstein said in a note: “We continue to believe that [AstraZeneca] is actively pursuing midsized target companies in the biopharmaceutical space … It needs late-stage/approved assets to help fill in the gaps left open by a lagging pipeline and ongoing future patent expiries.”It also highlighted the potential for co-operation following a takeover of Amylin, pointing out that AstraZeneca already has a partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb in diabetes. “Layering [Amylin’s] products … into this existing franchise would be easy.”AstraZeneca has been among a number of large pharmaceuticals groups expressing interest in strengthening its future operations through acquisitions while expressing doubt over the wisdom of “mega-mergers” with other large companies.Bernstein listed other potential midsize targets for AstraZeneca as Regeneron, UCB, Actelion, Vertex and Forest, all with market capitalisations of less than $10bn.
16;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2011-11-21T22:06:54Z;Gilead acquires Pharmasset for $11bn;;Gilead, the US pharmaceutical company, has agreed to buy Pharmasset in an $11bn cash deal designed to diversify away from HIV drugs and give it a lead in the fast-growing market for hepatitis C medicines.The deal, Gilead’s largest acquisition to date, values Pharmasset at $137 a share, an 89 per cent premium above its closing share price on Friday, and a 59 per cent premium to its all-time high closing price. It far exceeds Gilead’s previous acquisitions, including Myogen, bought for $2.5bn in 2006 and CV Therapeutics, bought for $1.4bn in 2009.Gilead shares closed down 9.08 per cent at $36.26 on concern the price was too high for a company not expected to generate profits for two years. Pharmasset’s shares rose 84.59 per cent to $134.14“While we understand the strategic rationale, the price tag is lofty for a pre-commercial asset and not aligned with what we would like to see from Gilead in terms of capital allocation,” said Joshua Schimmer, an analyst at Leerink Swann.Pharmasset is developing oral drugs for hepatitis C, which Gilead expects to become important as patients switch from existing inconvenient therapies which must be taken more regularly, require injection and have significant side effects.The purchase – one of the largest in the drugs sector in recent months – will strengthen the company’s position in the fast-developing field and reflects a strategy it has used to become one of the leading producers of HIV treatments, including tenofovir.“The acquisition of Pharmasset represents an important and exciting opportunity to accelerate Gilead’s effort to change the treatment paradigm for HCV-infected patients by developing all-oral regimens for the treatment of the disease regardless of viral genotype,” said John Martin, Gilead’s chief executive.A number of leading drug companies are investing heavily in the treatment of hepatitis C as the market moves towards a once-a-day oral cure, rather than the cocktail of medicines currently used to control the disease. Merck, Roche, Johnson & Johnson and Vertex are among those targeting the market.Hepatitis C is a viral disease that causes the liver to swell. Gilead said estimated global HCV prevalence was 160m people, including 12m infected in major markets, while only 200,000 patients are currently treated. According to the US National Institute of Health, the disease affects about 1.5 per cent of the US population.The deal consolidates Gilead’s own hepatitis treatments with two approved medicines and a further half a dozen in its pipeline. Pharmasset has three hepatitis C drugs undergoing clinical trials, including one in a partnership with Roche. Schaefer Price, the company’s chief executive, said Gilead’s marketing and antiviral drug development expertise would make the acquisition a good fit.The company said the deal would be dilutive to earnings until 2014 and accretive from the following year. It will temporarily suspend its share repurchases and fund the transaction with cash and additional borrowings.Les Funtleyder, an analyst and fund manager at Miller Tabak, said some investors find the deal risky because it is dependent on the success of clinical trials. “Many people are reading this as an act of desperation for Gilead, meaning that maybe their pipeline wasn’t really so great,” Mr Funtleyder said.Barclays Capital and Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Gilead on the deal and provided $6.2bn in new debt financing. Morgan Stanley advised Pharmasset.
17;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Gilead-Pharmasset: side effects;Acquisition has considerable advantages in spite of its mind-boggling price;Here’s a phrase Gilead shareholders probably did not particularly enjoy reading on Monday morning, in the press release about their company’s $11bn acquisition of Pharmasset: “accretive in 2015 and beyond.” The “and beyond” bit is especially dispiriting. When a company spends the equivalent of a third of its enterprise value, and for its money will not get an actual marketed product for at least three years, the effects are predictable – Gilead’s stock fell by more than a 10th.But holders of Gilead stock should have known what they were in for. Here is a company with $5bn in gross cash on its balance sheet, 50 per cent operating margins and excellent cash flow, but which depends on a portfolio of drugs for HIV with slowing sales growth and patents beginning to expire in the middle of this decade. These drugs are simply too big to replace with internally developed products. Something had to be done.The Pharmasset acquisition, despite its mind-boggling price tag, is not simply a desperate or overpriced deal. It has considerable advantages. The market for hepatitis C drugs, on which Pharmasset focuses, is huge (9m patients in the US and European Union alone) and under-penetrated. Most patients are undiagnosed, untreated, or both. US rival Vertex sold $420m of its hepatitis C product in the most recent quarter – which it only launched in May. The potential helps offset two big risks: that a side-effect problem for the main pipeline product, PSI-7977, shows up in late-stage trials, and that one of the hundreds of hepatitis C drugs now in development is even better than 7977’s impressive clinical results. It is hard to assess the balance of risk and reward in Gilead’s gamble. The salient point for investors in all maturing pharma and biotech companies is how high the stakes are for any company that wants to stay in the game.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
18;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2011-05-17T20:52:31Z;Roche and Merck tie up on hepatitis treatment;;Roche has formed a partnership with its US rival Merck to commercialise and develop worldwide the treatments and diagnostics for Hepatitis C.The Swiss pharmaceuticals company said it would initially co-market in the US Merck’s treatment Victrelis, known generically as boceprevir, alongside its own drug Pegasys and its related diagnostic PaqMan.Separately, the two companies will in future agree to share the costs of clinical trials testing combinations of their experimental Hepatitis C medicines, reflecting the need to use a “cocktail” of different drugs for effective treatment.Chronic Hepatitis C is a serious viral infection estimated to affect more than 3m Americans and killing 12,000 a year.Studies suggest a significant proportion of patients can be cured using a triple combination, such as the two companies’ drugs plus an off-patent drug called ribavirin.The Merck-Roche partnership represents the latest in a series of intensifying efforts by drug companies to share the costs and risks of medicine development, and moves to share the costs of marketing.It follows the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration last week of Victrelis, which Merck has said it plans to sell in the US for a wholesale price of $1,100 per week, with treatment typically lasting up to 44 weeks. It has applied for regulatory approval in Europe.The deal comes at a time when investors have expressed doubts over the value of Merck’s own equivalent of Pegasys, called Peg-Intron. The tie-up strengthens the US company’s potential in the market for Hepatitis C ahead of the expected launch of a competitor from Vertex Pharmaceuticals, analysts said.“With Roche on board, this potential shortcoming [with Peg-Intron] gets more than removed, in our opinion,” said Bernstein in a research note.GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer have created a joint venture called ViiV Healthcare for the development and marketing of all their combined HIV treatments, and Gilead has similar partnerships for HIV medicines with companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb.Merck maintains a development and marketing partnership for vaccines in Europe with Sanofi-Aventis, and until the recent collapse of talks it was planning a renewal of Merial, its long-standing partnership with the French pharmaceuticals company for animal health products.Merck has unveiled previous cost-sharing experimental drugs development partnerships, notably for cancer drugs with AstraZeneca, reflecting the need for combinations of different therapies.
19;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2010-11-03T00:37:37Z;Doctor faces insider trading charges;;"US prosecutors on Tuesday arrested a French doctor for allegedly engaging in insider trading by leaking confidential information on a clinical drug trial to a hedge fund that allowed it to avoid losses of $30m.In their complaint, US officials said Yves Benhamou, a doctor at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, broke securities laws by sharing with a hedge fund manager in 2007-08 negative findings on a clinical test of Albuferon, an experimental drug to treat Hepatitis C then being developed by Human Genome Sciences.While the complaint does not name the investment firm or the individual manager who received confidential information from Dr Benhamou, people familiar with the matter identified the fund as FrontPoint Partners. Morgan Stanley, which bought FrontPoint about four years ago, recently agreed to reduce its stake in the $7bn fund.“We are co-operating fully with this investigation,” a FrontPoint spokesman said. “We have placed Dr Chip Skowron on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. We have no further comment at this time.”Dr Skowron, co-portfolio manager of the FrontPoint Health Care Fund, did not return a call or e-mail seeking comment. The complaint, filed by the US Attorney’s Manhattan office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, claims Dr Benhamou was a member of the HGS steering committee overseeing the trial, but also received consulting fees from the hedge fund, which, it is claimed, sold its 6m HGS shares after his tip-off and ahead of public disclosure that cut HGS’s price by 44 per cent.Preet Bharara, US attorney, noted that the investigation was continuing. The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed civil charges against Dr Benhamou.The case highlights the potential for abuse of commercially sensitive data generated by quoted drug companies, which is shared by a network of external medical advisers ahead of market disclosure.Hedge funds and financial analysts frequently seek to tap medical experts in efforts to assess the likelihood of drugs in development making it to the market, as new drugs offer the prospect of billions of dollars in revenue for the pharmaceutical companies – or even the collapse of smaller biotech businesses if a drug proves unviable.Dr Benhamou is listed in public filings as a consultant to other drug companies including Abbott; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Gilead; GlaxoSmithKline; Idenix Pharmaceuticals; Roche; Valeant; and Vertex.Dr Benhamou, who was arrested on a trip to Boston, will be held in custody ahead of his transfer for a court hearing in New York.Alongside charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, the SEC said it was seeking “disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a financial penalty”."
20;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2009-07-12T23:12:30Z;Morgan Stanley unveils $250m securitisation;;Morgan Stanley has launched a new intellectual property securitisation in the latest sign of life for structured products and a revival of investor interest in even the most cutting-edge corners of the market.The bank has launched a $250m deal for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a US biotech company that would see investors repaid from contractual milestone payments on a drug still in development.Most observers expect these particular deals to remain an exotic area of the markets but say that their presence is another sign that the basic principles of asset-backed borrowing are still alive.The return of securitisation, one of the first sectors of the markets to seize up in the summer of 2007, is considered crucial to the economic recovery because of its pivotal role in allowing banks to lend more by helping them transfer some of the risks off their books.Last month Tesco, the UK supermarket giant, raised £430m ($697m) in the first commercial mortgage-backed bond since the credit crisis began.Deals based on so-called intangible assets such as intellectual property are similar to straightforward securitisations such as the Tesco deal in that the issuer is borrowing against ring-fenced cash flows from specified assets. But the deals are very esoteric since each depends on the exact assets involved and the reliability of those particular cash flows.Musicians have used the structure to borrow against royalty payments from their back catalogues while Walt Disney has borrowed against its theme park gate receipts. Before the financial crisis, private equity firms were increasingly securitising intangibles to help fund buy-outs including those of Hertz and Dunkin Donuts.Morgan Stanley bankers have been quietly working on similar drug-based deals since 2004. This will be the 18th. The team even managed five deals in 2008 but they were all completed before Lehman Brothers’ collapse rocked the markets.“We think other holders of royalties will start to avail themselves of this technology and the rationale,” said Thomas Cahill, co-head of Morgan Stanley’s structured products group. “The products are bespoke, but we believe there are enough investors prepared to do their own homework for the deals to become more common.”Companies like the deals because they get to keep the assets – and any upside from other sales and licence agreements – and do not have to dilute their equity. Nor do they have to bear the risk if the drug fails because the deal is structured in a special purpose vehicle with no recourse to the actual company.For investors the attraction is high yields – the deals often carry double-digit coupons – and the chance to own assets that are not closely correlated with other asset classes or the wider economic outlook.
21;VRTX;Vertex Pharmaceutic;2008-08-13T20:59:44Z;Genentech rejects $44bn offer by Roche;;Genentech on Wednesday rejected an unsolicited $43.7bn takeover bid from its majority owner Roche but suggested it would consider a higher offer.The US group, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, said Roche’s $89 per share bid “substantially undervalues” its business.However, it said a special committee of board members would consider a proposal that “recognises the value of the company and reflects the significant benefits that would accrue to Roche as a result of full ownership.”Switzerland’s Roche, which already owns 56 per cent of Genentech, made the bid to buy out the company’s minority shareholders public on July 21, ending years of speculation over whether it would attempt to bring Genentech fully into the fold.Wall Street analysts had broadly expected Genentech to refuse Roche at the current price, which represented a premium of 9 per cent to the price at which Genentech’s shares closed before the bid was announced.Merger dealmakers say it is likely Roche and Genentech will negotiate over a deal at a higher price, in order to keep the climate surrounding the drugmakers and their critically-important scientists and other employees from growing frigid.Shares of Genentech closed up by 0.5 per cent at $98.37 on Wednesday, reflecting investors’ expectations for a new bid at or above that level.Throughout the nearly 20 years it has owned a majority of Genentech, Roche has long maintained that the companies’ partnership, rather than a full merger, provided an ideal operating platform.Genentech has consistently boosted Roche’s financial results, and it developed many of Roche’s most successful drugs, including blockbuster cancer treatments Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin.The two companies’ businesses have started to overlap – and at points, compete – more significantly in recent years, however. Roche has said a deal to buy the remainder of Genentech could save $750m-$850m a year.Roche’s about-face, combined with Bristol-Myers’ bid for the rest of its partner ImClone, is now sparking debate over whether other drugmakers that partner with smaller companies on key ventures will enact mergers.These include Eli Lilly and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals and Johnson & Johnson and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.
