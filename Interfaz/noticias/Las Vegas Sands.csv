0;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2018-09-19T18:17:47Z;Casino stocks rise as hedge funds roll the dice on sector;;Casino stocks climbed higher on Wednesday amid media speculation of growing interest in the sector from activist hedge funds.Investors appeared to have latched on to a late-Tuesday report from the New York Post that Starboard Value, the hedge fund trying to shake things up at cyber security company Symantec and consumer goods company Newell Brands, has taken a “sizeable position” of more than $500m, in MGM Resorts International and was pushing for major changes.However, Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported this morning that Starboard Value does not own shares of MGM and had no economic exposure to the stock, but said that a representative of the fund had declined to comment.HG Vora, another hedge fund, revealed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday it had taken a stake in Caesars Entertainment. The NY Post reported last week, citing sources, that HG Vora would push for changes at the company which operates the Harrah’s and Horseshoe casino brands.HG Vora also holds a stake in MGM, as do other hedge funds including Canyon Capital, Soroban Capital Partners and Eminence Capital.MGM shares were up 3.1 per cent in afernoon trade, while Caesars Entertainment was up 0.7 per cent, Wynn Resorts added 2.6 per cent and Las Vegas Sands rose 0.8 per centShares in all four companies are down by double-digits this year amid investor concerns that revenues from Las Vegas were looking weak. Caesars had said it expected the summer could be soft owing to unusually light business from conventions and a lack of blockbuster events over the period such as the Conor McGregor/Floyd Mayweather boxing match last year.That is on top of concerns that the trade war between the US and China could hurt Chinese consumer spending and shrink revenues in Macau, which is the world’s biggest gambling centre.This story has been updated from an earlier version to reflect the conflicting media reports.
1;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2018-06-01T15:42:38Z;Casino stocks fall as Macau gaming revenue disappoints;;Shares of US-listed casinos that operate in Macau fell on Friday after the world’s largest gambling hub reported lower-than-expected revenues last month.Shares in Melco Resorts & Entertainment fell 2.42 per cent, Wynn Resorts shares dropped 1.72 per cent, and Las Vegas Sands shares dipped 0.71 per cent at around 11:15am in New York.Macau on Friday said gaming revenues rose 12.1 per cent to 25.5bn patacas ($3.2bn) in May, well below the 16 to 20 per cent growth analysts had expected.The disappointing revenue still marked 22 consecutive months of growth after Beijing’s anti-corruption crackdown in 2014 spooked high rollers from mainland China, and dealt a blow to the island’s gaming revenue for more than two years.Macau in recent years has been challenged by its neighbours like Singapore, the Philippines and Japan, which is working on easing gambling regulations after legalising casinos in 2016. Operators like Wynn and Melco, which already has a casino in Manila, are looking to enter Japan.
2;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2018-05-14T15:02:07Z;UK bookmakers surge on US sports betting ruling;;Investors rushed to take a punt on gambling stocks on Monday following a landmark court ruling that could pave the way for legalised sports gambling in the US.Shares in UK bookmaker William Hill, which has been expanding aggressively in the US, surged nearly 9 per cent after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that bans sports gambling. The decision is expected to open the door for states to allow betting on college and professional sports.GVC Holdings, which owns the high street betting shop Ladbrokes Coral in the UK as well as online gambling sites Bwin, Sportingbet, PartyPoker and Foxy Bingo, jumped 5.2 per cent.Paddy Power Betfair, another UK bookmaker that has designs on the vast US market, ripped 10.6 per cent higher.Among US gambling stocks, Churchill Downs, which owns five racetracks and six casinos, was up 3.9 per cent at $289.75Las Vegas-centric operators were the main outlier, however, given that the ruling is expected to break the city’s hold on sports betting. Wynn Resorts fell 1.8 per cent to $192.33 while Las Vegas Sands dropped 0.7 per cent to $77.55.
3;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2018-03-11T04:29:23Z;Japan’s Abe poised to raise stakes in casinos gambit;Coalition parties meet to negotiate gambling law after 15 years of corporate lobbying;International gaming operators could reap the rewards of 15 years of lobbying, as Japan’s ruling coalition parties meet this week to discuss new rules that could pave the way for the country’s first casinos.The ruling Liberal Democratic party will propose granting casino licences to as many as six Japanese cities, said people within the government and gaming industry.That would raise the stakes in a battle between the party of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and its Komeito coalition partner, which is likely to counter that the number of casino licences available be just two — a position that reflects its more conservative view on gambling, said people briefed on its agenda.Companies such as MGM Resorts International, Las Vegas Sands and Caesars Entertainment have long eyed Japan as one of the world’s richest prizes— potentially becoming the second biggest gaming market after Macau. Industry projections suggest that revenues in the country could hit $15bn a year, while analysts have put the value at closer to $25bn, assuming multiple resorts open across the country. Industry executives say that even if Mr Abe’s proposal is rejected or downsized, the government’s move to potentially grant a number of licences in the first wave will have a profound effect on the operators positioning themselves to enter the market.“The operators had been expecting to compete in at most two all-or-nothing beauty parades for the first licences, but could now find themselves in a more strategic chase around regional Japan,” said an executive from one Las Vegas-based company, who was confident that casinos would be lucrative both in or outside Japan’s biggest metropolitan centres.If the broader licence plan is approved, the first wave of casino-centric “integrated resorts” could appear in Nagasaki, Tomakomai, on the northern island of Hokkaido, and Fukuoka, as well as the larger metropolises of Osaka, Yokohama and Tokyo. In some cities, particularly Osaka and Tomakomai, areas of land have already been identified: the smooth passage of legislation could see the first casinos opening some time after 2022.The prospect of Japan enacting an “implementation bill” this year to establish the precise rules under which casinos can operate has already intensified promotional and lobbying activities among global operators.Descriptions of imagined resorts have been accompanied by eye-watering investment pledges. Lawrence Ho, the head of Melco Resorts & Entertainment, one of Macau’s biggest casino group, has said he would invest “whatever it takes” and offered to relocate his headquarters to Japan as part of a broader charm offensive to woo authorities.For Mr Abe, whose broader “Abenomics” economic revival programme has lost its former momentum, casinos represent a possible way to stimulate growth in regions suffering an exodus of people and wealth.Standing in the way of this, however, has been Komeito, whose recent efforts to apply the brakes to casino legislation have included arguing that a proposed ¥2,000 entrance fee was too low.One person close to Komeito politicians said: “This is a meeting that will have a lot of moving parts, and a number of issues like tax rates, entrance fees and the physical size of casino floors will be subject to horse-trading.“But probably the biggest haggle is going to be over the number of licences. The LDP is going to come in very aggressively with a proposal for either five or six licences. In the end, I think they will walk away very happy if that is bargained down to three.”
4;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2018-03-02T05:00:50Z;Macau bets on luring Chinese mass market punters;Shift from VIP gamblers is a political and financial necessity, say analysts;Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts are stalwarts of the US gambling industry but their profits — and their prospects— depend on tempting new Chinese punters like Li Yunlong into their glitzy, multibillion dollar Macau venues.The 28-year-old project manager, who works at a baby milk company in China’s northernmost Heilongjiang province, has travelled 3,000 kilometres south to try his luck in the only part of China where casinos are legal.“I want to experience gambling,” says the novice, who is planning to bet $100-$200 at the casino tables. “But I don’t know how to play any of the games.”A jump in mass-market visitors like Mr Li helped push gross gaming revenue to $6.3bn in the first two months of the year, up 20 per cent on the same period in 2017, according to official data released this week.Under pressure from the Chinese government to reduce their reliance on credit-fuelled high-rollers, Macau’s six casino operators — Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts, US rival MGM Resorts International and three local players — have invested more than $20bn over the past five years in sprawling new resorts designed to attract a wider range of customers from across the world’s most populous country.Their mission to lure more Chinese gamblers from beyond their traditional base in neighbouring Guangdong province will be supported by a raft of infrastructure developments this year. These include a vast bridge linking Macau to Hong Kong’s well-connected airport and an extension of China’s high-speed rail network to near the Macau border.Analysts say that the shift from VIP to mass-market gamblers is a political and financial necessity, after Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a nationwide crackdown on corruption and exuberance that prompted Macau’s gross gaming revenue to slide from a record high of $45bn in 2013 to $33bn last year.“Macau needs to work on reinventing itself as more mature markets like Las Vegas have done,” says James Murren, chief executive of MGM Resorts, which opened its new $3.4bn Macau casino last month. “The Chinese government has been crystal clear and for those who don’t listen it will be to their peril.”The fancy restaurants, theatrical shows and theme-park rides at these resorts are marketing tools for the casinos, which are not allowed to advertise in China, more than profit centres in themselves, say analysts.Non-gaming facilities in Macau produce just 12 per cent of total revenue, according to Morgan Stanley, compared with 65 per cent on the Las Vegas Strip, which hosts hit shows, top sporting events and major conferences.But it is Macau that generates the majority of profits for Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, which is going through a tricky transition period after founder and chief executive Steve Wynn resigned last month after sexual harassment allegations made against him.Last year, Macau accounted for 71 per cent of adjusted earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at Wynn Resorts and 53 per cent at Las Vegas Sands.The shift to mass-market customers should help boost Macau profits because casinos make bigger margins from them than the VIPs. Casinos typically give these high-rollers rebates on their gambling losses and share a chunk of profits with junkets, the middlemen who bring in the Chinese VIPs and extend them credit to get around China’s capital controls.Praveen Choudhary, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, says that mass-market profit margins are about 40 per cent compared with 10 per cent for the VIPs.The proportion of gaming revenue generated by mass-market gamblers has already risen from 27 per cent in 2011 to 43 per cent last year, according to analysis by debt rating agency Standard & Poor’s, partly as a result of a slump in VIP gambling after the corruption crackdown began.Clifford Kurz, an analyst at S&P, expects this shift to continue as Macau, a former Portuguese colony, continues to benefit from the growth of outbound travel in China.“In the long term, we expect the mass market to be a sustainable driver of gaming revenue growth,” he says.But Macau, which is less than one-tenth of the size of Las Vegas but has a similar population of 600,000 people, still struggles to convince tourists to stay long.Just under half of the 33m tourists who visited Macau last year were day-trippers and the average stay is just 1.2 nights, compared with four nights in Singapore, which has much more to offer beyond its two casino resorts.MGM Resorts’ chief Mr Murren says that while the pace of development in Macau has been “remarkable” — with gaming revenue five times higher than on the Las Vegas Strip — the city still has “a ways to go” if it is to become a broad-based tourism and hospitality destination.“I don’t know that Macau will have the same mix as Vegas any time soon but it can certainly be far greater than the overall mix of revenue that it has today,” he says.Additional reporting by Nicolle Liu
5;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2018-01-29T18:18:15Z;Avon shares jump as activists renew call for shake-up;Activist investors want further change at the struggling US cosmetics group;Avon Products shares advanced on Monday after a group of activist funds urged the cosmetics group to put itself up for sale following its “deteriorating” performance and lambasted the board for the “tremendous destruction of shareholder value”.Shares in the cosmetics company rose 3 per cent to $2.49 after Barington Capital, Shah Capital and NuOrion Partners, which together own 3.5 per cent of Avon stock, asked the company to hire financial advisers to explore selling all or part of the group.“We are extremely disappointed by the company’s deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under your stewardship,” the activists wrote in a letter to Avon’s board. “We are dismayed by the failure of the board of directors of Avon to act quickly and decisively on the recommendations our group members have made to improve the long-term performance of the company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer — a step that has been overdue for years.”The consortium has been invested in Avon for several years. The company last year reached a deal with the activists to allow them to approve an independent director to the board, preventing a proxy fight. A spokesperson for Avon said the management team is “committed to delivering value for all shareholders, and will continue to take actions to improve performance”.The rise in Avon shares came on a weaker day for Wall Street, as the sell-off in US Treasuries continued with the yield on the US 10-year breaching 2.7 per cent for the first time since 2014. By lunchtime in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent to 2,858.98, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 26,505.08. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 7,475.08.Meanwhile, shares in Wynn Resorts fell for a second day, after allegations reported on Friday that chief executive Steve Wynn had sexually harassed women over decades. The casino operator said it was investigating claims that Mr Wynn engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment towards staff. Mr Wynn said the idea that “I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous”.Shares in Wynn, which posted upbeat results last week thanks to strong revenue at its operations in Macau, fell 7.6 per cent to $166.60. Meanwhile, shares in rival Las Vegas Sands were up more than 4 per cent to $78.57.UBS analysts downgraded Wynn to “neutral” from “buy” on Monday, but raised the price target on the stock, noting that the allegations against Mr Wynn “and subsequent investigations will probably cap near-term upside in the stock, in our view, so the stock’s outperformance combined with increased uncertainty in the outlook has prompted our downgrade”.
6;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2018-01-24T21:59:20Z;Las Vegas Sands reports ‘robust’ Macau recovery as results top estimates;;Las Vegas Sands on Wednesday reported a “robust recovery” in Macau, the former Portuguese colony and the world’s largest gambling hub, as it posted fourth-quarter results exceeded estimates.Billionaire Sheldon Adelson’s casino operator said its profit jumped to $1.2bn or $1.53 a share in the three months ended in December, compared with a profit of $509m or 64 cents a share in the year-ago period. The profits reflected a benefit of $526m from the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Adjusting for the one-time tax boost, the company reported earnings of 88 cents a share, handily topping estimates of 77 cents, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.The jump in profits came as new revenue rose nearly 12 per cent from a year ago to $3.44bn, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for $3.3bn. That was boosted by a more than 13 per cent increase in Macau operations to $2.1bn.“The Macau market continued its robust recovery during the quarter, with growth in the important Mass gaming market accelerating in the fourth quarter of 2017,” said Mr Adelson.Las Vegas Sands’ upbeat results follow similarly positive figures from Wynn Resorts. Casino operators are expected to fare well as conditions improve in Macau.Macau, the only Chinese territory where casino gambling is legal, endured a more than two-year slump in gaming revenues that began in mid-2014 amid China’s anti-graft campaign, as well as some weakness in the Chinese economy. However, the market began to recover last year, and some analysts have taken a bullish view, with those at Morgan Stanley arguing that Macau “is in the early stages of a multiyear growth path”.Shares in Las Vegas Sands, which are up more than 11 per cent year-to-date, climbed 1 per cent in extended trade.
7;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Halliburton shares in demand after upbeat outlook;US oilfield services company is one of many enjoying the rise in commodity prices;Oilfield services group Halliburton was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 after reporting upbeat quarterly results and becoming the latest oil company to report a brightening outlook following the rise in commodity prices over the past six months.Halliburton shares climbed nearly 4 per cent to $54.98 after the company reported earnings per share, excluding one-off items, of 53 cents for the fourth quarter, up from just 4 cents in the year-ago quarter. They also topped the average of analysts’ forecast, which was 46 cents.The company was boosted in particular by a surge in revenues in North America, its largest market. They were up 89 per cent at $3.4bn, while total group revenues worldwide were up 48 per cent at $5.94bn, ahead of expectations.Like several other companies in oil and other industries, however, Halliburton was hit by a non-cash charge from writing down the value of its tax losses following the steep cut in US corporate tax rates passed at the end of last year. The company took an $882m charge for that writedown, while warning that it was still working through its analysis of how the upheaval in the tax system would affect earnings, and “this provisional amount is subject to change”.It also took a $385m charge for writedowns in the value of its business in crisis-hit Venezuela. Including those charges, Halliburton reported a loss per share of 92 cents.Jeff Miller, chief executive, said 2017 had been “a dynamic year for the oil and gas sector that marked another step on the road to recovery for our industry”, and described Halliburton as “well positioned to take advantage of opportunities presented by a growing North America market and improving international outlook”.He said he was “optimistic about what I see in 2018”, with oil and gas prices supporting increasing activity in North America, and encouraging increases in tender activity and “positive discussions” with international customers. His comments follow similarly upbeat statements from competitor Schlumberger last Friday.The advance in Halliburton shares came alongside a broader rise on Wall Street where investors appeared largely unfazed by the US government shutdown. By midday, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 2,820.23, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 26,103.42, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent to 7,381.59.Meanwhile, Wynn Resorts was the second-biggest gainer on the S&P 500, with shares rising nearly 5 per cent to $188.28 after it posted upbeat fourth-quarter results.Profits jumped to $491.6m, or $4.77 a share, in the three months ended in December, from $113.8m, or $1.12 a share. That reflected a net tax benefit of $339.9m after the company revalued its US deferred tax assets and liabilities. Adjusting for one-off items, the company reported earnings of $1.40 a share, eclipsing analysts’ forecasts by 3 cents.Net revenues climbed 29 per cent from a year ago to $1.69bn, ahead of expectations, as casino revenues in Macau rose 25.3 per cent from a year ago.Wynn’s results also helped lift rival casino operators, with shares in Las Vegas Sands up more than 2 per cent to $76.23, MGM Resorts shares climbing 1 per cent to $36.75 and US depositary receipts in Melco Resorts increasing 1 per cent to $29.51.
8;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2017-10-26T03:02:39Z;Las Vegas Sands to give Macau resort a London theme under $1.1bn investment;;London may have fallen out of favour after Brexit, but Las Vegas Sands is such a fan of the place it’s going to renovate one of its casino resorts in Macau to incorporate the city’s landmarks under a $1.1bn investment into its operations in the Chinese territory.The company said it will invest the sum in new capital projects in Macau with the bulk of the investment on rebranding the Sands Cotai Central into The Londoner Macao.“The Londoner Macao will feature dynamic new attractions and features from London including some of London’s most recognisable landmarks, an expanded and reimagined retail mall and 350 luxurious new suites,” the company said as it announced earnings for the three months ending September 30.The company said the market in Macau “continues to recover” as mass and VIP gaming volumes outpaced overall growth in the market in the gambling hub. Hotel occupancy and retail mall revenues were also higher during the period.Net profit for Sands China rose 24.4 per cent year on year to $403m in the three months to September 30 and revenue climbed 12.2 per cent to $1.93bn.Macau is the world’s largest gambling centre and the only location on Chinese soil where casino gambling is legal, but revenues declined sharply from 2014 when it was hit by an anti-corruption crackdown in mainland China. Gaming revenues now appear to have turned the corner and have posted 14 consecutive months of growth.Sands China shares were down 0.7 per cent against a 0.2 per cent fall for the benchmark Hang Seng index.

10;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2017-10-02T13:06:22Z;"US stock futures edge higher; casino, gun stocks move after Las Vegas shooting";;US stock futures edged higher on Monday, the first trading day of the fourth quarter, as investors digest news of the latest mass shooting in Las Vegas and eye another data-heavy week, including Friday’s all important jobs report.With less than an hour to go before the markets open, futures for the the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq-100 are all up 0.2 per cent.Both the S&P and the Nasdaq, which set new closing and intraday highs on Friday, could set fresh records on Monday when trading begins.Among individual stocks, both casino and gunmaker stocks are on the move after a gunman opened fire on a crowd at a country music festival in Las Vegas on Sunday evening, killing at least 50 and injuring more than 400.Shares in MGM Resorts International, whose Mandalay Bay property in Vegas was stormed by police in the wake of the attack, fell 4.5 per cent in pre-market trading.Concerns over how the attack – the deadliest mass shooting in US history – will affect the tourism trade to Las Vegas also weighed on rival casino and resort operators. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts were both down 1 per cent.Gun stocks received a lift however on expectations that any efforts to revive talks on gun control will trigger a buying frenzy.Shares in Sturm Ruger are up 2.6 per cent, while American Outdoor Brands, once known as Smith & Wesson, rose 3 per cent.On the data front, the ISM manufacturing data will be out later this morning at 10am. Ahead of that release, yield on the 10-year is largely unchanged at 2.3265 per cent. The dollar is building on last week’s gain, with the DXY index up 0.4 per cent.
11;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2017-05-21T21:11:58Z;Macau casinos cash in again as China’s luxury sector rebounds;Despite recovery, gambling executives are wary of further crackdown from Beijing;Casino executives in Macau are confident that the slowdown of recent years is behind them amid a broad recovery in luxury goods demand in China.The only part of China where casinos are legal, Macau was hit hard by President Xi Jinping’s corruption crackdown and austerity drive, which scared away many of the high-rollers who had helped revenues surge in previous years.Macau is the world’s largest gambling centre but revenues have declined sharply since 2014 — when China’s corruption crackdown first began to hit the enclave. The six casino operators in Macau have seen their combined market capitalisation fall 46 per cent since early 2014, wiping out $97.7bn of shareholder value.Gross gaming revenue — a key industry measure — started to grow again on an annualised basis in August after more than two years, amid reduced fears about the anti-graft campaign and the opening of a number of multibillion-dollar casino resorts.“The numbers are up, the scaffolding is down, the energy is up and we’re on the road to good times,” says Geoff Freeman, chief executive of the American Gaming Association, the lobby group for US casino groups including Macau operators Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts.Fitch, the credit rating agency, expects gross gaming revenue to grow by 12 per cent this year to $31bn, after peaking at $45bn in 2013 and falling to $28bn last year.Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Bernstein, the equity research house, says that Macau’s performance has tracked the wider luxury sector in China, which is recovering amid a perception that the toughest days of Mr Xi’s anti-graft campaign are in the past.“The anti-corruption campaign has seen a moderation in the last few months and there’s also an element of fatigue,” he says. “High net-worth individuals are sitting back and thinking that ‘If I haven’t been affected by now, then I’m probably OK’.”A surge in real estate prices and an increase in the money supply in China have also left wealthy individuals and the middlemen who provide them with credit in Macau — known as junkets — with more access to the funds they need for gambling.But executives are concerned that if the VIP sector rebounds too strongly, the Chinese government will put pressure on the Macau authorities to tighten regulation further.“The central government has made it clear to us that they don’t want to see gaming revenue shooting up,” says Francis Lui, deputy chairman of Galaxy Entertainment, another of the six casino operators in Macau. “They want diversification.”Over the last couple of years, the government of Macau, which is a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, has clamped down on the junkets and instituted a number of measures designed to discourage people using the city as a conduit to get their money out of China.Earlier this month, the Macau government proposed further restricting the use of ATM cards by Chinese consumers, in order to curb capital outflows from the mainland and reduce the risks of money laundering.Macau — and the casino operators — have been under pressure from Beijing to show that they are transforming the city into a broader-based tourist destination such as Las Vegas, rather than just a den for high stakes gamblers.This plan has been helped by the opening of a slew of large resorts over the last couple of years, including the Wynn Palace, Galaxy’s Phase Two and Melco International’s Studio City.Improvements to Macau’s poor infrastructure, such as a new ferry terminal and light rail system, will also help attract more mass market gamblers and their families when they are completed over the next year, analysts say.Macau attracted more than 30m tourists last year, most of them from mainland China and Hong Kong. The number of visitors increased by a little more than 5 per cent year on year in the first quarter this year.Paulo Martins Chan, director of the Gaming Inspection and Co-Ordination Bureau, Macau’s gambling regulator, says that the industry is “in a good balance today,” with nearly half of the casino revenues coming from mass market players rather than VIPs backed by the junkets.He says that his agency was continuing an audit of all the junket operators designed to weed out those with questionable records, leaving those that are “financially healthy and capable”.Charlie Choi, chairman of the Macau Gaming Information Association, a lobby group for junkets, says that the industry had “learnt lessons over the past two years” when several junket groups collapsed amid the slowdown because of unsustainable bad debts.“The survivors have improved their credit management and are being much more careful,” he says.
12;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2017-04-04T20:02:56Z;Casino bosses will bet big to open Japan’s gaming industry;Leading global operators to vie with local operators when Japan’s casino law changes;Camped out on Japan’s doorstep is a formidable phalanx of glitz and greed. Las Vegas Sands, MGM, Melco Crown are among the world’s biggest casino operators peering at the promised land inside — some of them openly vowing to do “whatever it takes” to unlock the door.It is a pledge that other international groups — including banks, retailers and carmakers — have made over the years, and one that Japan has a mischievous tradition of testing to the limit.Many of the casino high-rollers have been waiting, on and off, for years — fighting frustration as they suffer the tortoise-paced politics required to open the world’s third-biggest economy to casino gambling and create a market that some analysts predict could be worth $25bn a year.Divert just a quarter of the $200bn that Japanese annually funnel into pachinko machines to slots, baccarat and blackjack, runs the most bullish vision, and you have a Japanese gaming market bigger than Macau’s. And since last December, when the government of Shinzo Abe dashed a law through parliament that makes it all legally possible, the operators’ ambitions have been free to soar.Behind the scenes, say those involved, an international spread of casino operators, construction companies, architects, hotel groups and property developers are cautiously forming proto-consortia. The bolder ones already arrive at meetings clutching artists’ impressions of skyline-dominating casino resorts looming over various Japanese cities.A crucial second law, laying out the precise terms under which casinos will be regulated, is expected to come this year, paving the way for bidding to begin two years later. The prime minister himself sits on a newly-appointed secretariat drawing up the legislation. Osaka — the city most likely to issue the first integrated resort license — this week established a working group of officials to ready itself to receive and judge the bids.But there are still pitfalls ahead — many of them already visible to the casino operators (which claim to have learnt from the collective failures of other industries to crack Japan). The two most obvious challenges would be regulation that limited the ability of Japanese to freely gamble in their own casinos and a level of gaming tax higher than the 17 per cent blended rate in Singapore.“We know what we want, and the Japanese know what we want,” explains one casino executive during a visit to Tokyo. “But logic doesn’t always apply.”A third risk, say lawyers, will emerge when, or if, Japan sets a minimum level of Japanese ownership in each integrated resort — a constraint that could produce what one casino industry analyst described as “potentially dysfunctional” alliances. Konami, the Japanese slot machine maker with a customer base in Las Vegas, also last week provided another warning of unseen dangers after a senior executive warned of the “grey” industries that could easily take root around casinos if laws were not watertight.But the excitement around the prospect of casinos in Japan remains and is all the more striking for being mostly generated by non-Japanese. At an investment forum in Tokyo earlier this year, Las Vegas Sands floated a figure of $10bn for the scale of investment it would consider. Potential rivals, including Macau’s Galaxy Entertainment and the Société des Bains de Mer which runs the casino in Monte Carlo, will need to plug similar numbers into their investment calculations. Everyone, it seems, is prepared to pay spectacularly to be in Japan. Set against this is the behaviour of corporate Japan, whose record-breaking run of outbound dealmaking has been driven by the narrative that the domestic market is shrinking and that sustainable growth prospects must be secured abroad.“When the IR [integrated resort] consortiums start forming properly and the investment plans start taking shape, a lot of different industries in Japan are going to realise the scale of the opportunity unfolding on their own shores,” says one US-based casino industry executive. “Then it becomes a question both of Japan’s keenness to put its companies at the centre and its willingness to embrace what is basically going to be a big exercise in globalisation at home.”Everyone involved in the process know that the house always wins: the question that will play out between now and the end of the year is who, out of Japan and the overseas casino operators, actually gets to be the house.leo.lewis@ft.com
13;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2017-02-21T09:31:32Z;Tokyo casino the ‘holy grail’ for Sheldon Adelson;Magnate vows to invest up to $10bn if he wins race to build resort in Japanese capital;Tokyo is the “holy grail” said casino magnate Sheldon Adelson as he vowed to invest up to $10bn if he wins the race to build a resort in Japan’s capital.The remarks by Mr Adelson, chairman of Las Vegas Sands and one of the world’s richest men, highlight the opportunity in Japan after prime minister Shinzo Abe’s legalisation of casino gambling.The titans of global gaming have descended on Tokyo, with the chiefs of Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts and Melco Crown all in the city, as they jockey for position and form consortiums to pitch “integrated resorts”.“It’s the ultimate of business opportunities. Singapore was a warm-up to this,” declared Mr Adelson at the CLSA Japan Forum in Tokyo. Las Vegas Sands has expanded from its home city to Macau and Singapore.He said that Japan was a “country of chance taking” with one ‘pachinko’ gambling machine for every 25 people in the country. A resort in Tokyo would cost at least as much as the $6bn he spent in Singapore and “could be as much as $10bn”, he said.The rush to Japan comes after Mr Abe rammed through a bill legalising casinos last December in the teeth of strong public opposition. Despite fears about gambling addiction and crime, the government sees casinos as a way to generate new activity and tourism in a stagnant economy.For gaming companies, it opens up one of the world’s largest untapped markets, and the race is on to secure the best sites ahead of further legislation specifying the licensing rules, the tax system and thus who can operate what and where.Integrated resorts are intended to combine casinos with hotels, conference and entertainment facilities. Mr Adelson pitched his expertise in “MICE” — which stands for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions. He said it was a “breeding ground for general tourism” because business visitors return as tourists.Japan’s government has sold casinos as a way to revitalise struggling regional economies, but Mr Adelson signalled that he was mainly interested in Tokyo, citing the need for “tourism infrastructure” such as hotels, restaurants, entertainment and nightclubs.“There are some countries that think if you put an integrated resort somewhere in the boonies, you will attract a lot of other businesses. That’s a mistake,” he said. Other cities such as Yokohama, Osaka, Fukuoka and the island of Okinawa are all interested in hosting resorts.Mr Adelson was one of the biggest funders of Donald Trump’s campaign for the US presidency. He said his former rival in the casino business was “putting a lot of political correctness aside”.“I think in many ways he’s very good for our country,” Mr Adelson said.

Net income ticked higher to $607m in the fourth quarter 2016, from $575m in the same period in 2015.Adjusted profits, excluding certain items, were 62 cents a share, also shy of the expected 66 cents.Las Vegas Sands shares dropped by 4.3 per cent in extended trading in New York. They were up by 6.1 per cent for 2017 as of Wednesday’s close.Sheldon Adelson, chief executive, struck an upbeat note on Macau, the Chinese region that accounts for more than half of the company’s overall revenues.“The Macao market overall continued its recovery in the fourth quarter, while our Macao portfolio generated visitation growth of 23% and higher hotel occupancy rates. We are confident that the benefits of the increased scale we have achieved in our market-leading hotel, retail and entertainment offerings will enable us to deliver growth in Macao and strong financial performance.”Macau revenues rose by 11.6 per cent in the fourth quarter on a year-on-year basis to $1.87bn. Meanwhile, sales from its Las Vegas operations climbed to $412m from $400m over the same time-frame.
16;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2016-12-09T09:26:28Z;Macau denies report of lower limit on ATM withdrawals;Casino shares jolted by fears of new front in China’s battle to stem capital flight;Macau denied a report that daily money withdrawal limits from ATMs in the gambling haven would be halved, after a sell-off in casino stocks that highlighted investor jitters over China’s efforts to staunch capital flight.The Macau monetary authority said in a statement on Friday that it had halved the amount that could be withdrawn from an ATM per transaction to 5,000 patacas ($626), but that the daily withdrawal limit of Rmb10,000 ($1,449) remained unchanged.Macau-exposed gaming stocks listed in the US, Hong Kong and Australia fell heavily after Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported that the daily limit for ATM withdrawals by mainland bank card customers of China UnionPay in the former Portuguese colony — the only place in China where casinos are legal — would be lowered to 5,000 patacas from 10,000 patacas as of Saturday.China has moved in recent weeks to staunch capital gushing from the mainland, including tightening scrutiny of cross-border investment by Chinese companies and banning the purchase of certain insurance products. In some cases, repatriation of profits by foreign companies has been affected.The moves have shaken foreign investors and international markets. China’s foreign exchange regulator waded in on Friday to try and calm the waters: “At the moment, we haven’t seen any increase in corporate and individual purchases. Cross-border capital flows are generally relatively stable, and have maintained the basis for stable operation,” it said in a statement to China’s official Xinhua news agency.China UnionPay said in a separate statement on Friday that its policies on overseas cash withdrawal by cards issued from mainland China “remain the same” and that the daily maximum was still “capped at 10,000 renminbi equivalent per card per day”. It added that it “will continue to provide safe cross-border payment services while complying with the regulations and laws issued by relevant authorities”.Following the statements from UnionPay and the Macau authorities, casino shares in Hong Kong closed down between 4 and 8 per cent while Australia’s Crown finished down 5.3 per cent.US-listed casino stocks including Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and Melco Crown Entertainment fell by more than 10 per cent after the report first emerged — losses initially matched in Asia by Hong Kong-listed Galaxy Entertainment, Sands China and MGM China. Crown Resorts lost as much as 8 per cent in Sydney.In Macau on Friday there were no signs of disruption at any ATM machines, and mainland Chinese still thronged the casinos. In a sign of their importance, Lawrence Ho, son of gambling magnate Stanley Ho, told reporters that “if the news were true, it would be a blow to the industry in Macau.”Restrictions on the amount of money that can be moved through Macau began with an anti-corruption campaign launched by Chinese president Xi Jinping, as the city was a popular means of laundering ill-gotten money.This week, data showed China’s foreign exchange reserves fell nearly $70bn in November as the country’s central bank defended the renminbi from steeper depreciation on the back of accelerating capital outflows.Additional reporting by Gabriel Wildau in Shanghai and Gloria Cheung in MacauTwitter: @HornbyLucy
17;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Casino operators take a hit on report of Macau ATM limit;;Once again investors are betting against the house on news out of Macau.Shares in casino operators took a hit on Thursday after South China Morning Post reported that the former Portuguese colony is limiting the amount of money that people can withdraw from China UnionPay, China’s sole clearing house for bank card transactions, to 5,000 patacas — half the previous limit. The move comes amid claims that some UnionPay transactions have allowed for illicit ways of moving cash out of China.Macau, which is the only part of China where gambling is legal, has just surfaced from a 2-year long downturn and the report once again spooked investors.Indeed, a crackdown on corruption in China and slower growth saw gross gaming revenues in Macau decline from June 2014 through July this year. Gaming revenues were up a strong 14.4 per cent to 18.8bn patacas (about $2.4bn) in November.Here are some of the casino operators that took the biggest hit on Thursday:
18;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2016-11-21T18:18:04Z;Investors bet on Macau casino operators after CS upgrade;;Investors are betting on a Macau VIP comeback.Casino operators with large Macau presence saw their shares rallied on Monday after Credit Suisse issued an upgrade on a handful of companies, citing healthier junket trends and the opening of new VIP rooms as a fresh sign of recovery.Shares in Wynn Resorts climbed six per cent to $97.97 after the Swiss bank raised its rating on its Macau unit, Wynn Macau, to “neutral” from “underperform”.Meanwhile, shares in Las Vegas Sands rose 6.2 per cent to $98.05 and shares in MGM Resorts gained 2.4 per cent to $29.12 as their subsidiaries Sands China and MGM China were upgraded to “outperform from “neutral”. Melco Crown Entertainment shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $19.40, on a ratings boost as well.Analysts at Credit Suisse said consolidation among so-called junket operators is nearly done. Junket operators are middlemen who have fuelled growth in Macau’s gambling market by bringing wealthy Chinese to the region and providing them with credit lines needed to sidestep currency controls in the mainland.“As the volume is now concentrated among the top junkets, which have a much stronger balance sheet (to grow business), better internal control system (to comply with the new junket regulation) and agents network (to source players and managing fund flow), we believe this provides a solid foundation for healthy growth in 2017,” Kenneth Fong, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said.He added that some new junket operators are also opening new VIP rooms, which is another sign of recovery.Indeed, gaming revenues have increased for the past three months, after a crackdown on corruption in China and a drop in prices of natural resources weighed on the VIP segment and kicked off a downturn in mid-2014.“As the anti-corruption campaign normalises, we believe VIP revenue will gradually reflect the true underlying demand,” Mr Fong said. He thinks Macau is at the start of a recovery cycle that could last as long as two years.Unlike the US, Macau’s gambling market tends to be dominated by high-rollers dubbed the VIP market. These so-called “casino whales” spend significantly more than the mass market – which tends to be less profitable because these people spend less per person and largely tend to visit around the holidays.
19;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2016-09-01T21:32:38Z;US casino shares rally on Macau lift;An improvement in gaming revenues send shares of Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands higher;Shares of US casino companies with operations in Macau rallied on Thursday as gaming revenues in China’s gambling peninsula rose for the first time in 27 months.Gross gaming revenue in Macau climbed 1.1 per cent in August from a year ago to 18.8bn patacas (about $2.36bn), according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau. That was the first rise in revenues since May 2014 and followed a 4.5 per cent decline the previous month.The protracted slump in Macau’s gaming revenues was driven by a Chinese crackdown on corruption and weakness in the wider economy.Shares in Wynn Resorts jumped 4.3 per cent to $93.17. Shares in Las Vegas Sands climbed 7.2 per cent to $53.81, while shares in MGM Resorts International rose 3.2 per cent to $24.65. Melco Crown Entertainment shares increased 7.4 per cent to $13.94 and the Russell 3000 casinos and gambling index rose 4.5 per cent.Not everyone thought the bounce was justified.“We remain on the sidelines of the Macau gaming names [Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and Melco Crown] as estimates and valuations adjust to a ‘new normal’ of a weak Chinese economy and a recovery that is likely to be flatter than prior rebounds, contributing to more muted revenue growth in Macau,” said Cameron McKnight, an analyst at Wells Fargo.The rally in casino shares came alongside softness in the wider market. Downbeat economic data showing that the US factory sector contracted for the first time in six months, along with productivity that was worse than initially estimated, dragged stocks lower in earlier trade.At the close, the S&P 500 was unchanged at 2,170.9 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up 0.1 per cent to 18,419.3. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 5,227.2.Thursday also marked the arrival of an 11th sector, as real estate became a distinct sector in the Global Industry Classification Standard. Financials, the sector from which real estate has been removed, declined 0.5 per cent, while the newly launched real estate sector, slipped 0.1 per cent.Elsewhere, shares in Salesforce fell 4.4 per cent to $75.91, after the cloud services company issued a sales outlook for the current quarter that was shy of analysts’ estimates.The California-based company forecast sales in the range of $2.11bn-$2.12bn, just shy of the $2.13bn that analysts were looking for. The news accompanied better than expected second-quarter earnings and sales.Analysts also pointed to disappointing billings in the second quarter, noting that implied billings growth of 12 per cent in the third quarter would be “the slowest growth since the recession”,according to Brian Schwartz, analyst at Oppenheimer. However, he noted that the soft results were transitory and that the company was headed towards a stronger position.Meanwhile, shares in Campbell Soup fell 6.3 per cent to $56.91 after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and a full-year earnings outlook that missed analysts’ estimates.
20;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2016-07-29T08:46:23Z;Wynn Macau dealt setback with licences;Casino operator allocated fewer new tables than sought in under-pressure industry;Macau casino operators remain under pressure from a drop-off in high rollers even as they bet that new multibillion-dollar resorts will boost their appeal to a broader range of Chinese gamblers.The Macau casino companies controlled by US gambling tycoons Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn this week reported an annualised fall in VIP betting during the second quarter of 2016, as the corruption crackdown and financial problems in China continued to deter the wealthiest gamblers.In the latest setback, shares in Wynn Macau fell more than 6 per cent on Friday after the Hong Kong-listed company revealed it had secured fewer table licences than expected for its $4.2bn resort, which opens next month in the only part of China where casinos are legal.Macau regulators have allowed the company only 100 tables at the Wynn Palace casino, far short of the 200-250 analysts were hoping for.The company said it would move 250 of its table games from its existing casino to the new resort, a shift that analysts warned could lead to “cannibalisation”.But Mr Wynn, chief executive and chairman of parent company Wynn Resorts, said many of the tables at the existing Wynn Macau casino had been in effect surplus to requirements, with just 60 of the 180 VIP tables there generating almost all of the earnings.“We had an enormous amount of tables that were idle, with payroll, in anticipation of the shift to the other place,” he said on a call with analysts.Mr Wynn was “positive” the new property would bring in more “premium mass” gamblers from China, a category he defined as those spending $2,000-$3,000 per bet.He said the Wynn Palace, which will comprise luxury rooms and restaurants featuring decor including 25-foot Fabergé eggs, would be “the most elegant, the most completely diversified attraction in the hospitality industry that exists anywhere in the world”.Analysts said they were hopeful the opening of the Wynn Palace and Mr Adelson’s Parisian casino resort in September would help attract more mass-market gamblers, who bet with cash rather than borrowing from shadowy middlemen known as junkets, as do many VIPs.“Over the longer term, we believe Wynn Palace may . . . enable the company to gain share in the highly profitable premium mass business and maintain a competitive edge in VIP,” said Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong.Operating profit at Wynn Macau fell 8.7 per cent to $86m in the second quarter, compared to the same period in 2015. The amount of money bet by VIPs fell 23.8 per cent to $11.8bn but casino revenue — which accounts for 95 per cent of overall revenue — increased 5 per cent to $608m as Wynn enjoyed its luckiest quarter in Macau.Overall, gross gaming revenue at Macau’s casinos, including those operated by Wynn Macau and Sands China — the Hong Kong-listed unit of Mr Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands — fell 11 per cent to $13bn in the first half of the year, from the same period in 2015.At Sands China, gross gaming revenue fell an annualised 20 per cent in the second quarter to $1.4bn, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation slipped 2 per cent to $488m.“The operating environment in Macau remained challenging during the quarter, but we do see signs of stabilisation, particularly in the mass market,” said Mr Adelson.
21;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Singapore’s casinos shift bets to mass-market gamblers;Asia’s second-biggest gaming hub grappling with China’s anti-graft drive and economic slowdown ;The newly opened restaurant at Singapore’s Resorts World, the complex best known for its 15,000 sq m casino, is billed as Asia’s first Michelin chef showcase. Every few weeks a new Michelin-starred chef takes charge of the kitchen at Curate, serving up a limited-edition tasting menu in a haute cuisine twist on pop-up dining.The move is part of efforts to attract new customers and shore up sagging profits as Asia’s second-biggest gambling hub feels the pain of China’s anti-corruption drive and economic slowdown.That slump was underlined this month when Resorts World announced it was cutting staff in its gaming business — a move necessary to “stay relevant in this challenging market”, it said in a statement. Big-betting Chinese gamblers drive earnings at casinos across the region but they have scaled back their activity over the past two years in light of President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on graft and extravagance, as well as the impact of slowing mainland economic growth.Gross gaming revenue in Macau, the Chinese territory that is the world’s biggest casino centre by revenue, dropped 10 per cent in May to $2.3bn from the same period a year earlier, dwindling for a 25th straight month. Crown Resorts, the Australian gambling group controlled by billionaire James Packer, is spinning off its international investments into a separate company, partly to insulate its domestic business from the Macau slowdown.Industry analysts have been debating whether the China clampdown will drive business to casinos elsewhere in Asia or simply shrink the size of the Chinese VIP betting market across the region. The pressures on Singapore’s casino add to suggestions that, for now, other markets are suffering the fallout from the China slowdown. Net profit at Resorts World’s owner Genting Singapore, which is controlled by Malaysia’s Lim family, fell 70 per cent last year to S$193m, the smallest profit since the casino opened in 2010. The business, like rival Marina Bay Sands, has been squeezed by the anti-corruption crackdown and a surge in bad debt as unlucky gamblers leave without paying up. Casino revenue at Marina Bay Sands, owned by Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, dropped 10 per cent year on year in 2015. The debt burden on Singapore casinos — Genting Singapore took a S$270m loss on trade receivables last year, up from S$262m the year before — contrasts with Macau, where casinos are more insulated from their gamblers’ misfortunes by using middlemen known as junket operators who provide credit to customers and collect debt.Tushar Mohata, analyst at Nomura, predicts the Singapore casino slump is bottoming out, citing data showing the volume of VIP play at Genting stabilising at S$8.5bn per quarter following a sharp drop immediately after the launch of China’s anti-corruption crackdown in 2014.Non-gaming revenues at Genting’s Resorts World remain healthy, down only marginally from S$653m in 2014 to S$650m in 2015. Resorts World, based on the island of Sentosa off Singapore, also operates the Universal Studios theme park, an aquarium, hotels and restaurants.Mr Mohata says: “Genting is doing quite well in non-gaming revenue. Marina Bay Sands hasn’t added any capacity since its hotel opened, but last year Genting opened a new hotel in Jurong — it’s a little further away from Sentosa, but the average room rate is lower and it appeals to the budget-conscious traveller.” Jessalynn Chen, analyst at CIMB, says Resorts World is attempting to shift away from the VIP business to focus more on mass-market gamblers. That mirrors moves in Macau, where the casino operators have also closed VIP rooms and opened new hotels and tourist attractions in an attempt to attract a wider customer base.“They have been redeploying [staff] who used to work in the VIP business, to the mass-market segment,” Ms Chen says. “They’re also trying to bring in new customers with promotions such as bringing in Michelin-starred chefs.” Compared with the VIP sector, the mass market has not been as squeezed by the anti-graft drive as these travellers tend to be from other Southeast Asian countries, analysts say — though the weakening of regional currencies including the Malaysian ringgit will make it more expensive for tourists from neighbouring countries to visit Singapore. Still, Singapore’s casinos are likely to continue to face pressure from intensifying international competition for high-spending Chinese tourists. Hong-Kong-listed Imperial Pacific has opened a casino in Saipan, a US-administered Pacific island, while casino businesses are expanding in South Korea and Vietnam. Grant Govertsen, head of Asia equity research at Union Gaming, says: “There’s plenty of supply coming on. The pie is not going to get much bigger and it’s going to be cut into more slices.”

Wynn Resorts was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500, climbing more than 6 per cent to $93.85.Wynn resorts and other casino operators rallied as the decline in gaming revenues in Macau slowed in April. Gross gaming revenue in China’s gambling peninsula slid just 9.5 per cent year-on-year to 17.3bn patacas (about $2.2bn) in April, slower than the 16.5 per cent drop recorded in March, according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau.Shares in MGM Resorts rose 2 per cent to $21.75, shares in Las Vegas Sands rose 4.4 per cent to $47.13, while Melco Crown Entertainment shares gained 3.8 per cent to $15.35.The advance came even as manufacturing expanded at a slower-than-expected pace in April. A gauge of manufacturing slipped to 50.8 in April, from 51.8 the previous month, according to the latest figures from the Institute of Supply Management. That missed economists’ estimates for a reading of 51.4.Elsewhere, the dollar inched up 0.1 against the yen, to ¥106.55 yen. The greenback had declined to its lowest level against the Japanese currency since October 2014 on Friday, after the Bank of Japan held steady on monetary policy. Last week, the US Treasury placed Japan, China and Germany on a new currency watchlist.Wall Street’s gains followed a quiet session in Asia Europe, where markets in Shanghai, Hong Kong and the UK remained closed.

This was short of Wall Street estimates for earnings of 50 cents a share, on sales of $1.1bn.KB Home delivered 2,580 homes last quarter, up 16 per cent from a year ago, but chief executive Jeff Mezger said inclement weather and labour shortages in some markets had “tempered” deliveries and “ultimately impacted our profitability for the quarter”.Homebuilders came under pressure after the disappointing results and amid a broader market sell-off. DR Horton fell 4 per cent to $28.53, Lennar slid 4 per cent to $43.43, and PulteGroup dropped 4 per cent to $16.22.Meanwhile Walgreens Boots Alliance said its net earnings in the quarter to November 30 had been 30.5 per cent higher than in the same period in 2014. Adjusted earnings per share clocked in at $1.03, handily topping Wall Street estimates of 96 cents.Shares of the pharmacy chain rallied 2 per cent to $81.17, adding to a 12-month rise of 7 per cent.Investors bid up shares of JC Penney. The department store chain said same-store sales had risen 3.9 per cent during the holiday shopping period as unseasonably warm weather weighed on other retailers, such as competitor Macy’s.JC Penney’s shares advanced 3.6 per cent to $7.26.On Thursday the S&P 500 fell 2.4 per cent to 1,943.09, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.3 per cent to 16,514.10, and the Nasdaq Composite lost own 3 per cent to 4,689.43.

They closed down 3.86 per cent at $109.96.The analysts said their quarterly US subscriber survey suggested “potentially weaker US subscriber results for the second consecutive quarter” compared with a normal quarterly increase into the holiday period.The survey showed 46 per cent of its 3,000 US respondents were Netflix streaming subscribers compared with 47 per cent the previous quarter.“This appears to point to more flattish Q4’15 US subscriber progress and, if accurate, potentially raises some questions around the US subscriber growth trajectory,” said William Power, an analyst with the firm.A $1 price increase, which took effect in October, could have had a greater impact on subscription growth than previously thought, he said.Moreover, Mr Power noted that Netflix’s international subscriber growth could beat forecasts but that the expectation was largely priced in. Netflix shares advanced more than 130 per cent last year.Shares in Tesla were also on the back foot after the electric carmaker reported fourth-quarter total vehicle deliveries at the low end of its guidance range.Its shares fell 6.92 per cent to $223.41 after the Palo Alto-based company said it delivered 17,400 cars in the last quarter, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Sunday. This compared with its previous outlook for 17,000 to 19,000 deliveries.The company also said it delivered just 208 of its Model X sport utility vehicle, which launched with a two-year delay in September. Tesla noted that it was prioritising “quality above all else”.The fourth-quarter figures brought its 2015 deliveries to 50,580, the low end of its guidance. However, analysts noted that the automaker had lowered its outlook through the year.Chinese equities plunged on Monday amid concerns about the health of its economy, prompting Beijing to use its circuit breaker rule. That set the tone for global markets. .US-listed shares in Chinese companies were punished, with shares in ecommerce site Alibaba down 5.64 per cent to $76.69.Shares in Baidu, a search engine group, fell 2.65 per cent to $184.03 while shares in Cheetah Mobile fell 2.87 per cent to $15.56.The sell-off in Chinese stocks also weighed on shares of Macau casino operators, though their shares had recovered most of their losses by the close. Wynn Resorts was down 0.61 per cent at $68.77, Las Vegas Sands was down 1 per cent to $43.40, and Melco Crown Entertainment was off 0.77 per cent to $16.67.All 10 big sectors on the benchmark S&P 500 were in the red.

26;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2015-12-17T23:40:28Z;Adelson family confirms purchase of Nevada’s biggest newspaper;Family of casino magnate ‘proud’ to buy Las Vegas Review-Journal;"The family of Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and prolific donor to Republican political candidates, has confirmed they were the anonymous buyer of Nevada’s largest newspaper, ending a mystery that had engrossed US media watchers.The Adelson family said in a statement in Thursday’s issue of the Las Vegas Review-Journal that they were “proud” to announce they had purchased the paper “through a wholly-owned fund, as both a financial investment as well as an investment in the future of the Las Vegas community”.The family said it “was always our intention to publicly announce our ownership” but that it had waited until after this week’s Republican debate, which was held at one of Mr Adelson’s casinos. “We did not want an announcement to distract from the important role Nevada continues to play in the presidential election,” they wrote.Mr Adelson’s involvement in the $140m purchase of the paper was first reported by Fortune magazine and confirmed by the paper itself, which said Patrick Dumont, Mr Adelson’s son-in-law, had put together the deal on behalf of the chief executive and chairman of Las Vegas Sands, the casino operator.Speculation had been swirling since the sale of the paper and several smaller outlets in the state late last week to News + Media Capital Group at a steep premium of seven times adjusted earnings. The seller, New Media Investment Group, had bought the paper along with other titles for $102m earlier this year.News + Media, newly incorporated in Delaware, was described as having “undisclosed financial backers with expertise in the media industry”. Few people within the newspaper knew the identity of the buyer, sparking protests by some of its journalists and calls for transparency from media observers.Mr Adelson’s name emerged as a likely buyer on the theory that Nevada’s richest man and a political donor would have an interest in owning the leading newspaper in a swing state. The Review-Journal reported that Mr Adelson had unsuccessfully bid for the paper earlier this year.In its statement on Thursday, the Adelson family said its motivation for the purchase was that “we believe deeply that a strong and effective daily newspaper plays a critical role in keeping our state apprised of the important news and issues we face on a daily basis.”Forbes estimates Mr Adelson’s net worth at $24.5bn. He was the single biggest donor in the 2012 presidential race and is being aggressively courted by the Republican field this year.Mr Adelson is the son of Lithuanian immigrants who got his first job as a boy selling newspapers after school. He first became wealthy when he created the Comdex computer trade show, but it was his development of the Venetian gaming resort and expansion to Macau and Singapore that vaulted him into the ranks of the world’s wealthiest men.He is known for his strong support of Israel and in 2007 founded Israel Hayom, a free Tel Aviv newspaper that backs Benjamin Netanyahu. He also owns Makor Rishon, the conservative Jerusalem weekly.shannon.bond@ft.com

27;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2015-10-05T13:21:21Z;Theft jeopardises casino model in Macau;Junket promoter’s loss adds to pressure from Chinese downturn and Xi’s campaign against corruption;For years, shadowy middlemen know as junkets fuelled the growth of the world’s biggest gambling centre, navigating legal restrictions and generating billions of dollars for Sheldon Adelson and Steven Wynn, the US casino tycoons, and their Chinese counterparts.But gambling promoters in Macau now face their biggest challenge after the theft of millions of dollars from Dore Entertainment, a casino promoter. The theft shook investor confidence and prompted street protests at a time when the corruption crackdown and economic slowdown in China were already hitting the territory hard.Now the government of the former Portuguese colony and the only part of China where casinos are legal is considering tougher regulations and investors have been pulling their money out of junkets as the operators warn of hard times ahead.“You’ve got junket investors who have been a little worried about their investments for a while because they’re watching the market implode,” says Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming Research in Macau. “Then along comes the Dore situation with the alleged theft and it’s giving junket investors one more reason to say, ‘I’m out’.”Hong Kong-listed Neptune, one of the biggest junket operators, warned that it could withdraw from the business because it faces “pressing concerns”, scrambling to reduce mounting losses at a time when its financial position is “extremely vulnerable”.It said that “deepening economic fears about China”, which have caused a global stock market sell-off, were “forcing a broad rethinking of our business strategy”.Other junket operators have already started looking away from Macau, launching casino projects from Vanuatu to the Cape Verde Islands.Macau’s casinos expanded at a dizzying pace in the decade before President Xi Jinping launched his fight against graft in 2013. The junkets played a vital role in helping gaming revenue hit a peak of $45bn that year, most of it generated from high-rollers playing in luxurious private rooms.While casinos in other jurisdictions typically market and extend credit to these VIP gamblers themselves, this is not possible in China because of currency controls, a ban on the promotion of betting and the fact that the collection of gambling debts is not legally enforceable.$45bnGaming revenue in Macau in 2013The junkets, run by listed companies, celebrities and individuals with underworld connections, overcome restrictions, bringing in as much as 85 per cent of the VIP business that accounts for more than half of gaming revenue.“They exist in a grey zone bounded by risk-based and hands-off Macau government regulation on the one end and questionable or illegal business methods on the other,” Gambling Compliance, a London business that advises betting companies on regulation, concluded in a report last year. “Junkets defy the spirit of Chinese and Macau government financial restrictions by running a de facto cash transfer and/or lending service.”To raise the vast amounts of cash they need to fund China’s high-rollers, the junket operators have looked to private investors as well as gamblers themselves, offering monthly interest rates of 1-2 per cent.But the Dore incident, which involved a cage manager allegedly stealing millions of dollars, has raised questions about the sustainability of the industry model.As China’s anti-corruption campaign dents revenues in the city, officials and casino operators are adapting their business modelRead more“We don’t know if or how quickly we’ll reach that tipping point where liquidity is a bigger problem than demand,” says Mr Govertsen of Union Gaming. “But liquidity represents a real risk to a further decline in the VIP business over the coming months.”Kai Tan, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong, believes the bigger problem facing the casino industry in Macau is still dropping demand as business owners facing declining profits and falling asset prices shun the baccarat tables.Gaming revenue fell by an annualised 33 per cent to $2.1bn in September, the 16th straight month of shrinkage.“We are still negative on Macau but the main reason is because of the slowing Chinese economy and we don’t see a recovery yet,” says Mr Tan.Analysts can only guess at the real extent of the liquidity pressures facing the junket operators because of their complex and opaque ownership structure and a lack of publicly available data.But no one doubts that the heat is on as Beijing continues its anti-corruption drive.“The junkets are going to be under increasing pressure,” says Jeffrey Fiedler of the International Union of Operating Engineers, a US trade union that watches the Macau casino industry closely because of the extensive involvement of US companies such as Las Vegas Sands, Wynn and MGM Resorts. “I don’t think the mainland cares as much about the gaming industry in Macau as it does about the survivability of the Communist party and the relationship of corruption to that survivability. So the mainland is being pretty tough and I have every expectation that they will continue to be.”
28;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2015-10-02T17:04:19Z;Slower revenue fall boosts Macau casinos;Possible government aid for the region’s economy also helps;Shares of Macau casino operators jumped on Friday as the decline in gaming revenues slowed in September and on reports that the Chinese government was considering measures to support the region’s economy.Gross gaming revenue fell 33 per cent in September from the previous year to 17.1bn patacas ($2.1bn), according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.That figure compared with a 35.5 per cent drop reported in August and was much lower than the 49 per cent drop recorded in February.Local media reports that the Chinese government would support Macau’s growth “in all aspects” also gave casino stocks a shot in the arm.The crackdown on corruption and the economic slowdown in China has weighed on casino operators in Macau, with gaming revenues declining for 16 months straight, although the rate of decline has slowed over the past seven months.Junket operators, who lend to high-stakes Chinese VIP gamblers, also took a hit last month on reports that an employee had stolen investor capital from junket operator Dore Entertainment.Kenneth Fong, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said junkets reserved more capital to brace for withdrawals following the Dore incident, which “led to a temporary slowdown in revenue in the middle of September as system liquidity tightened”. However, the junket operators have said “liquidity has since then stabilised”. They added that they are “cautiously optimistic on mass traffic” ahead of the important Golden Week holiday in China.Wynn Resorts was the biggest gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 with shares up 23 per cent to $63.47. Shares in Las Vegas Sands advanced more than 10 per cent to $40.87, shares in Melco Crown Entertainment gained 14 per cent to $15.51 and MGM Resorts International shares climbed 6 per cent to $19.79.Nordstrom announced a special cash dividend of $4.85 a share and an additional $1bn share buyback programme after the market closed on Thursday. The news pushed shares of the luxury goods retailer 5 per cent higher to $75.08.Micron Technology shares climbed 8 per cent to $15.91 after the chipmaker reported better than expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and said the outlook for memory chips looked favourable in the long term.Profits fell 59 per cent from a year ago to $471m or 42 cents a share, but well ahead of analysts’ expectations for earnings of 29 cents a share. Sales declined 15 per cent to $3.6bn, modestly ahead of forecasts.Favourable supply dynamics for its memory chip along with “Micron’s technology progress, and emergence of new categories of demand with smartwatch[es] and car[s], would allow Micron to grow its revenues and earnings faster than its peer group of tech companies over the next 12 to 18 months”, Sundeep Bajikar, an analyst at Jefferies said.Shares in Gilead Sciences slid as much as 2.4 per cent to $95.99 after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and maintained their $127 price target. Valeant Pharmaceuticals shares also fell 2 per cent after Morgan Stanley analysts cut their rating on the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and lowered their target price to $200 from $284. Valeant rebounded to close 1.6 per cent higher on the day.US stocks sold off after the latest report from the labour department showed the economy created 142,000 jobs in September and downwardly revised August’s figures.By end of day, however, the main indices had pared their losses. The S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent to 1,951.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 16,472.37, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.7 per cent at 4,707.77.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
29;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2015-09-16T05:57:06Z;Sands China taps Beijing-linked outsider as COO;Casino operator seeks tighter ties to government as it weathers Macau storm;Sands China has turned to a gaming outsider with political links to Beijing as its new chief operating officer, an effort to strengthen ties to government as the sector struggles with tumbling revenue.The Hong Kong-listed unit of Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands has chosen Wilfred Wong, a former construction executive, to take on the role of chief operating officer and president, replacing Rob Goldstein following his move to the US parent company.“Wilfred has a unique combination of private and public sector experience we think will be invaluable to the company at this point in our history,” said Mr Adelson, chairman of both Sands China and Las Vegas Sands, in a statement.Mr Wong was a member of China’s National People’s Congress from 2007-2012 and has served in various posts in both the Hong Kong and central government.Analysts at Bernstein Research pointed to his “strong ties” to the Chinese government as the key to his appointment, adding that they expect his main responsibility to be acting as a liaison with officials in Macau and Beijing.“We view this announcement as positive to Sands China as it strengthens the management team in Macau and adds an important element to government relations,” they wrote in a note.Sands China shares were up 4.3 per cent in afternoon trading on Wednesday, in line with gains for the rest of the sector and the broader Hong Kong market.Share prices in the gaming sector have been hammered during the downturn. Sands China has fallen more than 40 per cent in the past 12 months, Wynn Macau has halved, and SJM Holdings, the casino business of Hong Kong tycoon Stanley Ho, is down by almost two-thirds.Earlier this year the Macau government began a review of the gaming sector. A key issue is the renewal of the six gaming concessions on the Cotai Strip, where Sands China’s Venetian casino and hotel complex is due to be joined by the $2.7bn Parisian next year. Sands China’s current license runs until 2022.The appointment of Mr Wong, most recently chairman and chief executive of Hong Kong-based Hsin Chong Construction — which has been involved in all of Sands China’s Macau properties, including the Parisian — comes as Macau’s casino sector grapples with tumbling revenue caused by China’s crackdown on corruption, lavish spending, and illicit capital flight.Though still profitable, operators have been reeling from a sharp slowdown in income from gambling in the former Portuguese territory, the only place in China where casino betting is legal. Total sector revenue sank 36 per cent in August, according to official figures, the 15th straight month of decline.Jamie Soo, Daiwa analyst, expects further contraction in the sector in 2016, as the impact of renminbi depreciation, an extended smoking ban at casinos and China’s economic slowdown are added to the industry’s list of challenges.
30;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2015-07-02T09:09:48Z;Macau casinos start winning after reversal in China visa policy;Relaxed restrictions for mainland transit visitors buoy gambling stocks;Shares in Macau’s casino companies jumped more than 10 per cent on Thursday in a rare relief rally after the semi-autonomous Chinese territory relaxed visa restrictions for visitors from the mainland.After a decade of breakneck casino expansion, Macau saw its first annual fall in gaming revenue last year as Chinese president Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive scared off many of the mainland high rollers who had been pumping up gaming profits in the tiny former Portuguese territory.The Hong Kong-listed shares in the leading Macau casino operators have fallen over the past year, but they rebounded after the Macau government on Wednesday reversed limits on mainland transit visitors that were brought in 12 months ago, following pressure from Beijing.“This is the first sign of policy easing since the downturn began in Macau,” said Anil Daswani, an analyst at Citigroup. “The transit visa policy significantly hit premium mass gross gaming revenue since the second quarter of 2014 and this reversal was much needed to rekindle growth in the volatile Macau market.”Macau generated gross gaming revenue of 17.4bn patacas ($2.2bn) in June, down 36 per cent compared with the same period last year but slightly better than analysts’ expectations.In a broadly flat Hong Kong market, shares in Sands China, the local subsidiary of casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, surged 12.1 per cent to HK$29.25 but have still lost half of their value over the past year. Shares in Steve Wynn’s Wynn Macau rose 13.8 per cent to HK$14.72 and MGM China leapt 15.9 per cent to HK$14.70.Hong Kong markets were closed on Wednesday for a public holiday.Analysts said the share price rises were supported by hedge funds buying the stocks to close short positions, which they took out previously as they bet that Macau’s prospects would deteriorate.“The sector has been a favourite among local hedge funds and some of that would have been unwound today,” said Mr Daswani.Macau, the world’s biggest casino market by gaming revenue, continues to face significant challenges.More than $20bn of long-planned new casinos are being opened over the next two years, a big expansion in supply at a time when demand remains weak.A planned smoking ban, too, could deter punters. Smoking has already been banned on the main casino floors but the Macau government is considering extending this to VIP rooms and removing airport-style smoking lounges.Mr Daswani said that while preventing high rollers from smoking as they gamble could cut VIP revenues by a further 5-20 per cent, he was hopeful that the smoking lounges would stay, given the government’s about-turn on mainland visitor restrictions.Praveen Choudhary, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, argued that it was too soon to call the bottom for the Macau casino market, however.“Many would consider two recent news items as signs of the bottom,” he said. “[The] complete smoking ban could be seen as removal of a longstanding overhang and relaxation of transit visas [the] end of tight regulation. We disagree.”He argued that the transit visa adjustment would not change the fundamental pattern of reduced VIP gambling by mainland Chinese and that the smoking ban was likely to be implemented.
31;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2015-01-01T18:39:22Z;US internet gambling campaign stalls;Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson leads anti-liberalisation drive;Efforts to allow internet gambling across the US have stalled, after a campaign backed by casino owners pushed back against industry efforts to allow more widespread wagering on laptops and smartphones.New Jersey, Delaware and Nevada became the first states to liberalise online betting in 2013, prompting industry executives to predict that longstanding prohibitions on the practice would soon crumble as others followed their example.“Make no mistake: internet gaming is here to stay,” said Geoff Freeman, the new president of the American Gaming Association, told Congress in December 2013, noting that a dozen more states were also considering online play.Instead, 12 months later, revenues from the three states have failed to come close to lofty expectations, and quarrelling within the industry has shelved hopes for further expansion.The momentum began to slow just three months after Mr Freeman’s declaration, when casino mogul Sheldon Adelson used his presence on the AGA board to persuade the group to withdraw its support for online betting. Mr Adelson, the billionaire chairman of Las Vegas Sands, pledged to spend “whatever it takes” to stop internet gaming.The reversal dismayed other AGA members, such as Caesars and MGM Resorts, which had been vigorously pushing for a federal framework for internet gambling.Mr Adelson and his allies then helped derail attempts to legalise online play in California and Pennsylvania, although they were unsuccessful in pushing for a provision in a Congressional spending bill to restore a blanket federal ban.The 1961 Wire Act prohibited wagering via electronic transmissions, but in late 2011 the Justice Department reversed its interpretation of the law to allow individual states to establish their own internet betting schemes.New Jersey, by far the largest market of the three to do so in 2013, registered just $111.8m in revenues over its first 12 months — well shy of the $1bn projections offered by analysts and state officials at the outset.Some attribute the poor performance to a miscalculation of consumer demand and technical glitches, while others point out that banks have been reluctant to clear online gambling transactions — a problem that has caused similar headaches for the emerging legal marijuana industry.The 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, which the Justice Department used to go after offshore poker operators in 2011, has been an important obstacle.“Under [UIGEA], failing to block restricted transactions could result in liability. But there is no liability for over-blocking or refusing to honour Internet gambling-related transactions. This was a carefully considered provision designed to make it much more difficult for internet casinos to operate,” said Michael Borden, an attorney with Sidley Austin and former congressional aide who helped draft the law.Proponents of liberalisation in New Jersey point out that its problems have been strictly financial. There were no reported cases of online casinos being used for the nefarious purposes that Mr Adelson has warned about, such as money laundering by terrorists and crime syndicates, nor was there any reported gaming by underage players.“From a regulatory perspective, our systems are working very well,” said David Rebuck, director of New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement. “There have been no systematic failures that would in any way impugn the overall integrity of our operations.”Advocates of further US online expansion are now pinning their hopes on a renewed push in California to legalise online poker and an attempt by PokerStars, now owned by Amaya Gaming of Montreal, to obtain a New Jersey license after being denied in 2013 over previous run-ins with the Justice Department.Should PokerStars be approved, it will operate an online poker platform in conjunction with Resorts Casino in Atlantic City. The success or failure of the world’s largest online poker operator is likely to determine whether internet gambling makes any more headway in the US in 2015.aaron.stanley@ft.comTwitter: @astanley2772
32;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2014-08-26T17:34:08Z;Best Buy slump continues on weak sales;US retailer struggles to compete with online competitors;Best Buy continued a year-long slump on Tuesday after it reported weaker than expected sales, as it struggles to compete with online retailers and fails to ignite interest in flashier televisions that made it a retail juggernaut in the 1990s.The company said same-store sales fell 2.7 per cent in the quarter to August 2, more than Wall Street analysts had expected. Net revenues slipped 4 per cent from a year earlier to $8.9bn.Profits dipped to $146m, or 42 cents a share, in the quarter from $266m, or 77 cents, the previous year. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 31 cents per share.Hubert Joly, Best Buy chief executive, said the company was grappling with a difficult retail environment, noting overall consumer electronics sales tracked by research group NPD slid 2.5 per cent in the period.“Like other retailers and as reflected in this quarter’s performance, we continued to see a shift in consumer behaviour: consumers are increasingly researching and buying online,” he said.Brian Nagel, an analyst at Oppenheimer, echoed a note of caution, forecasting a difficult second half of the year as competitors encroach on the electronics market.Best Buy shares declined 7 per cent to $29.81, erasing some $760m from the retailer’s valuation.The company’s shares are among the 10 worst-performing on the benchmark S&P 500 this year, trailing only Mattel, Staples, Whole Foods and Coach.Mobileye jumped after at least eight investment banks initiated coverage of the Israeli technology company following its initial public offering earlier this month.A majority of the analysts who started covering the company, including those with Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Wells Fargo, recommended the stock as a “buy” on Tuesday, citing strong growth prospects as carmakers increase their use of Mobileye’s technology.The company makes software, chips and other applications that process visual data to stop cars from colliding. Its customers include BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan and Volvo.“Mobileye is at the centre of arguably the most powerful automotive megatrend in history – active safety and autonomous mobility,” Itay Michaeli, an analyst with Citi, said. “This isn’t just another regulatory-driven penetration story, but also arguably the auto industry’s ‘iPhone’ moment.”Mobileye shares advanced 8 per cent to $41.43.The US and Chinese gambling sectors were under pressure after brokerage Morgan Stanley trimmed its forecasts for Macau gaming growth, as decelerating Chinese economic activity weighs on visits to the world’s betting hub.Analysts with the bank now expect full-year gaming revenues in Macau to rise 6 per cent in 2014 from a year earlier, compared to an earlier 12 per cent forecast.The tempered forecast comes despite the bank’s belief that activity has stabilised in Macau following two straight months of declines, which Morgan Stanley attributed to the World Cup.Stronger volumes and busier floors in August, which have yet to be confirmed by Macau’s gaming bureau, would not offset other headwinds, Thomas Allen, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said.Mr Allen highlighted a change made to transit visa rules, which reduced the length of time Chinese passport-holders can spend in Macau from seven to five days, as well as a forthcoming smoking ban, for some of the expected difficulty.The visa change was “impacting both VIP and mass players’ ability to get to Macau as often as some would like”, he said.Shares of Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts slipped roughly 1 per cent to $67.85 and $199.28, respectively. Shares in Pinnacle Entertainment and MGM Resorts were relatively flat.Overall, US equities continued a two-day advance as consumer confidence climbed to a seven-year high and durable goods orders eclipsed Wall Street expectations.The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,000.02.

33;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2014-06-03T17:05:06Z;Casinos sink on Macau spin of wheel;;US casino operators fell broadly as the latest gambling figures from Macau, the world’s gaming hub, fell short of Wall Street expectations.Overall gaming revenues rose 9.3 per cent from a year earlier to 32.4bn Macanese patacas, or $4.1bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.Analysts on average had expected a rise between 13 and 15 per cent.Since the year’s start, revenues have reached roughly $20.8bn, or 16 per cent higher than the year ago level.Analysts with Citigroup said much of the weakness in the sector – the Dow Jones US Gambling Index has fallen 13 per cent over the past three months – has been due to recent reports of “crackdowns on illegal use of Union Pay Cards, transit visas and junkets running away”, which they say are overblown.“Adding to pressure, in May the Macau government announced that a full smoking ban in the mass gaming areas will be implemented,” analyst Anil Daswani said.“Again, we believe these fears are overdone as the ban will not apply to premium mass or VIP.”Citi added the addition of new rooms would likely lift overall growth in the sector in the coming years.Wynn Resorts fell 4.49 per cent to close at $208.23, Las Vegas Sands dipped 2.57 per cent to $75.44 and MGM Resorts International declined almost 3 per cent to end the day at $25.83.Dollar General stuck to its profit forecast even as consumers spend more on lower-margin items at a US discount chain that has fared well since the financial crisis.The company, which is based in Tennessee, said it was generating lower profits from its sales as shoppers buy more “lower-margin consumables” such as tobacco and candy.While Dollar General stuck to a prediction that it will make between $3.45 and $3.55 a share in the current financial year, it cautioned “the volatility of the macroeconomic environment continues to pressure the consumer”.Overall, sales climbed almost 7 per cent to $4.52bn in the quarter to May 2. Net income rose to $222m from $220m.Shares in the company advanced 3.85 per cent to close at $56.39.Hillshire Brands, the US company behind Jimmy Dean sausages, said it will start talks with both Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson Foods over the takeover bids that the companies have each made.Shares in Hillshire jumped about 9.5 per cent to close at $58.65 after Pilgrim’s Pride confirmed it had raised its offer from $45 a share to $55 a share in cash.Pilgrim’s Pride shares fell 2.24 per cent to $25.34 while Tyson declined just over 3 per cent to $42.07.Tyson Foods has an offer of $50 a share, or roughly $6.8bn, on the table.The fight for Hillshire, which itself is trying to buy rival food producer Pinnacle, comes as companies seek to wrestle pricing power from retailers, global groups seek growth in new markets and conglomerates reshuffle their brand portfolios.US carmakers advanced on Tuesday as General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all topped monthly sales expectations.Any reputational damage that General Motors has incurred because of its mass recall of cars has yet to reach showrooms in the US.Sales of its vehicles rose 12.6 per cent in May from a year earlier, almost double the tally that analysts had forecast.Although the figures echo the strong performance across the industry last month, they also underline that the decision by GM chief executive Mary Barra to recall more than 10m cars in the US has not put off consumers.Ford reported a 3 per cent rise in US sales in May. Ford shares rose 0.64 per cent to $16.55 while General Motors climbed 1.12 per cent to close at $35.25.Overall, US equity markets closed slightly lower. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.04 per cent to 1,924.24 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.13 per cent to 16,722.34.

34;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2014-05-09T10:50:01Z;Malaysia’s Genting to take $4bn gamble on Las Vegas Strip casino;;Malaysia’s Genting Group, one of Asia’s biggest casino operators, is poised to challenge US dominance of the Las Vegas Strip with a $4bn plan to build a casino and resort in the same location.The move is the culmination of two years’ work to break into the Nevada gaming scene and marks a coup for Genting, which has grown since its 1965 founding in southeast Asia by the Lim family to become one of Asia’s most ambitious casino operators.The plan also highlights how Asia casino operators are prepared to move into the heartland of the US gaming industry after years in which the casino operators of Las Vegas – led by Sheldon Adelson with his Las Vegas Sands business – have made inroads into Asian gaming in Macau and Singapore.Genting will build its development on the site of the Stardust casino, which was demolished in 2007 on the same site as the original casino of the same name built in 1958 on South Las Vegas Boulevard.The company said the complex would “create tens of thousands of jobs [and] generate hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue” for Nevada.A first phase of the project will include a 100,000 sq ft gambling floor, a 3,000-room hotel tower and an aquarium. A second phase will include more space for gambling, a 1m sq ft convention centre, water park and cinema.Construction will begin in the second half of 2014 on a 87-acre site that Genting bought two years ago from Boyd Gaming. The project, Resorts World Las Vegas – taking its name from the Resorts World brand used in Asia – is due to be completed in 24-36 months, the group said.“Our goal at Resorts World Las Vegas is to complement existing properties and bring a new and unique entertainment destination to the Las Vegas Strip.” said KT Lim, Genting chairman.“Our themed resort will cater to the high-end visitor as well as the budget-minded tourist.”Gaming revenues in Asia are projected to grow almost a fifth a year to 2015, according to PwC, compared with 5 per cent annual growth in the US. However, the lower US growth has not deterred Genting, which is poised to open further casinos in Florida and Massachusetts, on top of an existing facility in New York opened in 2011.Sam Yin, analyst at Maybank in Kuala Lumpur, where Genting Group is listed, said that while the project was “potentially lucrative”, gross gaming revenues on the Las Vegas Strip had fallen in the first three months of this year to $1.6bn, down from $1.7bn in the same period a year earlier.“Our estimates could be at risk if it does not grow fast enough to accommodate Resorts World Las Vegas,” he said.
35;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2014-05-02T22:00:46Z;Wynn Resorts gains on Macau gambling data;US equities little moved after strong non-farm payrolls;Wynn Resorts led a surging casino industry on Friday as the latest gambling figures from Macau, the world’s gaming hub, showed a resilient Chinese business that has benefited from new infrastructure and rail connections.Gaming revenues in Macau increased 11 per cent from a year earlier to 31.1bn patacas, or $3.9bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. For the year, sales are running 18 per cent above last year’s levels. The rise was above analyst expectations for a 7 per cent advance.The figures followed better than expected quarterly earnings from Wynn, which said sales rose 14 per cent from a year earlier to $1.5bn. Profits climbed 12 per cent to $227m, or $2.22 per diluted share.Wynn said it remained on track to open its latest 1,700 room resort in Macau in the first half of 2016 and both mass market and VIP segments in Macau showed 20 per cent plus growth. Analysts on Wall Street said they expected strong growth to continue, even as new hotels open over the next few years.“May Golden Week is off to a very strong start, with record mass market crowds in Macau over the past four days,” Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said. “Even our most sceptical contacts in Macau are surprised at the crowds they’ve seen this week.”Shares of Wynn rose 7.3 per cent to $221.68, while MGM Resorts advanced 4.3 per cent to $26.49 and Las Vegas Sands increased 1.6 per cent to $80.60.Cosmetics and beauty company Estée Lauder was cheered by investors after reporting renewed momentum in several emerging markets.The company enjoyed an increase in sales in China and Latin America during the first three months of the year, helping lift overall sales 11 per cent to $2.5bn.Profits, in turn, rose by almost a fifth to $213.2m, or 54 cents a share, from $178.8m, or 45 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Shares in the company advanced 4.7 per cent to $75.62.LinkedIn slid as much as 8.3 per cent after the company said it expected full-year sales to be in a range between $2.06bn and $2.08bn, shy of Wall Street expectations.The guidance offset better than expected first-quarter results. Sales rose 46 per cent from a year earlier to $473m. LinkedIn swung to a loss of $13m, or 11 cents per share, compared with a profit of $23m in the first quarter of 2013.Adjusting for certain items, the company said it earned 38 cents per share, four cents ahead of forecasts. LinkedIn’s hiring solutions business – which accounts for more than half of sales – continued to slow.Tech companies, including Amazon and Twitter, have been hard hit for reporting slowing growth this quarter, however slight. Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch point out that, with US equity markets still near records, misses are being punished more than beats are being rewarded.“The focus appears to be shifting back to fundamentals, as post-reporting performance spreads widened last week,” equity strategist Savita Subramanian said.Skechers shares dipped after it announced it was interested in purchasing the Los Angeles Clippers, the US basketball team whose owner was recorded making alleged racist remarks.The maker of trainers said on Friday it was exploring acquiring an interest in the team. The National Basketball Association commissioner, Adam Silver, said this week that he would do “everything in my power” to force Donald Sterling, the current owner, to sell.Shares in Skechers fell 4.8 per cent to $39.93.Overall, US equities were little moved after the monthly non-farm payrolls report showed weaker than expected wage growth, even as overall payrolls expanded at the greatest rate since early 2012.The S&P 500 was down 0.13 per cent at 1,881.14 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.28 per cent to 16,512.89. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite nudged down slightly to 4,123.90.
36;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;South Korea raises stakes in gamble for Chinese punters;;Jeju Island’s white beaches and volcanic landscape are a source of pride for South Koreans, but its roulette tables and slot machines have been another driver behind a surge in Chinese visits over the past five years.Last year, 1.8m Chinese visited Jeju, 120km from the southern tip of the Korean peninsula – up from 175,000 visitors in 2008, with many of them coming to try their luck in the island’s eight casinos.The gambling boom in Jeju and other parts of South Korea is gathering pace, as the government steps up efforts to attract Chinese tourists by encouraging development in the sector.It is one of a growing number of Asian nations angling for a share of the rapidly expanding Chinese gambling market. Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam are all poised to legalise casinos and take on the established hubs of Macau and Singapore.Las Vegas-based Caesars Entertainment and Hong Kong-listed Lippo won provisional approval this month for a casino resort on an island 40km from central Seoul. Plans include hotels, a convention centre and luxury shops.“Gambling is seen as a vice in Korea,” says Yang Il-woo, an analyst at Samsung Securities. “But the government wants to have more casino operators to boost the economy by increasing employment and generating tax revenue.”Progressive easing of visa requirements for Chinese visitors has contributed to annual average revenue growth for the South Korean casino sector of 7.5 per cent over the past five years to more than $2.5bn in 2013, according to analysts at Macquarie, who predict a quickening to 11 per cent over the next three years. Shares in Paradise, the biggest South Korean casino operator by sales, have risen to 11 times their level in mid-2010.South Korea’s casino revenues are still a fraction of the roughly $45bn generated in Macau last year, but Seoul and Jeju are much closer to Beijing and other big eastern cities, notes Lee Hyuk-byung, head of Paradise’s casino business. And as minimum bets rise at Macau’s crowded casinos, Chinese customers can receive VIP treatment in South Korea – Paradise offers free flights and a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce – if they pledge to bet $50,000, which would see them categorised as “premium mass” punters in Macau, he adds.Paradise will this year begin development of a casino-centred “integrated resort” close to Caesars’ proposed site near Seoul, while its main rival Grand Korea Leisure is considering a similar project either in Jeju or the southern city of Busan. Genting Singapore last month announced its plans for a huge casino resort on Jeju, with a projected development cost of $2.2bn.The government promised last month to ease strict financial requirements for casino operators, while the decision to approve Caesars’ project was made “with a goal of supporting the economy and fostering the tourism industry”, Kim Ki-hong, an official at the culture and tourism ministry, said.But beneath such supportive statements lies a deep ambivalence in government towards the casino industry. Casinos – originally reliant on Japanese custom – have operated for decades in South Korea, but the only one open to South Korean customers is Gangwon Land, an isolated mountain resort opened in 2003 that is deliberately located several hours’ drive from the nearest city.The broad ban on “open” casinos and concerns about regulation rule out investment by leading international casino groups such as MGM Resorts International, says Alan Feldman, head of government relations for the company.Korean casino industry regulations do not meet international standards in areas such as anti-money laundering and “know your customer” rules, he says, preventing MGM from operating there for fear of jeopardising its Nevada operating licence, which requires it to adhere to a strict code of conduct across the world.Additionally, the “foreigners only” law makes MGM deem it unfeasible to develop one of the vast casino complexes that it favours, and Mr Feldman sees no sign of a government volte-face in the near future. “Meanwhile, the conversations in Japan have heated up quite significantly,” he adds.Japan is widely expected to pass legislation to allow casinos this year – a prospect that has sparked excitement among operators. “We will spend whatever it takes [to invest in Japan],” Sheldon Adelson, chief executive of Las Vegas Sands, said last month.“Once the casinos open in Japan, they will take some of our customers – many Japanese and Chinese,” says Mr Lee. But the change in Japan could precipitate a windfall for Korean casinos by forcing the government to reconsider its strict regulations, he adds. “That’s the time when serious discussion about open casinos will start in Korea.”
37;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2014-03-05T09:25:29Z;International groups dealt weak hand in Japan’s casino gamble;;The Japanese lawmaker spearheading a push to legalise casino gambling in the country has warned international gaming groups that they will struggle to win licences without taking on local partners.The move is a rebuke to foreigners such as Sheldon Adelson, billionaire chief executive of Las Vegas Sands, who want to crack the potentially vast new market on their own.Takeshi Iwaya told the Financial Times in an interview that he was “extremely worried” that a legalisation bill that is expected to pass parliament by midyear could be delayed by procedural issues, even though it enjoys multi-party support.“Of course we need foreign companies’ expertise and knowledge, but they may have trouble adapting to Japan’s particular characteristics,” Mr Iwaya said. “Ideally, foreign companies with rich expertise would join forces with Japanese groups.”The number of casinos that would be licensed initially remains unknown. Mr Iwaya laid out a scenario involving four resorts, one each in two big cities – Tokyo, the capital and Olympic host city, is widely seen as a shoo-in for one – and two more in outlying regions. Together they would generate Y2tn ($19.5bn) in gaming income, he said.“Once you add related industries, the effect could be double that, maybe even Y5tn,” he said. “We’re talking about adding full percentage point of GDP.”Mr Iwaya heads a group of 210 lawmakers who have been rallying support for what would be Japan’s first casino resorts, projects that some believe could turn Japan into a big regional gambling destination to rival Macau and Singapore.The ruling Liberal Democratic party, to which he belongs, has endorsed the bill as have several smaller parties.The only obstacle to the bill’s passage in the current session of parliament, which is scheduled to end in June, is the legislature’s busy agenda, he said. The cabinet affairs committee, which must review the bill before it is presented to the full legislature, has seven pieces of government-proposed legislation to debate in addition to the private member casino bill.“They have to get through the government bills first, so I am extremely worried,” Mr Iwaya said, though he added that he remained confident the bill would ultimately pass. “We have the Olympics coming in 2020, and although this isn’t strictly related to the Olympics, there is a consensus that we need to put more effort into tourism.”The prospect of a new gambling market in the world’s third-largest economy – one adjacent to high-rolling China – has excited international casino operators. At an investor conference in Tokyo last week that was attended by executives of several major Las Vegas-based groups, Mr Adelson said he was willing to spend “whatever it takes”. to build in JapanBut while he conceded that he was “not ruling it out” working with local partners, he said he would prefer to work alone and argued that Sands, the world’s most valuable gaming company and an owner of casinos elsewhere in Asia, had enough money and experience to do so. “These people can’t keep up,” he said of other would-be operators.Mr Iwaya laughed when recalling what he described as the “bold” remarks by Mr Adelson. “We have no intention of keeping out foreign groups,” he said, before adding, “Japanese people have a unique mentality. If an outsider tried to do everything alone they might find they didn’t fit in.”If the casino bill passes, a second round of more detailed legislation would still be required to set gambling regulations and licensing requirements, and formal proposals for Japan’s first casino projects would not be considered for perhaps two more years. Mr Iwaya will not be in charge of granting licences, but he is an influential voice in the debate and his views on foreign access are widely shared.“In this country, it simply doesn’t happen that foreigners come in and do big projects completely on their own,” said Takashi Kiso, a gaming industry consultant.
38;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2014-03-02T05:45:40Z;Japan’s gamble with casino licences sets pulses racing;;At the Japan Casino School in Tokyo, students can train as blackjack dealers or take specialised English courses so as to better direct the world’s gamblers to place their bets.The one thing they cannot do is get a job in Japan after graduation. Casino gambling remains illegal in the country, even as it has flourished in nearby jurisdictions such as Macau and Singapore. That looks likely to change soon, however: a law that would allow the first casino licences to be issued is expected to pass parliament this year.The prospect of the world’s third-largest economy opening itself to casinos has excited the gaming industry. CLSA, a brokerage, estimates that with a dozen or so facilities Japan could generate $40bn in revenues a year – compared with about $51bn a year in Macau and $7bn in Singapore. That seems more than feasible, given the size of Japan and its proximity to China, with its seemingly limitless supply of high rollers.At an investor conference sponsored by CLSA in Tokyo last week, Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire chief executive of the Las Vegas Sands group, which runs casinos elsewhere in Asia, promised to pour vast resources into Japan if his company were allowed to build.“We will spend whatever it takes,” he said. “Would I put in $10bn? Yes. Would I rather do it at seven? Yes.”Japan’s casino lobby has been pushing for 15 years, ever since Shintaro Ishihara, then the governor of Tokyo, declared in 1999 that he wanted to open a casino in the capital. Japan already allows betting on horse, boat and bicycle races, as well as lotteries and pachinko, a version of pinball whose operators have found ways around anti-gambling laws and dole out cash prizes.South Koreans in search of a game of roulette must either leave the country or take a trip to the isolated mountain resort of Kangwon Land – deliberately situated several hours’ drive from the nearest city.The government’s squeamishness about allowing its citizens to gamble contrasts with its growing appetite for the business of foreign punters, particularly from China.South Korea has 16 “foreigners-only” casinos, mostly clustered in Seoul and the holiday island of Jeju. Revenue at these casinos increased from $657m in 2007 to $1.1bn in 2012, according to the brokerage CLSA, and analysts expect this growth to continue.Takashi Kiso was a student when Mr Ishihara made his pitch. He enrolled at the University of Nevada Las Vagas to learn the gambling trade, only to see the legalisation movement founder. Today he is a consultant in Tokyo, with a roster of clients who hope to break into the still-hypothetical market.“Ishihara was an eloquent speaker but there was no political consensus behind his words,” he says. By the time one began to form, Japan had fallen under a series of weak and shortlived governments, none of which was willing to take on the socially contentious issue.Conditions are different now. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, is the most powerful Japanese leader in close to a decade and is keen to add tangible examples of economic liberalisation to his “Abenomics” growth programme. He is listed as a senior adviser to the cross-party group of lawmakers behind the casino bill, and last year he told parliament that he saw “significant merit” in legalisation.Also contributing to the shift have been Japan’s worsening government debt, the China-fuelled profitability of casinos in Macau – the world’s biggest gambling market– and Singapore, and a fresh emphasis on promoting tourism. Many believe Tokyo’s selection last year as host of the 2020 Olympics added fresh impetus.How fast will casinos actually spread in Japan, and how much of the business will go to foreigners? There are reasons for caution on both fronts. Some 20 municipalities are gearing up to lobby for casinos but most people close to the debate believe that a maximum of three will be licensed at first.It will take a number of years to draft regulations, choose investors and build – a tightening market for construction materials and labour in the lead-up to the Olympics would make any 2020 opening “difficult, though not impossible”, Mr Kiso believes.Then, if and when they proved their worth over several more years – generating big tax revenues without noticeably contributing to crime or addiction – the government would consider issuing a new round of licences.At the CLSA conference, the dauntless Mr Adelson argued that Sands should be allowed to set up a casino on its own, given its stature as the world’s most valuable gambling company and Japanese groups’ inevitable lack of experience.Mr Kiso calls that attitude “naive”.“In this country, it simply doesn’t happen that foreigners come in and do big projects completely on their own,” he says. Joint ventures are likely the only route in.A number of Japanese groups are positioning themselves as local champions. Fuji Media Holdings, a television and publishing group, has allied with the property developer Mitsui Fudosan and Kajima, a big construction company, to lobby for a casino in Tokyo’s seaside Odaiba area, not far from the main cluster of Olympic venues.Sega Sammy Holdings, a maker of pachinko machines, is also hoping to expand into casinos. Last year it bought the struggling Seagaia resort on the southern island of Kyushu and partnered with Paradise group, one of South Korea’s largest casino operators, on a planned $1.7bn casino near Seoul in what analysts say is an attempt to gain experience. The company is well connected: Mr Abe and two former prime ministers attended the wedding of its chief executive’s daughter in September.Whoever gets the business, it will be good for the Japan Casino School and its students. “This has been debated for more than 10 years,” says Masayoshi Oiwane, its principal. “There will never be another chance like this.”
39;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2014-02-14T12:24:07Z;Record profits for Sheldon Adelson’s Sands China amid hacking probe;;Sands China, the casino operator run by Sheldon Adelson, has unveiled record revenues and profits for 2013, as the US Federal Bureau of Investigation probes a hacking attack that crippled the group’s global website.Chinese gamblers’ insatiable appetite for playing baccarat in Macau – the only place in China where casinos are legal – helped propel profits up 79 per cent to $2.2bn.“Our properties continue to generate market-leading visitation,” said Mr Adelson, the US gambling tycoon who is chairman of both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China. “In 2013 we welcomed nearly 63m visitors to our properties, including over 6m in the month of December alone.”Those gamblers and shoppers at the brand stores that fill the flagship Venetian hotel and casino helped push net revenues up 37 per cent to $8.9bn – more than the total revenue made by the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip – while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation grew 47 per cent to $2.9bn.But the record results came as Sands scrambled to bring its website back online four days after it was hacked in an attack that resulted in the social security numbers of some employees being posted online. Visitors to the Sands China website on Friday afternoon were greeted with the message: “The website is undergoing maintenance.”“The company continues to assist local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in the investigation into the hacking activity,” Sands said on Friday.Sands China’s record results came a day after Melco Crown, the Macau casino operator run by Australia’s James Packer and Lawrence Ho, the son of gaming tycoon Stanley Ho, posted stronger ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2013 on the back of stronger growth in the mass market.Casinos in Macau thrive on high-rolling VIP gamblers – who bet in special rooms off the main gaming areas – and increasingly on the more lucrative mass market. The latter is being powered by the rapid growth in the number of mainland Chinese travelling to the former Portuguese colony to bet, shop and attend shows and concerts by everyone from Justin Bieber to the Rolling Stones, who will perform next month.Gambling revenues in Macau rose to $45bn last year. The Chinese territory is expected to continue to benefit from the industry as more and more Chinese have the money to travel to the enclave, just off the southern province of Guangdong.CLSA, the brokerage, estimates that revenues will grow to $77bn by 2017, helped partly by the expanding transport links in south China that are bringing more people within easy travelling distance to Macau.Sands China and other casinos are also expanding on the Cotai Strip, the newest development in the gambling haven, and diversifying into other forms of entertainment to satisfy the Macau government and Beijing.Mr Adelson said his company’s increasingly diversified properties “enhance Macau’s appeal as a business and leisure tourism destination, helping to diversify Macau’s economy and to provide meaningful employment opportunities for the people of Macau”.SJM, the company founded by Stanley Ho – the 92-year-old who held the sole casino licence until 2002 – on Thursday broke ground on a site that will become the “Lisboa Palace”, at a price tag of just under $4bn.Twitter: @AsiaNewsDemetri
40;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2014-02-11T11:10:07Z;Casino owners battle over online gambling;;A debate over the future of internet gambling has created a rift among US casino industry titans, pitting advocates of expansion such as Jim Murran, chief executive of MGM Resorts, against billionaire opponents Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn.The split, which erupted in an advertising battle this week, comes at a pivotal moment for the industry, following last year’s launch of online gambling in Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada. As many as 10 states – including California, Illinois and Pennsylvania – may consider similar legislation in 2014, according to the research firm Gambling Compliance.The push for expansion is coming from a new coalition led by the American Gaming Association, whose members include casino groups such as MGM and Caesars that are eager to develop the online market further.The AGA has launched an ad campaign to push back against Mr Adelson and Mr Wynn – who chair Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, respectively – and promote what it claims are the benefits of legal and regulated internet gaming.“Internet gaming is here,” said Geoff Freeman, AGA president. The choice for the industry was either to get involved or be pushed aside, he added.The prize is a US online gaming market that, if legalised and regulated, could be worth as much as $13.4bn within five years, according to H2 Gambling Capital, an industry research firm.But Mr Adelson, one of the Republican party’s largest donors, has vowed to spend “whatever it takes” to stop internet gambling.Richard McGowan, a Boston College professor who studies the industry, says Mr Adelson’s opposition is rooted in a fear that internet gambling will harm his casinos in Nevada and Pennsylvania. The billionaire argues, however, that the social costs outweigh the revenues.Mr Wynn had remained publicly agnostic until siding with Mr Adelson last week. Mr Adelson has assembled other high-profile figures such as former New York Governor George Pataki and former Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln, to push his message at the state and federal levels.The group launched a six-figure ad campaign on Monday urging Congress to restore the Wire Act of 1961 – which prohibited internet gambling until a 2011 Department of Justice ruling overturned the federal blanket ban and allowed states to decide for themselves.Internet gaming is here. The choice for the industry is either to get involved or be pushed aside“The main thing is to raise public awareness that this is happening. Ninety-five per cent of people have no idea that three states have authorised [internet gambling]. If they did, they would be very frightened by the prospect,” Mr Pataki said.Mr Adelson’s group has corralled support from 16 state attorneys-general opposed to online gambling expansion. It is circulating FBI memos warning that internet casinos can be used by terrorists and criminal syndicates to launder money.Before the late 1980s, most forms of gambling had been prohibited in the US outside Nevada and New Jersey. But the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 changed that by allowing Indian tribes to operate casinos on reservations for their own benefit.Cash-strapped states subsequently authorised slot parlours and small casinos, and by the late 2000s, states were fiercely competing for gambling revenues by building larger and more elaborate casinos. In 2014, 22 states will operate commercial or racetrack casinos, while 28 states host tribal casinos.The AGA had previously been split on the question of internet gambling – primarily due to Las Vegas Sands’ presence on its board. But under Mr Freeman, who took over the group in mid-2013, it now contends that online play is the next logical outgrowth of the industry’s development.Pointing to the fact that Americans are already gambling online through offshore sites to the tune of $3bn a year, the AGA is advocating for federal legalisation and regulation to protect consumers and recapture lost revenues. It says Europe is an example of how online gambling can be regulated and operated safely.The AGA has retained its own team of heavy-hitters including political strategist Jim Messina, who helped mastermind President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election and is a part-time elections adviser to David Cameron’s Conservative party. Known for his use of data and social media-driven messaging, Mr Messina could be influential in winning over voters and legislators.Other states’ appetite to consider online gambling legislation may depend on the experience of recent converts. New Jersey reaped a meagre $8.4m in online gambling revenue after launching in late 2013.The figure was much worse than Governor Chris Christie and most analysts had expected, and industry observers and advocates will be keen to see if a parallel market of online gamers emerges or if the games cannibalise bricks-and-mortar casinos’ revenues.While Europe’s online and traditional casino markets have managed to coexist, the abundance of casinos in the US compared with Europe means that there are few international precedents to help predict who will win the high-stakes battle for the industry’s future.

Cognizant shares fell 4.29 per cent to $92.85.News that one of America’s largest pharmacy and convenience chains will stop selling cigarettes pressured shares of Lorillard and Altria.Shares in cigarette manufacturer Lorillard slid 2.33 per cent to $47.76 as Altria dropped 1.25 per cent to $34. CVS Caremark announced on Wednesday it would drop tobacco products from its shelves as it tries to recast its relationship with health-conscious consumers.The decision, which is expected to cut some $2bn in annual sales from the drugstore chain, won applause from President Barack Obama. CVS said it would try to recoup some of its lost revenues in other ways. CVS shares fell 1 per cent to $65.44.Estée Lauder shares were among the worst performing on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said profits slid 3 per cent in the fourth quarter to $432.5m, or $1.09 per share.Management said they anticipated fiscal third-quarter profits to range between 52 and 55 cents a share, below Wall Street forecasts, as it sees “a slowing of the near-term growth trend in China and Hong Kong”. Sales in Asia-Pacific dipped 6 per cent in the three months to December.The company logged better results in Europe and the US. Sales in the UK rose at an almost double-digit rate, while those in the Americas, where the US accounts for the bulk of revenue, rose 5 per cent to $1.19bn.Estée Lauder shares fell 5.5 per cent to $65.36 in New York trading.Overall, US equity markets broadly declined before paring their losses, following weaker-than-anticipated job growth in January. ADP, the payroll processor, said the workforce expanded by 175,000 people in the month, led by small and medium-sized business growth.A separate survey of the US service sector showed some improvement in January later in the day, with rising new orders and employment levels.The S&P 500 declined 0.2 per cent to 1,751.64 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged down to 15,440.23. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite slid as much as 1.6 per cent, touching its lowest level since last November, before recovering to 4,011.55.
42;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2014-01-10T15:43:11Z;Malaysia’s Genting set for US casinos gamble;;For at least two years the mighty Las Vegas gambling strip has waited for signs that its dominance of the US casino business might be coming under threat from the other side of the world – Asia.Operators such as Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands have meanwhile struck out east. It has expanded in Asia’s biggest market of Macau and built one of the two biggest casinos in Singapore.But developments this week in three US states provided the clearest sign yet that one of Asia’s biggest casino operators, Malaysia’s Genting group, may finally be getting into position to turn the tables on its rivals.Genting was founded in 1965 by Malaysia’s Lim family with a single hotel and casino in Genting Highlands, a lush hill resort on Peninsular Malaysia.Genting also has gambling interests in Britain, and operates one of two casinos in Singapore, Asia’s second-largest market by revenue after Macau. The Singapore casino – which competes with one operated by Las Vegas Sands – contributes 40 per cent of Genting group earnings before interest and tax, according to Fitch.Singapore “catapulted them into the limelight as it showed them competing against Las Vegas Sands – a powerful global operator. They have become a lot more relevant globally,” says Gary Pinge, regional head of Asian gaming at Macquarie.Almost a year ago, Genting, whose sole US casino business hitherto had been a casino opened in New York in 2011, strode into the Las Vegas Strip by buying an 87-acre site there from Boyd Gaming.The aim is to develop the site into a 3,500-room property with 175,000ft of gaming space right in the heart of the US gaming business.This week Genting fired its latest US salvo, after its 47-per-cent-owned unit, Genting Malaysia, said it had teamed up with three horseracing associations in Miami “with respect to a potential casino”.The same day, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York state laid out a timetable for attracting the state’s first casinos, with tenders going out in March and bids chosen by the autumn. Genting has been taking a keen interest, eager to expand there too.Finally, in Massachusetts, Genting received encouraging news the previous week for its involvement in what would be that state’s first casino. The Bureau of Indian Affairs approved a plan for a $500m gaming facility operated by the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, which is pushing the project in partnership with Genting.Given that . . . legislators have twice rejected ‘destination resorts’ proposals that would allow the creation of at least two sizeable casino resorts, the regulatory approval remains the key hurdleYet the Malaysian group still faces hurdles. Florida is a complex prospect because only one operator is allowed to run a casino under a longstanding exclusivity arrangement with the state government.Lawmakers are due to consider this year whether to end that arrangement, providing an opening for Genting’s first casino in Miami – a far from certain prospect.“Given that . . . legislators have twice rejected ‘destination resorts’ proposals that would allow the creation of at least two sizeable casino resorts, the regulatory approval remains the key hurdle,” said Kenanga Research in Kuala Lumpur.There are also painful memories of Genting’s first foray into Miami in 2011, when it announced the development of a $3.8bn resort on 30 acres of land downtown.While the Resorts World Omni hotel that was to form the core of that resort still exists, the wider project never materialised, partly due to opposition from rival existing hotel businesses, analysts say.The new Miami project would allow Genting to operate a 2,000-slot-machine parlour and off-track betting site downtown. Macquarie’s Mr Pinge said this would still allow the company to get a foothold in the market from which it could expand.While gaming revenues in Asia are expected to grow by almost a fifth each year to 2015, according to PwC, against 5 per cent growth in the US, he argued that a US push made sense as long as rates of return were above Genting’s cost of capital.“This year stands to be a very exciting year for them because a number of things might come good. In two or three years’ time people are going to realise these guys are formidable competitors,” Mr Pinge said.
43;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2013-12-13T17:49:17Z;Sheldon Adelson cancels $30bn Eurovegas project in Spain;;Sheldon Adelson, the US casino mogul, has dropped plans to build a $30bn gambling complex outside Madrid, cancelling one of the largest investment projects in Spain in recent years but also one that attracted public opposition and bitter political controversy from the outset.The so-called Eurovegas project was designed to be the first Las Vegas-style gambling, hotel and conference centre complex on European soil, boasting an avenue of skyscrapers housing 12 resorts, six casinos and 18,000 gaming machines. According to Las Vegas Sands, Mr Adelson’s group, the complex could have created up to 260,000 jobs.The decision to abandon the investment was announced in a statement issued by Las Vegas Sands on Friday. “We do not see a path that would allow us to reach necessary criteria to move forward this grand-scale development. As a result, we will not pursue this opportunity,” Mr Adelson said.The move comes as a blow to the region of Madrid, which had offered strong support to the mega-resort and had cherished hopes that the project would help alleviate the unemployment crisis and bolster sagging tax revenues. At the height of Spain’s recession and banking crisis, the proposed complex also stood out as a rare symbol of economic hope for both capital and country.But critics were quick to highlight that Mr Adelson was seeking to extract a range of politically difficult concessions from the Spanish authorities, including an exemption from the nationwide smoking ban and tax breaks.The Spanish government made clear on Friday that it had rejected the bulk of Mr Adelson’s demands in recent meetings with the US group – a position that is likely to have played a critical role in the scrapping of the project. Speaking after the weekly cabinet meeting, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, the deputy prime minister, said the conditions demanded by the gambling group “could not have been accepted by any of the authorities involved”.She highlighted in particular Mr Adelson’s demand that the government offer a guarantee not to change legislation relevant for the casino in the coming years, or to pay compensation in case of a change.“It is impossible to create a legal shield against regulatory changes because the courts are sovereign, majorities can change and the idea of indemnifying against future regulatory changes does not exist in our legal system,” she said.The group itself made no direct reference to Madrid’s stance, saying only that the government should be “commended” for its continuous work on the project.Mr Adelson added: “The development of an integrated resort in Europe has long been a personal idea of mine but there is a time and a place for everything, and right now our attention is centred on countries in Asia, such as Japan and Korea.”The Eurovegas project had also come under fire from Spain’s Catholic church, which warned that the building of massive gambling complex would damage the social fabric of nearby communities. “The church supports initiatives that are designed to create wealth and employment – but not at any price,” the Bishop of Getafe, a suburb of Madrid close to the proposed site, said in a statement earlier this year.
44;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2013-09-19T12:24:02Z;Caesars bets on online gambling market;;At 9.19am Pacific Daylight Time on Thursday, somewhere in Nevada, a resident or visitor to the state logged on to a computer or a tablet to play World Series of Poker online for the first time for real money.For Caesars, the operator of the WSOP brand – which in the land-based world of gambling has been an annual Las Vegas tournament since 1970 – the money to be made from this particular player and others in the months following the launch is of trifling concern.Of more relevance is the symbolism of the moment. Caesars has become the first large Las Vegas casino operator to take a dime out of online gambling.Outlawed by Congress seven years ago, online gambling is finally gaining a legal foothold in the US, albeit in limited form. State by state, legislators are passing regulations allowing for online poker, casino and bingo. Sports betting remains off the table.Nevada has led the way, followed by Delaware, though their small populations make it tough for online operators to make money. But New Jersey is set to go online in the next few months, and New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and California are actively planning for regulation.The US online gambling market could be worth $7.4bn in gross winnings by 2017, according to consultants H2 Gaming Capital, on the assumption that 17 states will have regulated online gambling.It is not just the politicians who have been slow to come round to its acceptance, and only then because of the tax revenue benefits.Some of the big casino moguls have proved ambivalent at best, hostile at worst, regarding online gambling as an errant, untrustworthy offspring that would damage the revenues of their casino palaces.To Sheldon Adelson, online gambling represents nothing less than a threat to society – “a toxin which all good people ought to resist” – as the chief executive of Las Vegas Sands wrote in Forbes magazine in June.Steve Wynn, in a hurry to expand his mega-casino Wynn Resorts empire across North America and Macau, has an ambivalent attitude to online gambling.It’s going to look like a tsunami in a bath tub“I don’t know how to make the experience on a computer screen 17 inches in diameter particularly unforgettable,” he said on a typically colourful analysts’ call in April. He quickly added that his company would some day have to find the formula.But Caesars, under chief executive Gary Loveman, is throwing itself at the task, and Nevada’s 2.8m population is about to bombarded with a publicity onslaught.“It’s going to look like a tsunami in a bath tub,” said Mitch Garber, the former chief executive of PartyGaming recruited by Mr Loveman six years ago to set up and run the group’s online strategy.A potentially bigger market is the 39m visitors who descend on Las Vegas each year. Airport advertising, billboards on the Strip, wraparound posters at Caesars’ hotels, hotel room keys and Do Not Disturb signs will all aim to persuade visitors about the attractions of WSOP online.Another day, another refinancing at private equity-owned Caesars Entertainment. In this case the Las Vegas-based casino operator said this week it was seeking to raise almost $5bn in bonds and loans to refinance its commercial mortgage-backed securities and a chunk of junior debt.continue readingTheir online gambling experience may only be limited to the length of their Vegas holiday, but lobbyists for online gambling think this will still be worthwhile.“It will get more Americans exposed to playing online and maybe they will put pressure on their own state legislators,” said John Pappas of the Poker Players’ Alliance.The launch of WSOP online is a moment to savour, too, for the European industry. Congress’s decisive ban in 2006 led to the exodus of European operators from the US, among them London-listed 888 Holdings.Now, 888, founded by the Israeli brothers Avi and Aaron Shaken, is back in the US. 888 technology is powering the WSOP website for Caesars, which like other US land-based casino groups lacks the back-end online gambling knowhow developed by the Europeans.“This is a magic moment for 888,” said chief executive Brian Mattingley. “We have a control room in Tel Aviv where people are watching the first deposits from the US coming in live.”It will get more Americans exposed to playing online and maybe they will put pressure on their own state legislatorsThose deposits are unlikely to be significant to 888’s revenues until 2015. By then, the industry may have a better idea whether Mr Adelson’s suspicions about online gambling cannibalising the land-based operators are well founded.Mr Garber recalls the pre-2006 days when online specialists such as PartyGaming and 888 were enriched by the popularity of internet poker among Americans.“We know Americans want to play poker online,” he said. “For us, this is a laboratory for others to watch and hopefully learn from it and follow it. Most of our competitors see online as a competitive part of the future and will be rooting for our success.”
45;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2013-05-31T17:50:04Z;Shortcuts: Travel news and inspiration;A ‘EuroVegas’ resort on the outskirts of Madrid, tented camps in southern Colorado and a ‘world-class’ ski area in North Korea;Spain Sheldon Adelson, billionaire chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, last week announced more details of the vast “EuroVegas” resort due to be built on the outskirts of Madrid. Speaking at the Jerusalem International Tourism Summit, he said it would have 12 hotels, each with about 3,000 rooms, and a total of 2,400 meeting rooms, which could make it “the convention centre of the world”. Adelson, who is credited with reducing Las Vegas’s reliance on casinos by growing the conventions and events business, said he would stick to the same formula for Madrid and other future projects. The first phase is due for completion in 2017.www.sands.com…US In the mountains of southern Colorado, tented camps used to provide basic accommodation for prospectors and migrant workers but now the concept has been reinvented for affluent, style-conscious, tourists. Cresto Ranch, which opens this weekend, consists of eight tents for two (rentable at $1,400 per night) on the banks of the Dolores river between Telluride and Cortez. Activities include fly-fishing for trout, as well as riding, hiking and rafting, and there is a restaurant and bar in a restored, riverside farmhouse. The property, owned by London-based financier Christoph Henkel, is a sister to Dunton Hot Springs, a renovated ghost town four miles upriver.www.duntonhotsprings.com…Switzerland The Swiss National Tourist Office has launched an innovative scheme that rates hotels on “friendliness” rather than facilities, cleanliness or cuisine. Rather than employ official inspectors, the project, undertaken with partners including the Lausanne Hospitality Management School and University of Bern, uses software that automatically analyses reviews posted on more than 250 websites. The 100 “friendliest” hotels, announced at a ceremony in Bern last week, can display Prix Bienvenu logos in their marketing material, alongside traditional star ratings. It will now become an annual process.www.myswitzerland.com…North Korea The country’s leader Kim Jong-eun last week inspected work on what he said would be a “world-class” ski resort. The ski area, at Masik Hill in Kangwon province, will eventually have 110km of pistes, as well as cable cars, a heliport and a hotel, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. The construction of the resort comes as South Korea prepares to host the 2018 winter Olympics. Kim, who studied in Switzerland, said it would be “more fantastic to see the ground covered with snow”.
46;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2013-03-15T14:15:43Z;Philippines bids for Asia gaming crown;;The Philippines has taken bold new steps towards challenging Macau for the crown of being Asia’s gaming hub with the opening of the island nation’s first integrated casino resort.The Solaire Manila, a $1bn investment built on a strip of reclaimed land along Manila Bay, will throw open its doors in a grand opening on Saturday. Melco Crown Entertainment, the Macau gaming firm, on Friday signed an agreement with Philippine property developer Belle Corp to invest $600m in a casino resort scheduled to open in March next year.In total, four such large gaming developments are expected to launch over the next four years. At present, the Philippines’ only casino is Genting’s Resorts World Manila, which opened in 2009 and is located near Manila airport.“We think the Philippines is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting countries around,” Lawrence Ho, co-chairman and chief executive of Melco Crown, said. He expects the Philippines’ gaming industry to be the size of Las Vegas or Singapore, at about $6bn, in the next five to six years.The Philippines’ push, however, comes as business is hitting ever new highs in Macau, with the casinos there increasingly tapping into China’s mass-market gamblers rather than its more mobile VIP clients.It will also have to compete with Singapore, where Malaysia’s Genting Group and rival Las Vegas Sands both operate multibillion-dollar gaming projects. Their two casinos generated gaming revenues of $5.9bn in 2011, according to Citibank, just behind the $6.1bn earned by casinos in Las Vegas, though both suffered a fall in revenues last year after the Singapore government widened a ban on low-income citizens using the casinosStill, analysts expect the Philippines to be an attractive new destination for the junket operators that manage where the majority of Asia’s VIP gamblers go to play.“We expect strong participation from junkets, owing to hefty fees and a supportive regulatory environment,” said Credit Suisse analysts. “We expect a strong and lasting novelty effect in the early years, as no new casinos have opened in the Philippines since 2009.”The Solaire Manila, owned by the Filipino billionaire Enrique Razon through publicly listed Bloomberry Resorts, is designed as “two casinos in one”, according to the company. The spacious ground floor caters mainly to locals, with restaurants, a food court and entertainment areas. The second level, meanwhile, is designed for foreign high rollers and has private gaming salons with their own comfort rooms and views across Manila BayCristino Naguiat, chairman of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, the government agency that regulates casinos, said he expected Bloomberry to gross 1.5bn pesos ($37m) on its first day of operations.
47;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2013-03-05T10:09:09Z;Asia v Vegas: Genting’s gamble;With Asia’s potential, why is Genting bothering with Vegas?;"If George Clooney and Brad Pitt were tempted to extend the Ocean’s Trilogy to Fourteen, the gambling element would have to be set in Macau, or at least Asia, to be credible. Macau’s gaming revenues are more than six times those of Las Vegas; casino operators can make four times per asset dollar in Macau what they do in Vegas; and even Singapore, with two casinos, is challenging Vegas for second place in world rankings. With that in mind, why on earth is Genting, with all this on its doorstep, bothering with a Vegas development?Genting is the quietest big name in global gaming. Through its Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysian subsidiaries it has casino interests from New York State to Birmingham in the UK, and Manila to Malaysia via Sydney and Singapore. Combined, Genting’s companies have net cash of $2.3bn, just behind Macau giant SJM Holdings. That explains Genting’s interest in dealmaking, but not its choice of location. Gaming revenues in Asia are expected to grow by almost a fifth a year to 2015, according to PwC, against 5 per cent growth in the US. Perhaps US casinos are more profitable? But they are not. Take Las Vegas Sands, the biggest by market capitalisation. It makes about 25 per cent operating margins on its Vegas Venetian casino, but margins of a third on the Macau namesake. Its Marina Bay Sands (the Singapore casino competing with Genting’s Resorts World), has a margin of more than two-fifths. In terms of returns, then, Vegas is not the best destination.Perhaps Genting’s interest is as simple as public perception: Sin City still has a cachet that Asia cannot yet match. Genting cannot get a licence in Macau for now, so operating in Vegas would be a badge of honour. Yet those sorts of badges usually come with high costs, but profits that are harder to quantify.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
48;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2013-03-03T19:04:00Z;Las Vegas Sands admits possible law breach;;Las Vegas Sands, the casino group controlled by billionaire Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, has admitted in a regulatory filing that it might have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars US companies from paying bribes to foreign companies.The company, which is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice, is based in Las Vegas but makes most of its money in Macau.It said in a filing that an internal audit committee had found that “there were likely violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA”.The findings could help US authorities’ probe into Sands’ depending on the severity of the “likely’ violations. A a person familiar with the US inquiry said no resolution of the investigation is imminent.However, the revelation is unlikely to affect Mr Adelson’s role as a leading Republican donor. He and his wife spent more than $100m in political donations, mostly to Republican-supporting super political action committees in the 2012 election.One leading Republican fundraiser told the Financial Times the admission would have “no impact” because there were no “credible reasons” to believe the allegations personally reflected on Mr Adelson.“For recipients of money any bad publicity is outweighed by the value of the resources provided,” the person added, comparing Mr Adelson’s donations to groups that supported Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich to Bill Maher’s contributions to Priorities USA, which supported Barack Obama.Las Vegas Sands said in the filing that it was “currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter, the extent of materiality, or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any”.The company is embroiled in a legal dispute with Steven Jacobs, a former chief executive of its Macau subsidiary. Mr Jacobs has alleged breach of contract and claimed he was ordered to withhold certain sensitive information from the board of Las Vegas Sands. LVS denies these allegations but said in its filing that its subpoena from the SEC “may have emanated” from Mr Jacobs’ lawsuit.LVS competes with US operators such as Wynn Resorts in Macau, as well as local casino groups. They are vying for a piece of the lucrative gaming market, fuelled by visitors from mainland China, which has grown rapidly and now generates annual receipts of $38bn.
49;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2013-01-31T05:37:08Z;Sands China net profit jumps 52%;;Sands China, the Macau casino operator owned by US billionaire Sheldon Adelson, saw a 52 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net profit as it benefited from an increase in visitors to its newest property in the territory.The division of Las Vegas Sands said its quarterly net profit was $467m, compared with $307m a year ago. Its revenues rose 48 per cent to $1.97bn year-on-year and 20 per cent quarter-on-quarter.Sands China opened a resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau last April, which attracted 3m visitors in the quarter. This week it opened a tower at its Sheraton property on Cotai and confirmed it had received permission from the Macau government for 200 additional gaming tables.Its results are a signal that Asian casino revenues are rebounding as the Chinese economy improves. Macau casino revenues in December rose 20 per cent to 28.2bn patacas ($3.5bn).Buoyed by Sands China’s results, shares in casino operator Genting Singapore rose 7.5 per cent on Thursday to their highest price in more than six months.Aaron Fischer, an analyst with brokerage CLSA, said Sands China was his “top medium-term pick” because of its wide array of hotels and casinos in the territory and because it could boast better near-term earnings growth as its new property Sands Cotai Central expanded. Mr Fischer said the company’s ebitda of US$620m was 9 per cent above CLSA’s estimate.The number of gaming tables in the tightly regulated market is expected to increase by 3 per cent annually over the next few years. CLSA estimates that the additional gaming tables at Sands China will deliver $200m in ebitda when they are fully deployed across the company’s casinos in Macau, which include the Venetian, Sands Cotai Central and Sands Macau.Sands China has also benefited because it is targeting the mass market, which is seen as a more stable growth driver for the industry. It is planning to invest $2.8bn to build a fifth resort in Macau called the Parisian, with a replica of the Eiffel Tower and 3,000 hotel rooms aimed at the mid-market.“We think Sands China will have the strongest earnings growth momentum among all six operators in Macau in the coming year and that will continue to provide valuation support for the company,” said Nomura in a note to clients.Las Vegas Sands, Sands China’s parent, reported full-year results in the US on Wednesday. Revenues increased 18 per cent to $11.1bn, while adjusted net income was $1.77bn.
50;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2013-01-07T09:54:55Z;Singapore casinos slow after opening buzz;;To the uninitiated, a room in one of the “Ocean Suites” at Resorts World Sentosa looks and feels like any other hotel room.But at the flick of a switch, a window blind rolls back to reveal a floor-to-ceiling glass panel of an aquarium filled with manta rays and dozens of species of fish swimming past at eye-level.At S$2,400 (US$1,967) a night, the rooms, which opened for booking last month , are an extravagant finishing touch to a combined casino and leisure park that has been opening in phases on Singapore’s Sentosa island since 2010.That was when Resorts World’s owner, Malaysia’s Genting Group, and rival Las Vegas Sands, headed by US casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, kicked off multibillion-dollar projects designed to capitalise on Singapore’s move to legalise gambling in its attempt to become an Asian tourist mecca.But Singapore – Asia’s second-biggest gambling hub by revenues, behind Macau – now faces a slowdown as a weaker Chinese economy and tighter restrictions on the number of Singaporeans allowed to gamble take their toll.In the third quarter, both Mr Adelson’s Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World saw their gaming revenues fall the most in about 18 months, down 28 per cent and 20 per cent respectively year on year.Singapore’s two casinos generated gaming revenues of US$5.9bn in 2011, according to Citibank, just behind the $6.1bn earned by casinos in Las Vegas, the US gambling capital.But last year George Choi, a Citi analyst, predicts that Singapore’s revenues will have fallen back to $5.4bn.“They almost matched what Vegas did last year and that was a very big achievement for Singapore. The problem is we hit the peak last year and it’s reached a plateau,” he said.One reason for the fall has been a widening in June of a ban by the Singapore government on low-income citizens from using the casinos, amid concerns over the social side-effects of gambling addiction. Singaporeans, unlike foreigners, already have to pay an entry fee of S$100 just to walk through the casino turnstiles.Despite the slowdown, Singapore’s decision to embrace gaming after years of opposition on the grounds of perceived links between gambling and crime appears to have paid off, giving a lift to the domestic economy just when it has started to need it most.Economically, it’s been a great success. Socially, the impact has been about what we expected it to be. I think we did the right thing“Economically, it’s been a great success,” Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, told Bloomberg. “Socially, the impact has been about what we expected it to be. I think we did the right thing.”An official task force estimated in 2005 that casinos combined with theme parks and convention facilities would add 35,000 jobs and 1.5 percentage points to gross domestic product.The government recently estimated that casinos contribute 1.5-2 per cent of GDP and employ 22,400 people at the two resorts, with thousands more employed in ancillary services.That was a modest factor in helping Singapore narrowly escape a technical recession in the fourth quarter .Gambling has also generated new revenues through taxes levied on gaming, amounting to 2.2 per cent of total government operating revenue. Casinos have boosted tourism, with arrivals growing 8 per cent in the second quarter to almost 3.5m – a figure equivalent to two-thirds of Singapore’s population. That generated about S$5.5bn in revenues, a rise of 4 per cent on a year before.Wai Ho Leong, senior regional economist at Barclays, and a former member of the task force, says: “Casinos have played a pivotal role in changing the Singapore experience for visitors. We are no longer losing out on our regional share of tourism.”Resorts World is betting that new attractions such as its Ocean Suites aquarium hotel rooms – on top of Asia’s only Universal Studios theme park – will help reverse the downturn by attracting more tourists and thus casino players.Lim Kok Thay, chairman of Genting, says the “novelty effect” of gaming for local Singaporean gamblers has started to wear off but that “as we open more and more of our facilities that will definitely give us an edge as we market overseas . . . [and] will help on the gaming front”.However, analysts say it is hard to predict the extent to which visitors to non-gaming attractions will also use a casino.The prospects for Singapore’s casino industry are also clouded by the emergence of competition from elsewhere in the region and tighter restrictions looming on the use of so-called junkets – gambling tours organised by independent operators that help bring business to casinos.Fitch, the rating agency, says planned changes to the law governing Singapore’s gambling industry that would cap commissions paid to junket operators by casinos could crimp the “VIP” business that accounts for up to half of Singapore casinos’ revenues.Singapore’s initial success with casinos has prompted Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines to consider setting up or expanding existing casinos, putting more pressure on the city state to keep attracting high-rollers from the region.“The junket operators will be more reluctant to take VIPs to Singapore because they will get better returns elsewhere,” says Vicky Melbourne, head of industrials at Fitch. “Once Singapore opened up [to casinos] there was a lot more activity and interest in the region. That’s only going to increase.”This article has been amended since original publication
51;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-11-08T06:22:58Z;Permira completes Macau withdrawal;;Permira has completed its exit from Macau’s casino industry with the sale of its remaining holding in Galaxy Entertainment Group, which comes as corporate results confirm a sharp slowdown in the world’s largest gaming market by revenue.The UK private equity firm was among the first investment groups to place a big wager on the Chinese city’s gaming scene when it paid HK$6.5bn (US$830m) for a 20 per cent stake in Galaxy in 2007, the first year Macau’s annual casino revenues matched those of the Las Vegas Strip.By selling its last 5.94 per cent stake for US$875m, Permira is estimated by Reuters to have made a total profit of US$1.4bn on its original investment since it began selling down its Galaxy holdings in September 2011.Casinos in Macau, a special administrative region controlled by Beijing, are highly dependent on visitors from mainland China who contribute around two-thirds of the city’s gaming proceeds. With the Chinese economy growing at its slowest rate for three years, casinos reported either slowing growth or actual declines in third-quarter profits. The impact has been especially felt in the so-called VIP segment – high-rollers who have bankrolled much of Macau’s phenomenal growth since the government liberalised the gaming market in 2004.Melco Crown Entertainment, a joint venture between Australian billionaire James Packer and Lawrence Ho, son of Macau casino mogul Stanley Ho, on Wednesday reported a 7.4 per cent fall in net profit to $104.9m while revenue slipped 4 per cent from a year ago.MGM China, a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Lawrence Ho’s sister Pansy, last week said revenue rose 6.1 per cent and net profit increased 8.9 per cent in the third quarter. In the same quarter last year, net profit surged 130 per cent.Sands China, the Macau subsidiary of Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, has weathered the slowdown better than most rivals because of its focus on mass market gamblers and the opening of a new property. LVS said last week that Sands China’s quarterly net profit grew 17 per cent to $327m while revenue rose 37 per cent to $1.6bn.Permira sold the latest stake before the end of the 90-day lock-up after its last sale in August in part because it received Galaxy’s consent, said Damien Brosnan of UBS, the sole underwriter of the deal. A sizeable global asset manager who was already a shareholder in Galaxy expressed interest in buying a large portion of the deal at a 5 per cent discount to Wednesday’s closing price of HK$28.60, he said.The 249.6m shares were sold at HK$27.17 each, at the bottom of the HK$27.17-HK$27.46 range at which they were offered, due to the sell-off in the US equities market overnight, Mr Brosnan said.Galaxy shares were down 3.9 per cent on Thursday afternoon after Permira’s stake sale was announced, but are still some 28 per cent higher than at the start of the year.Despite the recent industry slowdown casino owners remain upbeat about Macau’s prospects, with a number of new resorts expected to fuel more heated competition. MGM China and SJM Holdings both received the go-ahead for new casinos on Macau’s Cotai Strip last month, following announcements by Wynn Macau and Sands China that they were investing billions of dollars in mega-casinos.
52;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-09-20T14:56:34Z;Macau gaming – medium rollers;Shift in focus away from high-spending VIPs implies slower growth;"High-rollers prefer privacy. That makes the fight between gaming tycoons Steve Wynn and Kazuo Okada over a stake in Wynn Resorts, and Sheldon Adelson’s decision to adorn his latest Macau casino with a replica of the Eiffel Tower, all the more entertaining. But it distracts from the bigger question: what has happened to Macau’s high-rollers?Knowing who they are is a start. Only casino owners and the junket operators that bring them in really know. However, a 2010 study of VIP gamblers by the Macau Polytechnic Institute concluded that a quarter are Chinese government officials, almost as many are managers in state-owned enterprises, and a third run private businesses. High-rollers account for more than two-thirds of Macau’s gaming revenues ($39bn expected this year, almost seven times more than Las Vegas). But growth in those revenues has slowed sharply, from 20 per cent annually earlier this year to just 1.5 per cent in July. The growth rate in August was 5.5 per cent. Private businessmen are under cash flow pressure, and Chinese local government finances have felt the effects of a credit squeeze, fewer land sales and rising debts.Macau gaming has until now been about growth as much as profit margins, and the former has been driven by VIPs. Mass-market revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 25 per cent since 2006; revenues from high-rollers have grown half as much again, according to Jefferies. Mr Adelson unveiled a French-themed $2.5bn project in Macau under Sands China on Thursday. Crucially, it is family-friendly. This is good for margins, because regular punters pay for hotels and dinners; VIPs do not. But the shift in focus implies slower growth. Shares in Wynn Macau and Sands China are up a third in eight weeks. That is all very well, just so long as investors are not still gambling on high growth rates.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
53;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-09-20T07:17:21Z;Adelson to bring Eiffel Tower to Macau;;Sands China is planning to invest at least $2.5bn in Macau on a Paris-themed resort featuring a replica Eiffel Tower, as the company continues its aggressive expansion in the territory’s gaming market despite a slowdown in the Chinese economy.Michael Leven, president of Las Vegas Sands which controls the Macau subsidiary, said the new 3,000-room resort known as “The Parisian”, with a 160-metre Eiffel Tower, would be financed with $900m in cash and the balance in bank loans.“I have always believed that this industry is supply-driven,” said Sheldon Adelson, chairman and founder of LVS and major backer of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.The company plans to begin pre-construction work in November on the project, its fifth in the territory, while awaiting final government approval.Mr Adelson was in Macau on Thursday to unveil the second phase of the Sands Cotai Central resort, the group’s fourth, which features a new casino and a Sheraton hotel which will have 4,000 rooms when fully open next year.The 79-year-old is widely accredited with creating the Cotai Strip in Macau, an area of newly reclaimed land that was transformed into a row of large, Las Vegas-style casinos after Macau opened up its gaming industry in 2002.Since the opening of Sands Macau in 2004 – the first foreign-owned casino – the city’s annual gaming revenue has grown exponentially to hit $33.5bn last year, more than five times that of Las Vegas.However, saturation has become a growing concern, given that a number of large projects are opening in the next few years just as year-on-year growth in casino revenue slipped to 5.5 per cent in August.Galaxy Entertainment is spending $2bn on the expansion of its Galaxy Macau resort in Cotai, which is located next to Mr Adelson’s Venetian Macau, the first major resort to open in Cotai in 2007.Steve Wynn, Mr Adelson’s rival in the US, also announced plans for a new $4bn resort in June.Mr Adelson said he was confident that the gaming industry had barely scratched the surface of Chinese demand, saying that only about 2 per cent of China’s population visited Macau, compared with 13 per cent of the US population that visited Las Vegas.LVS, which this month announced it would build a $22bn “EuroVegas” in Madrid, is also eyeing other Asian countries where it could expand its portfolio of casinos beyond Macau and Singapore, where it owns the Marina Bay Sands. Mr Adelson said he was interested in Japan, South Korea and Vietnam.He said that Taiwan, which in July decided to allow casinos on an outlying island, had no appeal unless it allowed casinos to be built in either Taipei or Kaohsiung. Shares in Hong Kong-listed Sands China, which reported a 19 per cent drop in first-half net profit in July, fell 1 per cent on Thursday.
54;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-09-14T18:49:30Z;EuroVegas is a gamble not worth taking;Being chosen as the site for a new mega-casino is a victory no other city should envy;The Madrid regional authority, controlled by the Popular party of the Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, announced this week it had been chosen as the site for a European imitation of Las Vegas, beating Barcelona. Las Vegas Sands, owned by the US billionaire Sheldon Adelson, plans an €18bn complex that would include a dozen resorts, six casinos and 18,000 slot machines. “ EuroVegas”, as it is called, is supposed to generate tax revenues and jobs for Spain, along with profits for Mr Adelson.If this is a victory for Madrid, it is one that no other city should envy. The US model of mogul-managed, state-protected mega-gambling works poorly even in its land of origin. It rests on certain kinds of leverage specific to the US political system, including lobby-dominated campaign financing and legal waivers for American Indian tribes. Without such concessions, it is unlikely to function at all. Madrid has got into a fool’s game, a project likely to incur the wrath of its citizens.US state governments began licensing casinos to raise revenue two or three decades ago, when they lost the courage to raise taxes. Connecticut is one state that has funded itself aggressively through gambling. It has two mega-casinos, including Foxwoods, the largest in the US. The state keeps a quarter of the money that casinos hold after they pay out the winnings. It is an inefficient – and regressive – form of tax farming.Addiction, bankruptcy, crime and suicide ultimately make gambling a very expensive pastime. Connecticut has ignored these externalities. Other states pay for them. The Center for Policy Analysis at the University of Massachusetts estimates Connecticut residents make up only 35.2 per cent of the patrons at Foxwoods. Connecticut thus keeps the entire tax take but must cover only a third of the medical, criminal and social costs it generates. A “race to the bottom” results. The state’s New England and mid-Atlantic neighbours feel they must open gaudy gambling complexes as a matter of fiscal self-defence. Rhode Island and Maine have introduced big-time gambling. Massachusetts plans to do so.Once all states get over their moral scruples and have casinos of their own, the windfall profits of the early movers evaporate. They may even turn into losses. Foxwoods had to restructure more than $2.2bn in debts in August. Much of it came from over-borrowing to overbuild, a result of confidence that Connecticut would continue to be able to collect from eight or 10 states’ worth of gamblers.LVS expects to pay only between a quarter and a third of what it will cost to build EuroVegas. It reportedly wants softening of laws regarding smoking, zoning and unionisation. The project has more in common with 18th-century government charters than with the free market. If the US system is the model, then LVS needs other things, too, which Spain is not in a position to promise: first, a regional monopoly such as Connecticut enjoyed until recently. Second, the ability to dump externalities on neighbour countries. It is unlikely the European Commission would tolerate that.Casino interests tend to prey on cash-strapped governments. No US state is in worse financial straits than Illinois. In August its Democratic governor Pat Quinn vetoed a casino plan, saying: “We’re not going to have loopholes for mobsters in Illinois.” In particular, he wants to ban political contributions from gambling interests. Without such contributions, applications for casinos generally fail.Both US parties hustle for gambling money. Getting a casino bill passed was a priority of the Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick from the time he was elected in 2006 until he finally managed it last year. In Maryland the governor, Martin O’Malley, spends much of his time expanding the state’s gambling programmes. He even convoked a special session of the state assembly in August to pass laws that expanded gambling. Mr Patrick and Mr O’Malley are both Democrats. Frank Fahrenkopf, the American Gaming Association CEO, is a Republican, and Mr Adelson has been an open-handed contributor to Republican presidential campaigns: the former House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich’s in the primary and now Mitt Romney’s in the general election.Madrid’s selling point is that it has hundreds of millions of potential punters within a few hours’ flight. The dictator Francisco Franco was thinking something similar in the 1960s when he used state-backed tourism to defibrillate a dormant Spanish economy. Quick development was one result. A dependence on construction-based bubbles was another. And unlike the Costa del Sol, vice can be sold by anyone, anywhere. When that becomes apparent, Madrid will have done little more than help a cosseted American corporation spread inequality and woe.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard
55;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-09-11T17:50:19Z;Report says Romney backer could save $2bn;;Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate backing Mitt Romney’s campaign for president, could save more than $2bn in taxes over four years of a Republican-controlled White House, according to a new report published on Tuesday.The figures, detailed by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, part of the leftwing think-tank with close ties to the Obama administration, are drawing new attention to the Republican candidate’s links to big business.The conclusions dovetail neatly with the Obama campaign’s narrative that Mr Romney, a multimillionaire former private equity executive, will favour the wealthy over the middle and working classes if he is elected.Mr Romney has been hammering the president over his economic record and especially the stubbornly high unemployment rate, repeatedly asking voters if they are better off now than when President Barack Obama took office.Mr Adelson, the chairman of Las Vegas Sands casino chain, has contributed $36m to Republican-aligned groups but has pledged to spend as much as $100m of his estimated $25bn fortune to help defeat Mr Obama.“That is certainly a lot of money. But it pales in comparison to the windfall that he could receive from tax cuts if Romney is elected,” said Seth Hanlon, the director of fiscal reform at the CAP Action Fund, who wrote the report. “He could turn a $100m investment into a $2bn tax cut.”A spokesperson for Mr Adelson denounced the report as biased.“This estimate was prepared by the American Progress Action Fund, a highly partisan group founded by President Obama’s transition chief and funded by many of Mr Obama’s wealthiest supporters,” he said. “Anyone coming across this propaganda should keep all of that in mind.”Who are the biggest donors to super-Pacs, the organisations that can buy advertising for candidates?The Romney campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the report but the president’s re-election team seized on the conclusions.“Yowza! Adelson bets big on Romney, and under Mitt’s tax scheme, the casino mogul would walk off with a $2 billion pot,” David Axelrod, the Obama campaign’s top strategist, wrote in a tweet.Using public information about Mr Adelson’s income and the profits of Las Vegas Sands, and noting that Mr Romney’s tax plans are vague, Mr Hanlon said as a “reasonable estimate” the mogul would save about $1.5m in taxes on his annual compensation as chief executive of his casino company.Mr Romney has said he wants to extend all the Bush-era tax cuts, while Mr Obama wants the reductions for the top 2 per cent of earners to expire at the end of the year.The Republican has also proposed to cut the corporate tax from 35 to 25 per cent and to maintain taxes on investment income at 15 per cent for the wealthy, in contrast with the president’s plan to raise it to 20 per cent for capital gains and almost 40 per cent for dividends.If Mr Romney maintained the special low rates on dividends, Mr Adelson could save nearly $120m on a single year’s worth of dividends, the CAP report said.Mr Romney’s policies as outlined could also provide Mr Adelson with a tax windfall of about $1.2bn to Las Vegas Sands on untaxed profits from its Asian casinos, as well as a “staggering” $8.9bn windfall to Mr Adelson’s heirs if estate taxes are eliminated, Mr Hanlon wrote.Mr Obama has been emphasising inequality throughout his re-election campaign, partly as a way to take attention away from his poor headline figures on the economy.A new ABC News/Washington Post poll published on Tuesday found that this message might be working.The president now has a 15-point lead when likely voters were asked which candidate they trusted to do a better job advancing the interests of the middle class, with 53 per cent support to Mr Romney’s 38. He also enjoys a new, although slender, lead on dealing with taxes, the poll found.
56;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-07-26T08:14:22Z;Sands China profit falls 40%;;Sands China, the Hong Kong-listed Macau casino operator, suffered a 40 per cent fall in net profit for the second quarter as an impairment charge exacerbated a broader slowdown in the world’s largest gaming market.The owner of the Venetian Macau, the world’s largest casino, on Thursday said results were also affected by a lower rate of money won by the casino from gamblers.Profits took an additional hit from a US$100.8m one-off charge incurred for abandoning construction on two parcels of land in Macau’s Cotai Strip after the government refused to grant final permission for the projects, as well as US$43.5m in pre-opening costs for Cotai Central, the company’s new casino resort scheduled for completion next year.The drop in Asia winnings contributed to lower earnings for parent Las Vegas Sands, which said net profit shrank 34 per cent in the second quarter.Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire chairman of Sands China and Las Vegas Sands, said he remained confident about Macau’s outlook.He said the company had submitted design plans to the Macau government for a new project on a site known as “parcel three” with work slated to begin in November. Sands China is on track to open the second phase of Cotai Central on September 20, he added.Mr Adelson and Las Vegas rival Steve Wynn, chairman of the world’s third-largest gaming company by sales, are continuing to invest heavily in Macau despite a sharp slowdown in gaming revenue growth this year.Wynn Resorts’ subsidiary Wynn Macau last week reported its first drop in quarterly revenue since 2009, hit by slowing Chinese economic growth and rising competition in the Asian gaming hub.Fitch Ratings this week cut its forecast for growth in Macau gaming revenue this year to 10-12 per cent from 15 per cent, citing the impact of the slowdown in mainland China, where most Macau visitors come from.The latest figures show total gaming revenue rose 12 per cent in June from a year ago, well off the pace of 42 per cent growth for 2011 and 58 per cent in 2010.Aaron Fischer, gaming analyst at CLSA, said Sands China would benefit from the extra cashflow coming in from its Cotai Central property, but added he was “grossly disappointed” by the first phase of the $4.4bn resort, which opened in April because of a lack of exciting attractions which could deter visitors.Shares in Sands China were down 4.5 per cent on Thursday afternoon in a nearly flat broader Hong Kong market.
57;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-07-02T13:40:46Z;Macau growth hits the buffers;;The latest data from Macau confirm that the period of exponential growth in the world’s largest gaming market is over, just as two Las Vegas-based casino moguls are investing billions of US dollars into new properties in the Chinese city.In June gaming revenue grew 12.2 per cent from a year ago, official data showed on Monday, which was slower than the 15 per cent growth expected by most analysts. This followed 7 per cent growth in May – the first time revenue grew at a single-digit rate since the global financial crisis – and the 22-35 per cent growth earlier in the year.June’s figure was distorted by a typhoon which made travelling difficult last weekend, but the general trend could fuel rumours that new restrictions had been imposed on mainland visitors, said Grant Govertsen, managing partner of gaming consultancy Union Gaming Research Macau.Last Tuesday Macau gaming stocks listed in Hong Kong fell as much as 6 per cent on a day when the Hang Seng index closed higher, because a local newspaper in Macau reported that new rules meant that mainland Chinese citizens, who made up more than half of total visitors to Macau last year, could visit less frequently.The same paper also claimed that Unionpay, China’s only bank card issuer, had reduced the daily overseas transaction limit. Unionpay did not respond to a request for clarification.The stocks recovered after the Macau government said it had no knowledge of any change in China’s visa restrictions, but the one-day sell-off was a reminder that Macau is at the mercy of Beijing’s favourable policies.In June 2008 China suddenly decided to stop issuing double-entry visas to individual tourists going to Macau. Sands China, the Macau arm of Las Vegas Sands, and Galaxy Entertainment Group, controlled by Hong Kong’s Lui family, had to suspend construction of their new properties until after the visa restrictions were lifted in late 2009 because of a liquidity squeeze.Analysts had predicted a slowdown since last year, largely because of a softer macroeconomic environment in mainland China and the sheer size of Macau’s casino market – which grew 42 per cent in 2011 to reach $34bn, or five times bigger than the Las Vegas Strip.Most analysts said Wynn Macau and Sands China would be able to weather an expected slowdown which could see total gaming revenue grow just 15 per cent this year, and keep building.Wynn Macau recently announced a $4bn casino in Macau’s Cotai strip and Sands China is completing its $4.4bn investment in a partially-opened project called Sands Cotai Central, which would single-handedly raised Macau’s available hotel rooms by 25 per cent when fully opened next year.“Their existing properties are generating enough free cash flow for them to take on more risk, unlike in 2008, when they were just developers,” said Grant Chum, gaming analyst at UBS.Based on estimates by Fitch Ratings, Wynn Macau, which is preparing to issue a $1.5bn senior secured credit facility to help finance its Cotai property, is currently generating annual free cash flow of around $1bn and has excess cash of more than $400m.
58;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-06-29T23:56:33Z;Adelson denies any ‘prostitution strategy’;;Sheldon Adelson, chairman of Las Vegas Sands and a top backer of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, was accused in a lawsuit of approving a “prostitution strategy” at the company’s Macau casino, where the group makes the bulk of its profits.The allegation was one of a litany of accusations by Steve Jacobs, who is suing the casino group for wrongful termination after being fired in 2010.According to a court document filed in Clark County, Nevada this week, Mr Jacobs said in a sworn statement that he had launched an operation to rid the casino floor of “loan sharks and prostitution” after he arrived to run the Macau business in 2009.“Senior [company] executives informed me that the prior prostitution strategy had been personally approved by Adelson,” he said. That strategy had been considered a “success”.The lawsuit, which also alleges that Mr Adelson made illegal demands of Mr Jacobs, has drawn the interest of the Department of Justice, which is investigating the company.The Las Vegas Sands has said all the allegations contained in Mr Jacobs’ suit, including accusations about Mr Adelson, are “baseless”.On the specific allegation regarding prostitution it said: “Mr Adelson has always objected to and maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties, a fact that Mr Jacobs knows to be true, and any accusation to the contrary represents a reprehensible personal attack on Mr Adelson’s character.”The company said it was co-operating with the DoJ and denied any wrongdoing.Neither the Sands nor Mr Adelson have been charged.Women in the sex trade openly scout for business in most casinos in Macau, where prostitution is legal.“Prostitution rings are not known to work with casino management …but there is little to stop the girls from hanging around the properties. They always buy a stack of chips and pose as gamblers so the security staff can’t justify kicking them out,” said a manager of a local nightclub that offers sex services.The latest twist to the original 2010 lawsuit represents a legal headache for Mr Adelson. It is also a piece of unwelcome news for Mr Romney, who met the Sands chairman before Mr Adelson and his wife made a $10m donation to a political committee that backs the Republican candidate.Mr Adelson was the financial backbone of Newt Gingrich’s campaign for the Republican nomination, bankrolling many attacks against Mr Romney for not being conservative enough.Winning over Mr Adelson was a financial coup for Mr Romney’s campaign.The campaign did not respond to requests for comment.In his court filing this week, Mr Jacobs said there were several documents that existed, which he did not possess, that established that Mr Adelson and Sands president Michael Leven controlled the Macau operations from Nevada, where he wants his legal claim to be heard. He is asking that the documents be produced. The Sands wants the trial moved to Macau.Mr Jacobs is also seeking the release of other documents, which he alleged included personal letters from Mr Adelson to the “upper most echelon” of Sands China’s customers, inviting them to his exclusive “Chairman’s Club”.Mr Jacobs said in a sworn court statement that members included known and suspected leaders in Chinese organised crime rings, known as Triads.He also alleged that there was “physically couriering” of funds from Macau to Las Vegas and said the Sands authorised a $16m write-off of Sands China’s books for one unidentified player’s debt and then flew him and his wife to Las Vegas aboard the company’s Boeing 747, extended him credit and allowed him to play.
59;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-06-20T18:14:10Z;Romney hedges bets on gambling tycoon;;When he became Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney was so wary of being associated with gambling interests that he refused donations from the industry for his privately financed inaugural gala.He then floated a plan to keep gambling and its “social costs” out of the state, while reaping its benefits by asking casinos in neighbouring states to pay Massachusetts for instituting a permanent gaming ban.Mr Romney’s inhibitions are being tested in the 2012 election, however, by the businessman who is on track to become the biggest investor in the Republican candidate’s bid for the White House: Sheldon Adelson, the gambling tycoon and chairman of the Las Vegas Sands.Mr Adelson and his wife single-handedly carried Newt Gingrich during the Republican primaries by giving his supporters more than $20m – which paid for attacks on Mr Romney. With Mr Gingrich out of the race, they have donated $10m to the super-political action committee backing Mr Romney. The donation was made within weeks of a meeting between Mr Adelson and the candidate.A person close to Mr Adelson said he had not put financial limits on how far he is willing to go to support Republican candidates and causes in this election.For Mr Romney, the relationship with Mr Adelson is fraught with risk, as it invites scrutiny of the tycoon’s business record, especially his reliance on Beijing to sustain his profitable casinos in Macau, bordering China.John McCain, the 2008 Republican candidate and critic of the recent court decisions that opened the door to unlimited donations by wealthy businessmen, singled out the tycoon last week. Mr McCain said “foreign money” was being injected into the campaign in a “roundabout way”, as Mr Adelson earned most of his money through his Macau casinos. A spokesman for Mr Adelson declined to comment.Mr Adelson’s company is mired in a federal bribery investigation that stems from a wrongful termination lawsuit by a former Sands executive, Steve Jacobs, in 2010. Mr Jacobs, who used to run the Macau operations and whose attorney has said that he is protected under government whistleblower statutes, has alleged in court documents that Mr Adelson demanded he use “improper leverage” against senior government officials in Macau to obtain permits and that he was fired when he refused.The Sands has said the allegations are baseless and inflammatory and that the company is co-operating with the justice department investigation. Neither the Sands nor Mr Adelson has been charged with a crime.Mr Adelson is keenly interested in legislation affecting his industry on Capitol Hill. He has broken ranks with other gambling entities by announcing that he is opposed to a proposal that would legalise online poker playing. One gambling lobbyist told the Financial Times that hopes for the bill were significantly diminished, given Mr Adelson’s close ties to Eric Cantor, the Republican leader who controls which legislation is brought to a vote. More importantly, Mr Adelson’s business interests rely on a strong relationship between the US and China.Who are the biggest donors to super-Pacs, the organisations that can buy advertising for candidates?While Mr Romney and Mr Adelson share views on aspects of the China relationship, they differ sharply on the subject of human rights.In the case this year involving Chen Guangcheng, the blind China dissident, Mr Romney took a strong stand, saying “any serious US policy toward China” should take into account “violations of human rights”.Mr Adelson, whose casino business in Macau stands or falls on Beijing allowing its citizens to travel there, has by contrast advocated staying out of internal Chinese issues. “Look at the incredible progress China has made. How can someone say they’re doing the wrong thing?” he said at a time his business was taking off in Macau.According to The New Yorker magazine, when the Beijing mayor raised concerns about a human rights bill in Congress critical of China at a meeting in 2001, Mr Adelson on the spot called his Republican allies on Capitol Hill, including Tom DeLay. The bill was delayed. A spokesman for Mr Adelson declined to comment.Mr Adelson has supported US pressure on China to allow its currency to float and thus appreciate, which would lift the value of Chinese spending in Macau, something the tycoon described as “a grand slam home run, World Series, Super Bowl, and the NBA championship game all packed in one for us”.“We’re the largest investor of any kind in the history of China. Certainly we’re going to use any influence we have to see that the US policy and the trade representative policy is implemented,” he told the AP news agency in 2008.For different reasons, Mr Romney has said he will name China a “currency manipulator” on his first day in office.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week.

The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language.

61;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-06-05T16:21:10Z;Wynn Macau to spend $4bn on casino resort;;Wynn Macau will spend $4bn on its new casino resort in the former Portuguese colony, a figure considerably higher than analysts’ estimates.Steve Wynn, chairman of the world’s third-largest gaming company by sales, revealed the figure on Tuesday in Macau at the annual shareholder meeting of the Wynn Resorts subsidiary.Mr Wynn denied that costs had spiralled away from initial estimates, saying the final design had more hotel rooms than originally planned. Analysts said initial guidance the company had given for the investment was $2.5bn-$3bn.The Las Vegas mogul has a record of pursuing ambitious projects. He is best known for building the Bellagio and the Mirage in the 1990s – at the time, Las Vegas’s most expensive properties and setting a new standard for audacious style and room prices on the Strip.However, he was forced to sell those and other properties to MGM Grand in 2000 in order to pay off mounting debt.Mr Wynn said the new Macau resort, its first on the Cotai strip, would be financed by a mix of equity, debt and cash flow from Wynn Macau’s existing businesses.He refused to confirm reports that a $1.5bn bank loan had been lined up, saying the group had $2bn in cash and a strong balance sheet that would keep financing costs low.With its latest project, Wynn Macau is hoping to gain ground on rivals in the former Portuguese territory, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands already has four casino resorts there – three of them in Cotai.But recent signs of slowing growth in Macau gaming revenue and in China’s economy generally have battered shares of Macau gaming stocks including Wynn Macau.Since the beginning of May, shares of Wynn Macau and SJM Holdings, which is controlled by the family of Stanley Ho, have each dropped by about 25 per cent while Mr Adelson’s Sands China has fallen 15 per cent – all outpacing a 13 per cent fall in the Hang Seng index over the same period.Concerns were fuelled last week by data showing that total gaming revenue in Macau grew 7.3 per cent in May, the slowest pace since July 2009, and a Chinese manufacturing report underscoring the flagging mainland economy.Analysts were particularly concerned by indications that so-called VIP gamblers from China – who account for more than 70 per cent of Macau’s gaming revenue – appear to be spending less.“While detailed figures have not been released yet, we believe that the high-roller segment was the most disappointing. Our conversations with junket operators suggest that they have turned more conservative in credit offering, amid near-term economic and political uncertainties,” wrote Gabriel Chan, analyst at Credit Suisse, in a note to clients.Nevertheless, Mr Wynn said his company would not reduce the share of tables allocated to VIP rooms at the new property from the current 60:40 mix. The new casino will have about 500 tables and 2,000 hotel rooms and is expected to be completed in 2016-2017.“A $4bn investment on a VIP-centric property that opens its doors four years from now is a big bet on China’s VIP market and the fact that it will continue its strong growth rate,” said Gary Pinge, regional head of gaming and consumer at Macquarie Securities.Wynn Macau shares rose 1.7 per cent in Hong Kong on Tuesday.Additional reporting by Rahul Jacob in Hong Kong
62;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-05-08T18:57:17Z;Las Vegas;The city where US disposable income goes to be disposed is feeling the pinch;“They wanted the good life,” says hotel and gaming magnate Steve Wynn, of his father’s generation. “Casino gambling is colourful and dramatic and theatrical . . . They shot crap and bet baseball and football and were rather cavalier about their income for solid reason. They made it themselves.” The same phenomenon is happening today, only now in China, as the newly rich storm into Macau resorts to gamble and shop for luxury goods.But what of Las Vegas, where American disposable income goes to be disposed? If Vegas is the glittery, vulgar, scantily clad canary in the country’s economic coal mine, Wynn Resorts’ recent performance in the city is worrisome. In the first quarter, the company’s gambling revenues were down nearly a fifth from the year before. While this figure is always volatile, non-casino revenues, which had averaged double-digit increases over the past four quarters, were flat. Room prices were up, but occupancy dropped 9 percentage points. This is particularly troubling because of Wynn’s position at the high end of the market.A wider view is somewhat more reassuring. At Las Vegas Sands’ operations on the Strip, occupancy fell only slightly and prices held, as they did at MGM Resorts’ Strip properties, which reported rising occupancy. Aggregate data from the city’s Convention and Visitors Authority show that in the first two months of this year, visits and convention attendance were both up a bit, while room prices rose a healthy 8 per cent.Still, business is a big step below where it was in the wild years of 2006 and 2007. Improving occupancy or pricing further will not be easy, given the city has 17,000 more hotel rooms than it did at the height of the boom (several construction projects were too far along to stop when the crisis hit). Companies that have significant Las Vegas exposure – notably MGM and Caesars Entertainment, both of which also have heavy debt burdens – had better be ready to play a long game.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
63;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-04-09T14:54:16Z;Divisions over ‘Eurovegas’ plan for Spain;;City rivalries in Spain, as any supporter of Real Madrid or Barcelona knows, are at their most bitter when played out on a football pitch.That was until Sheldon Adelson, billionaire chairman of Las Vegas Sands, one of the worlds largest gaming operators, arrived in the country dangling the prize of a €18bn “mega casino”, boasting an avenue of skyscrapers housing 12 resorts, six casinos and 18,000 machines.Dubbed “Eurovegas”, the project – which is still in the planning stage ahead of a decision expected in the next three months – would be Europe’s first Las Vegas-style casino, designed to draw in the billion people living within five hours from Spain by air.With Spain mired in a downturn and 23 per cent of its population out of work, the prospect of a multibillion-euro investment, has seen both regional and national politicians consider making concessions that would have been impossible to imagine in better times.But while casinos are legal in Spain, Mr Adelson’s project has strongly divided opinion.Supporters view Mr Adelson’s offer as a possible solution to a languid investment outlook for both Madrid and Barcelona. Civil action groups that have sprung up in protest, argue that one of Spain’s two major cities will be turned into a modern day Gomorrah, wrecked by crime and prostitution.Mr Adelson has indicated to the delegations from Madrid and Barcelona that he hopes for some concessions. Planning regulations for the theoretical skyscrapers could be fast tracked, employment laws loosened and possibly even antismoking legislation softened by the winning city.Las Vegas Sands estimates that the project could bring in 11m new tourists each year to Spain and increase overall holiday spending by €15bn over the next decade. It also represents a potentially risky bet on the recovery of the eurozone by Las Vegas Sands, which has in recent years made the bulk of its foreign investments into the faster growing economies of Asia.Mr Adelson, the son of Lithuanian immigrants whose first job was selling newspapers, has gained a reputation as a hard-nosed and fierce negotiator, having fought rival magnates in Las Vegas, and expanded his company into Macao after it opened up it gaming market to foreign operators nearly a decade ago.In 2010 Las Vegas Sands opened the $5.5bn Marina Bay Sands casino resort in Singapore, which although constructed 50 per cent over budget managed in its opening year to generate the highest quarterly adjusted earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation of any property in the company’s history.The regional authorities of Catalonia and Madrid have been quick to make Mr Adelson feel wanted, identifying development sites, while at the same time talking up their advantages.“For our part there is a total disposition that Las Vegas Sands can build its towers up to the limit of the sky,” said Percival Manglano, economics adviser to the Madrid region in response to Barcelona’s unease at erecting potentially lurid skyscrapers.Esperanza Aguirre, the Madrid community’s popular but divisive conservative leader, and a leading figure in the ruling Popular Party, is seen by those following the beauty contest as having the edge.Intended to be built in three phases over 10 years, creating 260,000 jobs according to Las Vegas Sands, the project would, according to Ms Aguirre, allow “more than half of Madrid to find work”.Any economic advantages have not been enough to win over pressure groups and sceptical politicians, some of whom view Mr Adelson’s idea as opportunistic and potentially damaging for either Madrid or Barcelona if it goes ahead.For Eurovegas No, one of these groups, the project represents a return to the ethos of Spain’s build-it-high property bubble that has wreaked such damage since its implosion three years ago.Mr Adelson and Las Vegas Sands, ahead of showing their cards this summer, are hoping that Spain, will remain willing to play their game.
64;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-03-30T17:43:44Z;Moving in the right direction;Our columnists have a positive start to the year;Kevin Goldstein-Jackson, +2 per centThis year, I started to reduce the cash pile within my self-invested personal pension (Sipp). With low interest rates likely to continue for some time, I decided to take a more risky stance and invest in small companies which I hope have growth prospects.Best performer was oil minnow Wessex Exploration, in which I bought shares for my Sipp at 5.5p each on January 6. By February 23, they reached 6.58p – and then soared to 9.5p following a takeover approach by Total.Other oil interests in my Sipp also showed gains with Premier Oil rising from 363p to 412p, Westmount Energy 30p to 40p and Falkland Islands Holdings (which has a stake in Falkland Oil and Gas) jumped almost £1 per share. Shares in Northern Petroleum, bought for 75p per share on March 14, were 87p by March 23.My Sipp’s holdings in the pharmaceuticals sector have produced mixed results with Epistem rising from 360p at the start of the year to 405p, BTG up from 313.7p to 340.3p, and GW Pharmaceuticals (bought for 85.75p in January) rising to over 88.67p. But Immupharma dropped from 81.62p to 71.5p.Other disappointments include industrial engineer Weir Group, whose shares fell from £20.32 to £18.26 following reports of a profits warning by a US rival pump manufacturer. I believe Weir’s shares will rebound.I’m hoping Avocet’s will, too. They started the year at 184.5p and by March 15 were 227p. However, on March 16, 23.7 million shares in Avocet held by Datum AS were “successfully placed” at “a price of 200p” whereupon the share price promptly dropped to 201.2p. They are now down to 190.8p.Dina Iordanova, +7.5 per centMy contrarian stance in the face of the gloomy predictions at the end of 2011 has been rewarded in the bull market of 2012. But there is still much volatility and my holdings will need to be closely watched for moody reversals.Best performers year-to-date include Lamprell, Marks and Spencer, Brewin Dolphin and Aggreko.Kazakhmys had a spectacular run so I sold half of my holding for a good profit, only to watch the remaining half plunge and – in a manner typical for the mining sector – wipe out whatever gains had accumulated. Time and again, managing to sell in time has revealed itself as a most prized investing skill.Among my transatlantic assets, t he best advances have been in Las Vegas Sands and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD).Amazon, my favourite US bet, is finally on the move up. My benchmark US fund, the Fairholme Fund, has lifted itself from the doldrums but is still more than 10 per cent down on my original purchase.Nick Louth, + 9 per centMy portfolio is up 9 per cent so far this year, with decent rises all round.Apple, up by a quarter, contributed most. A smaller stake in Bank of America, on which I took profits of 48 per cent after holding it for less than 10 weeks, was notable – and even included a small dividend. Unusually for me, I was so sure of the direction of this bank that I took out a long spread-bet on its shares, too, on which I made 300 per cent in three weeks. I am very sparing in the use of such volatile derivatives.For me, the big asset allocation question was how firmly to switch out of defensive stocks and into growth and value plays. In retrospect, I may not have played it aggressively enough, my 12 per cent in cash really hasn’t earned its keep. Still, the eurozone crisis is dormant rather than extinct, I would rather keep some of the solid companies – from Vodafone to Hansard Global – which have reliably pumped out cash whatever the state of the markets.The columnists are active private investors, writing about their own investments.

The consumer technology company also reported “record activity” over the weekend for sales of its latest iPad tablet.Scott Sutherland, analyst at Wedbush, reiterated his “buy” rating and put a price target of $750 on Apple following Monday’s the announcement. “Apple continues to generate significant free cash flow and will be maintaining a cash war chest to execute on strategic opportunities. We are making some minor earnings per share adjustments in [our financial year] 2013 to reflect dividends but not repurchases,” he said.The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to its highest level since May 2008 at 1,409.75 and is now up more than 12 per cent on the year. US Steel Corporation led the risers on the benchmark US index, up 6.5 per cent to $31.64.Financial stocks propelled the index to cyclical heights to start the day but retreated in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 financial sector index gained as much as 1.2 per cent before finishing the day up 0.5 per cent.Bank of America, the best performing big bank stock for the year to date, crossed the $10 mark for the first time since last August in intraday trading, but finished the day down 2.8 per cent to $9.53 as traders speculated on rumours that the bank was going to raise capital through a share offering.“Contrary to market rumours, Bank of America has no intention of issuing additional equity in a secondary offering,” said a spokesperson at Bank of America. Shares rose 1.9 per cent in after-hours trading.Citigroup climbed 1.3 per cent to $37.17 after it sold its stake in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, netting an after-tax profit of $349m. Citigroup has risen almost 2 per cent since last Tuesday’s close when it was revealed that it was one of four banks to fail the Federal Reserve’s stress tests.Goldman Sachs was up 1.1 per cent to $124.30 as reports said the bank was considering offering “monoline” insurance to find new ways to expand its business ahead of new financial regulations.Morgan Stanley rose 2.7 per cent to $20.06, while Wells Fargo gained 1.1 per cent to $34.25. Capital One and the Bank of New York Mellon were both up more than 1 per cent at $55.10 and $24.51 respectively.E-Trade Financial, the electronic broker, was up 1.6 per cent and has now risen 41 per cent in the year to date.The Nasdaq Composite index was the best performer out of the three large US indices as technology stocks picked up momentum throughout the day. The index rose 0.8 per cent to 3,078.32 with Apple among the leaders. Close behind was Google, which added 1.4 per cent to $633.98.The day’s biggest loser was Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator by subscribers, which fell by 4.5 per cent to $2.76. The company was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” in a note by Bernstein Research which cited concerns that Sprint does not have sufficient “free-and-clear spectrum” to launch its latest LTE iPhone and maintains its “punishing” commitments to Apple.Craig Moffett, analyst at Bernstein, said: “Unfortunately, at this point we simply don’t believe there is any analytical framework that provides strong conviction as to whether Sprint can or cannot avoid bankruptcy over the next four years or so.“To be clear, we are not predicting a Sprint bankruptcy. We are merely acknowledging that it is a very legitimate risk. And notwithstanding a recent rally in Sprint shares, we believe that risk is rising,” he added.Priceline.com, the online travel booking company, gained 3.2 per cent to $696.93 to hit a 52-week high. Netflix, the home DVD delivery and online streaming company, continued its rally, up nearly 4 per cent to $114.33.Shares in UPS, the US package delivery company, added 3.4 per cent to $81.11. Over the weekend, the company said it would acquire TNT Express, its Dutch rival, as it plans to expand its footprint in Europe and China.Las Vegas Sands, the casino company, rose 4.5 per cent to a 52-week high at $59.12 on reports that its Sands Cotai Central casino in Macao would open next month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 13,239.13. Bank of America led the index for much of the day before softening in afternoon trading to finish as the index’s worst performer. American Express, the world’s third-largest payments network, gained 1.3 per cent to $57.27.Economic data released on Monday showed that US housing market sentiment remained flat in March, with home builder confidence holding steady from last month.
66;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-03-14T13:08:41Z;Las Vegas Sands sued over Macao licence;;Las Vegas Sands, the US gaming company, is being sued by a former business partner in Macao over the way it applied for a licence to operate casinos in the world’s largest gaming market.Asian American Entertainment, a private company registered in Macao, alleged in court filings that LVS, which is controlled by Sheldon Adelson, breached an agreement to jointly bid for a Macao gaming licence. AAE is seeking damages of 3bn patacas ($375m).LVS has not submitted a defence as yet and has two months to do so.The case marks the latest in a series of legal and regulatory challenges facing US casino groups operating in Macao, the former Portuguese colony, which produced more than five times the gaming revenue of Las Vegas last year.In one Nevada court case, LVS is fighting allegations, made by Steve Jacobs, the former chief executive of Sands China the subsidiary that operates the Macao casinos, that he was asked to collect information on senior Macao government officials to help the company “use improper “leverage” on local officials. Mr Jacobs also claims he was ordered to withhold certain sensitive information from the board of Las Vegas Sands. LVS denies all the allegations.Wynn Resorts, the gambling group controlled by Steve Wynn, has its own legal problems to tackle after it was sued by Kazuo Okada, its former vice-chairman, over the alleged mishandling of his investment and a $135m donation to the University of Macau last year. The legal action has prompted the US Securities and Exchange Commission to demand information from both parties.AAE’s allegations are related to events that began in 2001 when Macao said it would open its gaming market to competition and invited applications for gaming concessions to be issued in 2002. Stanley Ho, the Hong Kong gaming magnate, had a monopoly over Macao’s gaming market in the four decades since 1962.According to the English translation of court documents, AAE claims that Marshall Hao, its chairman, suggested to LVS that a casino “similar to the Venice-themed resort that [LVS] owned and operated in Las Vegas” would work in Macao. AAE decided to apply for a Macao casino licence together with LVS because it needed backing by a business with experience in running casinos, the filings said.AAE has accused LVS of terminating the contract unilaterally and entering into a competing agreement with Hong Kong-based Galaxy Entertainment in 2002 and then using research material jointly developed with AAE to submit a separate application for a gaming licence. LVS and Galaxy subsequently dissolved their partnership after they decided to pursue their own plans separately.LVS, which generated half of its 2011 revenue of $9.4bn in Macao, declined to comment on any details of the dispute.Jorge Menezes, the lawyer representing Asia American Entertainment, said that according to his client, one reason for LVS partnering AAE stemmed from the fact that it was unclear whether the Nevada gaming regulator, which oversees casinos in Las Vegas, would allow US casino operators to pursue Macao concessions on their own. Mr Menezes declined to comment on details of the lawsuit.Mr Menezes said AAE filed a breach of contract lawsuit against LVS in a Nevada district court in 2007 but that the case had been dismissed on procedural grounds.Little is known about Mr Hao, who also goes by the name Shi Sheng Hao and has dual Taiwanese and US nationality. He caused controversy in 2008 when he and his family donated more than $250,000 to John McCain, the then Republican presidential candidate, and other US politicians.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles
67;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-03-09T18:31:40Z;Brand new thinking on luxury shares;I thought Emporio was Giorgio Armani’s brother, writes Dina Iordanova;A few years ago, I was rather ignorant of luxury brands. I couldn’t tell my Bulgari from my Berlutti, and I thought Emporio was the name of Giorgio Armani’s brother.But, as I have spent more time in Asia, I have come to realise the key role luxury brands play in the minds of Asian consumers.First, there was my Thai doctoral student, who has been scrutinising teenage culture in Bangkok. According to her research, urban Thai youth would forego food just for the sake of acquiring at least one luxury item from Louis Vuitton or Dior – which they would want to buy at full price from the brand’s official store. No fakes, no bootlegs, no cut price or second-hand deals.Then, walking the streets around Aoyama in Tokyo, and the upscale malls of Hong Kong, I grasped that the trade in top luxury brands is there to stay. It is being fuelled by the newly discovered purchasing power of people free of the economic gloom that has settled in the west.These lessons learnt, it crossed my mind that building a portfolio comprising top-tier luxury brands could be a good inflation-proof strategy. These shares seem to have a lot going for them: momentum, good liquidity, speculative upside. Should I try to overcome my deep-seated prejudice that bags and rags cannot possibly be a serious underlying asset? Should I buy these shares, as they keep climbing even further– even if they appear overvalued?While exploring this idea, I came to realise that it might be easier said than done.Putting together my fantasy luxury portfolio would be hampered, first and foremost, by the fact that many luxury brands remain privately held and out of reach. Those that are publicly traded are listed on different exchanges in different currencies.Ralph Lauren, Estee Lauder, and Tiffany & Co are listed on the New York Stock Exchange in US dollars. LVMH and PPR are listed in Paris in euros. Antichi Pellettieri, Luxottica Group, Tod’s and Ferragamo trade in euros, but on Borsa Italiana in Milan. Prada trades on the volatile Hong Kong stock exchange in dollars – a market that, while accessible, has its own complex trading rules and follows its own logic.When one adds the need to go through currency conversion, and keep the related volatility in check, there are enough risk factors here to deter investors like me. For much the same reasons, I wouldn’t want to invest via a supranational luxury brands fund, either.So, how about the modest number of UK luxury brands?Well, while their shares keep climbing, I keep thinking I have missed the boat and they cannot possibly go up any further. I admit I have been thinking this for a year or so now – while watching in disbelief the unstoppable rise of Burberry, which is up more than 20 per cent in the year to date, and Mulberry, which has proved a staggering ten-bagger since its flotation in 2008 IPO, and is up 30 per cent in the past 12 months.For the time being, my only flirt with “luxury” is Las Vegas Sands, owner of casinos and, most importantly, of the indulgent Marina Bay Sands hotel and resort in Singapore.I bought into its shares not for the gambling revenues, but mainly because of my fond memories of the 150m-long infinity pool on the roof of Moshe Safdie’s fantasy complex, where scores of young girls flock to the shops in the adjacent luxury oasis.However, I am contemplating dipping my toe into other investments in the luxury sector.Dina Iordanova is an active private investor, writing about her own investments.

68;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-03-09T09:19:17Z;Vietnam’s local gambling dilemma;;"Is Vietnam about to legalise sports gambling? Despite positive noises from the Communist government, don’t bet on it happening any time soon.The plan, which has been discussed on and off over the last few years, has resurfaced again after Vietnam’s finance minister, Vuong Dinh Hue, visited Singapore to learn about the city-state’s successful sports betting industry.Following the visit, the finance ministry said in a statement on its website on Monday that it is working on a decree to legalise sports betting in order to minimise “social evils” and generate income for the state budget. The statement has since been removed from the website without explanation, in a possible sign of the sensitivities surrounding the issue.Vu Duc Dam, the chairman of the government office, subsequently confirmed that the government was considering proposals to legalise casinos and sports betting.Vietnamese, like many Asians, are avid gamblers but the Communist leadership officially deems it a “social evil” – alongside excessive drinking and prostitution – and betting remains illegal.There have been various attempts to legalise sports betting in Vietnam in recent years, including abortive discussions with Ladbrokes, the British bookmaker, back in 2007.Proponents say legalisation would channel gaming revenue to the state rather than illegal local bookies or offshore websites such as 188Bet, which advertises in Vietnamese on hoardings at English Premier League football grounds in order to attract Vietnamese customers who are watching the games on TV.It would also reduce demand for illegal gambling and make it easier for the government to deal with social issues connected to problem gambling.But for a Communist Party that still preaches about the need to fight social evils and follow the example of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam’s exalted independence leader, legalising any form of betting for locals would sit uncomfortably alongside the moral message.In addition to legalising sports betting, there has been a growing debate about legalising casinos in Vietnam, following the success of Singapore’s two so-called integrated resorts, which are set to surpass Las Vegas in terms of gaming revenue within a couple of years of operation.Malaysia’s Genting, which operates the Resorts World Sentosa casino in Singapore, has two casinos resort proposals on the cards in Vietnam, while Las Vegas Sands, which operates Singapore’s other casino, has also said it is keen to explore opportunities in this country of nearly 90m people.But Sheldon Adelson, chairman of Las Vegas Sands, has said he will only build a casino in Vietnam if the government allows locals to gamble.American casino groups MGM Resorts International and Pinnacle Entertainment are planning to operate casinos on the Ho Tram beach strip*, a couple of hours drive from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam’s commercial capital.But like the small casinos already in existence in the northern port city of Haiphong and the central resort city of Danang, only foreigners will be allowed to gamble there.Gaming industry analysts say that Vietnam has a lot of potential but that if it is serious about developing a casino industry, it must legalise gambling for locals and set up a proper regulatory system.“The government needs to make a clear decision on its gaming policy or it likely won’t be successful,” Paul Bromberg, the Thailand-based chief executive of Spectrum OSO Asia, a business risk consultancy that specialises in the casino industry, told beyondbrics. “We are proponents of a strong gaming regulatory environment as it gives confidence to investors and patrons. If Vietnam can find the political will to move in that direction, they could have a very successful gaming industry.”With Vietnam’s economy going through an extended rough patch and the government struggling to implement a broad wish list of reforms on everything from fiscal policy to the banking sector, the highly contentious legalisation of gambling is unlikely to be a top political priority.But, with growing pressure on the state budget, gaming executives will be hoping that financial needs will trump political sensitivities.*We previously wrote that American casino groups were building casinos in Vietnam’s Ho Tam strip. In fact, the casinos are being built by other investors, MGM and Pinnacle will operate them.Related reading:

69;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-03-02T20:27:19Z;Casino operators vie for Asian jackpot;;The bitter feud between Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas mogul, and his former ally Kazuo Okada has cast fresh light on how casinos are looking beyond Macao and Singapore for new growth in Asia.Wynn Resorts recently seized Mr Okada’s 20 per cent stake in the company, which runs casinos in Las Vegas and Macao, after accusing the Japanese gaming tycoon of bribing regulators in the Philippines and South Korea. Mr Okada denies the allegations.While South Korea and the Philippines have small gaming markets, casino operators hope to repeat the success they have had in Macao and Singapore. After overtaking Las Vegas in 2006, Macao now generates about six times more gaming revenues than the Nevada gambling haven.Singapore has shown even more dramatic growth since legalising gambling in 2009. Its two casinos – Sheldon Adelson’s Marina Bay Sands and Genting’s Resorts World Sentosa – had combined revenues of $6bn in 2011, putting the city neck and neck with Las Vegas, which has welcomed gamblers since the 1940s. Mr Adelson was cited by Bloomberg last year as saying Singapore had transformed the way casinos viewed Asia.“Singapore for us has opened up a new market for south-east Asia that most people did not understand existed,” he said. “For the youngest person in this audience, for the rest of their life, there will never be a saturation of the potential market in this part of the world.”Export-dependent countries such as Japan and Taiwan, which have kept out casinos to avoid unsavoury social problems, are now looking at Singapore with envy. Gary Pinge, an analyst at Macquarie, says Asian regulators are paying more attention to Singapore – and not the bigger Chinese territory of Macao – as it has showed that the industry can coexist with tight government control.Mr Okada, a 69-year old billionaire who made his fortune making pachinko machines – a cross between pinball and slot machines, which are popular in Japan – is now eying the Philippines. He plans to open his first self-branded casino resort in 2014, and boasts of turning Manila Bay into a “world-class entertainment, luxury shopping and prime gaming destination” with the $2bn investment.While Wynn Resorts accuses Mr Okada of courting Filipino gaming officials with lavish overseas trips and gifts, it and rival Las Vegas Sands say they have no interest in the Philippines.Aaron Fischer, head of consumer research at Asian brokerage CLSA, says Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing are the ideal places for casinos because mainland China makes up the bulk of Asia’s gaming demand. But there is no sign of these markets opening up soon.In the meantime, Mr Fischer adds, “major listed casino operators would be more comfortable investing in the more politically stable, mature economies like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan”.Mr Okada is looking to do just that. He plans to invest $4bn in a large casino resort in South Korea, which only has state-owned casinos at the moment – a move that industry experts say will pose a threat to western operators.Mr Adelson visited the South Korean city of Busan last week to study the potential for integrated resorts. But he and most foreign operators are waiting for Seoul to relax restrictions that, for example, ban locals from all but one remote casino.Mr Fischer says Japan remains the “holy grail”. A group of 150 Japanese politicians this month resurrected an effort to push through legislation to legalise casinos, which has been previously opposed by anti-gambling legislators on social and moral grounds.But a Japanese gaming consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it would take at least 18 months to enact legislation. When they are built, however, Mr Fischer expects Japan’s first casinos to generate more than $10bn in their first two years.“As an indication of Japan’s appetite for gambling, there are 12,000 pachinko halls and 5m slot machines in the country today. That’s five out of eight slot machines in the world,” he says.Most foreign operators refuse to discuss plans for Japan, but they are engaging in furious lobbying, according to casino executives. Mr Adelson also visited Tokyo last week where he told a conference that Japan would benefit from Singapore-style casino resorts.Taiwan is also seen as a potentially lucrative market after the government passed laws for casinos to be built on three islands located in the Taiwan Strait near mainland China. But there has been little progress since the people on one of the islands vetoed plans for the first casino in a 2009 referendum.But for now, the emerging market that has attracted a lot of interest from foreign casino operators is Vietnam. Stanley Ho, the ailing Hong Kong tycoon who was at the centre of a public feud over his vast gaming empire last year, has run casinos there for about two decades.Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International has also agreed to manage a property that is being built at a new beach resort 130km south-east of Ho Chi Minh City. Las Vegas Sands also plans a similar project in Ho Chi Minh City but has not released a timetable.See Lex
70;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Rich pickings to play for;With Asia’s casino revenues these days outstripping those of Las Vegas, a bust-up at a group that spans Nevada and Macao highlights cultural differences as well as the big sums that are involved;The Okada restaurant at the Wynn casino in Las Vegas is renowned as one of the finest dining establishments in a city fast becoming the culinary capital of the US. Its website boasts that the menu, which includes the Rainbow Roll (snow crab, cucumber, avocado and assorted sashimi) and Beef Tenderloin Robatayaki (cipollini onions and yakitori sauce), represents “Japanese cuisine elevated to an art form”.How much longer the restaurant will trade under the Okada name is unclear, after a week that has laid bare simmering tensions between Steve Wynn, the casino magnate who founded Wynn Resorts, and Kazuo Okada, the Japanese billionaire who invested alongside him.Wynn Resorts, which operates casinos in Las Vegas and Macao, has accused Mr Okada, who until this week owned a 20 per cent stake in the company, of giving bribes to international gaming regulators. The group has seized his stake, for which it will pay Mr Okada $1.9bn in 10 years, representing a 30 per cent discount to its market value. The action followed an independent report by Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which made the corruption allegations against Mr Okada. The claims were the subject of a court filing by the company in the Nevada district court on Tuesday.Mr Okada has denied breaking any laws. A representative said this week that the accusations levelled against him were “motivated by self-interest and represent the results of an incomplete and otherwise flawed corporate governance process”.The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the bribery and corruption allegations. It has also launched a probe into allegations Mr Okada has made in a lawsuit against the company about a $135m donation by a Wynn subsidiary to a university in Macao. He is seeking to block the seizure of his stake by applying for a temporary injunction.On Friday Wynn Macau, the group’s Hong Kong listed subsidiary, removed Mr Okada from its board.The unfolding saga and the tensions between Mr Wynn and the man of whom he once said, “I love Kazuo Okada as much as any man that I’ve ever met in my life”, underscore the shift in the industry’s centre of gravity from Las Vegas to Asia. Led by Macao, the former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong, a new and highly lucrative frontier has opened in that continent for US companies such as Wynn and Las Vegas Sands.Asian casinos are in line to generate total revenues of $58bn this year, according to estimates by PwC, the consultancy. Most of that will come from Macao, where revenues have soared by more than 30 per cent a year and are forecast to reach $44bn in 2012 – far outstripping Las Vegas, where gaming spending has slid to about $6bn since the financial crisis.Casinos in Singapore, which is not exactly known for excess and extravagance, are on the verge of overtaking Las Vegas and are estimated to have pulled in about $6bn in revenue in 2011 just two years after they opened. This has boosted the coffers of Las Vegas Sands, the only US operator with a casino in that country, and further enriched Sheldon Adelson, its billionaire chief executive, who is bankrolling the super-political action committee supporting Newt Gingrich’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.Mr Adelson and Mr Wynn have led the Asian expansion by Las Vegas groups. They were once bitter rivals, with Mr Wynn, who prides himself on his luxury properties, accusing Mr Adelson of running a “Walmart-style operation”. Their spat was played out in the pages of Las Vegas newspapers, yet the two have since patched things up, according to people close to them.They remain outsize personalities in an industry not lacking in colourful characters. Mr Adelson, who has a net worth of about $25bn, told Forbes magazine recently that he “might give $10m or $100m” to ensure Mr Gingrich wins the Republican nomination. Mr Wynn has appeared in television commercials for his Las Vegas Encore property apparently sitting on the edge of its roof some 48 floors up. He was friendly with the singers Michael Jackson and Frank Sinatra – he named one of his restaurants Sinatra at Encore in honour of the star – and once put an elbow through Le Rêve, the Picasso painting he was due to sell for $131m (the picture was repaired but the sale was cancelled).He is revered in the gaming industry for ushering in the era of the vast resort casino and his meticulous attention to detail. He opened the first 3,000-room hotel in Las Vegas (The Mirage) and turned the nearby Bellagio into a must-see attraction thanks to its dancing fountains, which shoot jets of water into the air in time to classical and pop favourites.“He concentrates on achieving excellence and is fastidious in his approach,” says Warwick Bartlett, chief executive of Global Gaming and Betting Consultants, an Isle of Man-based adviser on the industry. “He put a Ferrari showroom in the Wynn [hotel] in Las Vegas and no one thought it would work, but it now sells more Ferraris than anywhere else …he’s a pathfinder.”Mr Okada is a different kind of pathfinder, having made his fortune in Japan making pachinko machines. Pachinko, a hybrid arcade-style gambling game, is a popular pastime in Japan that nonetheless occupies a legal grey zone. Playing is lawful – flashy parlours can be found near any rail station or shopping arcade – but collecting money after a successful game is a violation of anti-gambling statutes. To get around these, parlours hand out token prizes that players trade for cash in back-alley kiosks – a fig leaf that has kept police and politicians looking the other way.Pachinko is certainly lucrative but Mr Okada has of late had his eye on richer pickings: developing a casino in the Philippines. Less than a month ago, he was looking triumphant at the groundbreaking ceremony for his $2bn Manila Bay Resorts project – the first casino the 69-year-old has built on his own.But his dream of turning his Aruze group into a global casino operator is at risk after Wynn Resorts accused him of infringing the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by hosting Filipino gaming regulators in $6,000-a-night suites and plying them with gifts and expensive meals. The report prepared by Freeh, Sporkin and Sullivan, the law firm run by Mr Freeh, alleges that the wife of one regulator received a Chanel bag.In the report, Wynn Resorts board members allege that Mr Okada spoke of needing to “follow the local culture” by giving gifts to government officials. The law firm interviewed all members of the Wynn Resorts board who were present at a meeting in February 2011. The report alleges that one board member “recalled Mr Okada stating that conducting business in the Philippines was all a matter of ‘hiring the right people’ to pay other people”, while another director remembered him “being ‘adamant’ during the FCPA discussion that it is not corrupt to give ‘gifts’ ”.“This report is in the heartland of the kind of allegations that have caused the [US] Department of Justice and the SEC to launch investigations,” says David Schindler at Latham & Watkins, another law firm.The rift between Mr Wynn and Mr Okada, who both declined requests by the Financial Times for comment, highlights the cultural risks that surround the expansion by western groups into countries where bribes to officials and regulators may be more socially accepted. “I’ve been involved in dozens of cases in Asia where people say that in order to do business in these jurisdictions you have to pay bribes,” says Mr Schindler.The danger for casino operators is that by adhering to anti-bribery laws from their home countries, they risk falling behind competitors in a region that is the world’s fastest-growing gaming market. “Companies from the US and UK, which have rigid bribery laws, risk being locked out of deals in Asia,” says Mr Bartlett.Yet students of Las Vegas history know US casino gaming has long suffered from its own problems with corruption and bribery. Organised crime got its hooks into Las Vegas the moment the gangster Bugsy Siegel drove there from Los Angeles in 1942 and decided the dusty desert town had potential as a tourist destination. Over the next three decades a succession of Mafia-related interests controlled several casinos in Las Vegas, their ownership often concealed from the authorities.When Mr Wynn visited as a boy in the 1950s, many of the city’s casinos were under the influence of organised crime. But by the late 1970s – the time of his ascendancy in Las Vegas – Wall Street firms and institutional money had replaced the Mob.Junk bonds financed Mr Wynn’s plans and a new generation of resort casinos was born: vast gaming palaces such as The Mirage and Bellagio, with thousands of rooms, luxury restaurants and top-class entertainment.As destinations including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and even Sri Lanka consider opening their gaming markets and offering casino licences, Mr Wynn and his rivals are waiting to pounce. But like every good gambler they will be aware that, besides the enticing rewards to play for, different cultural perceptions mean there are also significant risks.Additional reporting by Roger Blitz in London and Jonathan Soble in Tokyo
71;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Wynn Resorts: Chinese roulette?;A row between the founders of the casino group is dwarfed by fears over China;This isn’t baccarat. It’s mud-wrestling. Steve Wynn, chairman of Wynn Resorts, and Kazuo Okada, boss of Universal Entertainment, were once friends. They have made piles of money together opening casinos in Las Vegas and Macao. Mr Okada owns (or perhaps owned) a fifth of Wynn Resorts shares. But because of a disagreement over Mr Okada’s plans to build a gambling resort in the Philippines, thereby becoming a regional competitor, accusations of misconduct are flying back and forth. The Wynn Resorts board has voted to redeem Mr Okada’s stake at 30 per cent below the current share price, over a 10-year period.If Mr Okada can be forced to accept these terms, Wynn Resorts shareholders will be delighted. They become the beneficiaries of a very cheap share buy-back. But there will be a long legal wrangle, or a pricier settlement, before the last mud is slung. Wynn’s management has, at least, successfully set the terms of the dispute. The fight is, for now, about whether Mr Okada must accept a discount, not whether he can demand a premium. Well played.But should the conflict make smaller investors in Wynn Resorts nervous? If the prospect of bare knuckled business practices makes any of them jumpy, it is curious that they put their money to work in the casino industry. And if they are inclined to think about risks, they should think about business fundamentals first.Wynn is a very well-run company that has outperformed rivals Las Vegas Sands and MGM by 80 per cent and 120 per cent respectively over five years. But it is a concentrated play on China, which was the source of almost four-fifths of profit in the last quarter. That dependence will rise as it has another mega-hotel planned in Macao. A Chinese slowdown will turn the fuss over Mr Okada into a distant – even pleasant – memory.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
72;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;The Isa millionaire next door;Dina Iordanova’s shares rally and she finds a book uplifting;January was great for shares. Several of my holdings that had suffered declines have now almost or fully recovered.Mining stocks had a particularly good run – and my recently purchased shares in Kazakhmys have risen 20 per cent in the past month alone. Another recent buy, broker Brewin Dolphin, has enjoyed a ten per cent uplift, while my shares in gaming group Las Vegas Sands are up 17 per cent to a 52-week high.But the most miraculous recovery was in the shares of Robert Wiseman Dairies, which had seemed to be in a downward spiral of terminal decline. They jumped 60 per cent in price over two days on the announcement of a takeover approach from German yoghurt maker Müller. It looks as if I am in for a decent pay-off for my patience with the company.In fact, a glance at the share price chart for the past 12 months gives a textbook example of the uplift an acquisition approach can give.But all these uplifting stories aside, the most important investing experience for me in the past month has not been linked to my holdings. Rather, it has been reading Free Capital, by Guy Thomas – a valuable collection of interviews with successful UK private investors. It contains knowledge of a kind that I have found in short supply.Based on conversations with 12 successful present-day investors – including my fellow My Portfolio columnist John Lee – this elegantly composed volume brings the practice of investing to life. It gives concise portrayals of a variety of characters, each of whom has an individual investing style.They display some shared characteristics. They are all male and have amassed significant fortunes – which have given them the freedom to drop full-time jobs and focus primarily on investing. Deep down, they are all individuals who have not only recognised the power contained in this character quirk but have also capitalised on it.Beyond that, though, they represent a fairly diverse group. They live all over, from Kent to Yorkshire to Sheffield to Switzerland – and not necessarily in posh mansions. Some are educated to PhD level, while some left school at 16 and are autodidacts. Some have backgrounds in banking and finance while others have never been involved with the City. Some of them are from ethnic minorities and some have suffered a confining illness.They have made their money at differing rates, too. Some had success with “ten-baggers” whereas others capitalised on boom periods and sold off in time. Some have held stocks for many years, but one jumps in during the unruly first hour of trading and sells just hours later. Some seek “value moats” – as in Warren Buffett’s phrase to describe an unassailable competitive advantage– whereas others analyse “candlestick” charts of share prices. Some mainly trade in blue-chips while others rely on microcaps. Some use derivatives for short selling, whereas others spend time on shareholder activism.What resonated with me is the feeling of proximity: these people live in Britain, today. They use the same information sources like most of us, the same brokers and research tools. They read and post to the same bulletin boards and are subject to the same individual savings account (Isa) limitsLearning of their path was educational and uplifting. Next door, living within the same conditions and facing the same constrains, there are investors who thrive!Dina Iordanova is an active private investor, writing about her own investments.

73;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Gamble on Gingrich yet to pay off;;Sheldon Adelson used to give a book to visitors to his Las Vegas office, a plush suite past the indoor canals and singing gondoliers in the heart of the Venetian casino. “You need to read this,” he once told the Financial Times after an interview, taking one of several copies of Dore Gold’s The Rise of Nuclear Iran from a large pile. “Everyone should read it.”As a passionate supporter of Israel, the idea of a nuclear-armed Iran is of deep concern to Mr Adelson, whose $22bn fortune makes him one of the richest men in the US. In addition to the Israel-related causes and charities he supports, Mr Adelson has deployed his wealth to influence US political races – most recently when he and his wife gave $10m to a super political action committee supporting Newt Gingrich.Their donation represents a tiny part of the wealth the Adelsons have amassed through their large stake in Las Vegas Sands, the casino group that owns the Venetian as well as other gaming resorts in Macao and Singapore. Yet the donation – and the television advertising it paid for– has kept Mr Gingrich’s hopes alive against the better-financed Mitt Romney as the primary race enters a critical stage.Mr Adelson and Mr Gingrich first met at a reception at the US Capitol in October 1995, and “hit it off immediately”, according to a person close to Mr Adelson. Over the years, the ties between the two men have deepened – but it was Mr Gingrich’s stance on a contentious plan to relocate the US embassy in Israel that convinced Mr Adelson to back the former House speaker with hard cash.Mr Gingrich has vowed to use his presidency to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the country’s capital. The plan was plan endorsed by the US Congress, which passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act in 1995 when Mr Gingrich was speaker of the House. However, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have all refused to implement the law because of the potential impact on peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.Mr Adelson views Mr Gingrich as a courageous politician while his wife, Israeli-born Miriam Adelson, has been known to compare the former House speaker to Winston Churchill, according to a person who knows the couple. The question now is whether the Adelsons will dip into their pockets once more to provide the funds to help Mr Gingrich claw back Mr Romney’s poll lead and compete in upcoming primaries in Maine, Missouri, Minnesota and Colorado.Mr Adelson, who declined requests for comment, is the son of Lithuanian immigrants who got his first job as a boy selling newspapers after school. He still speaks with the hard-edged Boston accent of his youth and has over the years fought for top dog status in Las Vegas with rival gaming magnates – namely Steve Wynn, who developed luxurious upscale properties like the Bellagio and the Mirage.The two have regularly traded barbs in the Las Vegas press, although relations have recently improved. Mr Wynn once accused Mr Adelson of running a “Walmart-style operation”. Their rivalry intensified when the gaming industry expanded to a new, highly lucrative frontier in Asia, first Macao, where both men operate resorts, and more recently Singapore.Mr Wynn and Las Vegas Sands were competing for a licence to operate a casino resort in Singapore until Mr Wynn withdrew. “He quit,” Mr Adelson once told the FT. “He didn’t want to lose to Sheldon Adelson.”Mr Adelson would eventually win the Singapore licence: the property he built, the Marina Bay Sands, generated a $1.5bn of profit in its first year of operation, according to the company’s quarterly earnings this week.The money that Mr Adelson has earned from his resort casinos would have been beyond the comprehension of his father. “His father told him that when he got off the boat from Lithuania, he kissed the ground,” says a person close to Mr Adelson. “He said, ‘Dad, why did you do that?’ His father replied: ‘Son, don’t ever forget that the United States of America is the greatest country that God ever created.’”Mr Adelson made his first millions when he created the Comdex computer trade show but became one of the world’s wealthiest men after acquiring the Venetian and leading the expansion into Macao. With resort casinos in Asia to manage, the 78-year old Mr Adelson told investors this week that he spent 700 hours in the air last year.He can afford to travel in some comfort: several model jets, representing his personal fleet, hang in his office. He owns two Boeing 747s, capable of flying from Las Vegas to Macao nonstop, a 737 and a 767 and has also made his jets available once a year for injured army veterans and their families to take all expenses-paid trips to the Venetian.He has given more than $100m to the Birthright Israel Foundation, which takes young children to Israel, and is a close friend and ally of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. He supports a tough, non-negotiable defence of Israeli sovereignty and its borders, but it is in the US where his money could have the biggest political impact – particularly if it allows Mr Gingrich to mount a credible challenge to Mr Romney. As he growled on an investor call this week: “No one ever accused me of being a shrinking violet”.
74;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-01-19T17:35:31Z;Rockin’ the boat: a call for casinos;New York’s attitude to gambling has always been inconsistent;"If Nathan Detroit were alive today and picked up his copy of the Daily News, I think it’s fair to say he would scarcely believe his eyes.For those of you who don’t know the name, good old reliable Nathan was a gaming industry entrepreneur in the musical Guys and Dolls, who descended into a sewer to secure a proper home for his business – the oldest-established, permanent-floating crap game in New York.And what’s in the Daily News these days that would cross up a guy like Nathan? I’ll tell you what’s in the Daily News: stories from the political world showing that the Nathan Detroits of today aren’t hiding in sewers anymore; they are too busy making friends with some of the fancier folks above ground.Go to South Carolina and you’ll see Newt Gingrich, the Republican presidential candidate from the red state of Georgia, fighting for conservative principles with the help of a $5m bundle of lettuce supplied to a sympathetic super-political action committee by Sheldon Adelson, chairman of Las Vegas Sands, a gaming company.Stick around these parts and you’ll hear Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic governor of the blue state of New York, offering to hand over his marker to Malaysia’s Genting group in the hopes that a state-of-the-art casino can be built at the site of the Aqueduct racetrack (which, coincidentally, is in Mr Cuomo’s home borough of Queens).It almost confirms the observation of that state senator from Illinois who used to say there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there’s the United States of America. When it comes to shooting craps or feeding the slots, we are one nation, under the spell of the gaming interests and looking for action at the hundreds of legal casinos now in operation across the country.As Nathan knew, it wasn’t always this way in the US. The old-time religion in this country had little room for casinos and little regard for people who benefited from the proceeds of such operations – a category that now includes a civilising force like Mr Gingrich.There was a time when US conservatives sounded Billy Sunday, a former professional baseball player who became such a famous Christian evangelist that nightclub singers of today who pay tribute to Chicago for its “toddlin’” tendencies still note it was “the town that Billy Sunday couldn’t shut down”.Sunday was such a relentless campaigner against gambling (as well as dancing, drinking and the theatre) that he even believed a social game of cards in a family home was wrong. “Every pack of cards is but another stepping stone to Hell,” he warned his followers.Nathan would surely have been more comfortable with Mr Cuomo, if only because the New York governor speaks the (borough of) Queens English. But I wonder what Nathan would have made of Mr Cuomo’s high-minded sales pitch for casinos.Mr Cuomo has cast himself as an agent of progress and a foe of hypocrisy in proposing a $4bn joint venture with Genting to build a convention centre and casino at the Aqueduct site. This reflects New York’s inconsistent attitude about casinos. Technically, they are banned, but in practice the state allows five casinos on Indian reservations and 29,000 electronic gaming machines at nine “racinos”, the name for casinos at horseracing tracks. Mr Cuomo essentially called on New Yorkers to face facts and take a more systematic approach to raising revenue through gaming.“We have long flirted and dallied with another potential economic engine – casino gaming – and when it comes to gaming, we have been in a state of denial,” he said. “It is estimated that over $1bn of economic activity from gaming can be generated in our state. Therefore, let’s amend the (state) constitution so that we can do gaming right.”But doing gaming “right” involves some measure of wrong – at least, if you view such things from the kind of progressive political perspective Mr Cuomo usually espouses. The odds at a casino favour the house, which means money is redistributed from the dice rollers to operators such as Mr Adelson or Genting’s Lim family (who, to use the Occupy Wall Street terminology, are clearly members of the “1 per cent”).Nathan and his crowd knew the score. In their song of praise for “good old reliable Nathan”, his gambling pals in Guys and Dolls proclaim: “If the size of your bundle you want to increase/ He’ll arrange that you go broke in quiet and peace.” He was a regular public servant, that Nathan."
75;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-01-09T19:36:55Z;Casino tycoon bets $5m on Gingrich;;Sheldon Adelson likes a fight. The billionaire Republican donor transformed Las Vegas with the construction of a vast conference centre at his Venetian casino to the great chagrin of his rivals, such as Steve Wynn. He also defied convention when he helped develop Macao as a gaming destination, building casinos that have eclipsed anything ever constructed in Sin City.Now he hopes to transform the Republican primary race with a $5m donation to a super-political action committee that is backing Newt Gingrich. The “Winning Our Future” super-Pa c has acquired a controversial film that portrays Mitt Romney, the leading Republican candidate, as a predatory capitalist and destroyer of jobs.The film forms the basis for a new series of commercials to run in South Carolina ahead of its primary on January 21 and is more evidence that the latest stage of an already bitter campaign has entered an increasingly acrimonious phase. With a large personal fortune and campaign war chest, Mr Romney has more money to spend than his rivals: super-Pacs backing Mr Romney were instrumental in eroding support for Mr Gingrich in Iowa.But with Mr Adelson in his corner, Mr Gingrich, the former speaker of the house, has a deep-pocketed supporter intent on helping him reverse the poll declines that saw him lose his front-runner status.The son of a Lithuanian immigrant – and Boston cab driver – Mr Adelson’s first job was selling newspapers on street corners: he and his friends often suffered at the hands of Irish youths. But he had a sharp entrepreneurial streak and started a vending machine business before training to become a court reporter.He would make his fortune in travel and tourism and realised early on that there was money to be made in leisure when he started a charter tours business. He became a millionaire when he created the Comdex computer trade show. But it was his epiphany that Las Vegas could become the natural home for business conventions that set him on the path to becoming one of the world’s richest men.As chairman of Las Vegas Sands, he runs one of the world’s biggest gaming companies: it invested in Macao when other US gaming groups faltered and was handsomely rewarded when the enclave became the world’s biggest casino market thanks to the fervour – and willingness to spend – of Chinese gamblers.The backgrounds and platforms of some of the declared candidates and others who have expressed interest in runningHe weathered a severe storm in 2008 when the financial crisis and consumer downturn caused the near collapse of several large casino groups. He put $475m of his family’s money into Sands but the move paid off: Sands shares have since rebounded.A vocal supporter of Israel and a generous philanthropist, he has poured millions into Jewish causes and also owns a stake in the Israel Hayom newspaper.A close ally of Benjamin Netanyahu, he has opposed a two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and has expressed deep concerns about moves by Iran to develop its uranium enrichment programme. He also recently backed Mr Gingrich’s controversial comments about Palestinians being “an invented people”.“Read the history of those who call themselves ‘Palestinians’,” he told an audience in Israel recently, “and you will hear why [Newt] Gingrich called them an ‘invented people’. There are a number of Palestinians who will recognise the truth of this statement.”
76;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2012-01-03T11:01:01Z;Macao gaming revenue surges in 2011;;Macao’s gaming market grew at a rate that defied even the most bullish expectations last year to become five times bigger than Las Vegas, powered by the eagerness of China’s nouveaux riches to gamble.The former Portuguese colony on Tuesday announced that December’s gaming revenue rose 25 per cent from a year ago, taking the year’s total to $33.5bn, up 42.2 per cent from the previous year.“Following the 57 per cent growth in Macao’s gaming revenue in 2010, nobody expected the market to grow at the rate that we have seen. At the beginning of 2011, we were expecting a 20 per cent growth for that year, and we were among the most bullish in the sector,” said Aaron Fischer, Asia head of consumer and gaming research at CLSA.The world’s largest gaming centre survived 2011 untouched by a severe credit tightening cycle and a sharp slowdown in export demand, which had a punishing impact on business and the property market in China.Macao is the only Chinese city where casinos are allowed to operate and the market has captured the rise in the nation’s wealth by expanding more than 17-fold in the last decade. The average disposable income of a Chinese urban dweller has been growing at about 9 per cent a year, based on official statistics.At the heart of Macao’s phenomenal growth was the Chinese people’s penchant for games of fortune. Revenues in the city’s casinos could eventually exceed the whole of the US market, which currently yields $60bn in a year, Mr Fischer said.“It’s true that Americans are still a lot wealthier on average than people in mainland China, but I would guess that a Chinese gambler would bet up to 10 times more than his American counterpart,” he said.Hong Kong-listed gaming stocks had a rocky ride last year, however, as they suffered periodic waves of sell-offs as investors feared that they had finally succumbed to China’s monetary tightening measures.The share prices of casino operators such as Sands China, Wynn Macau and Galaxy Entertainment still managed to end the year 20-60 per cent higher than a year ago as they continued to report strong profits, which helped soothe concerns about their outlook.Companies known as junket operators, however, ended the year about 30 per cent lower despite the fact that none of them had fallen victim to the credit crunch so far. They provide credit to high-rollers who make up two-thirds of the Macao market, and collect gambling debt, which means that they would bear the brunt of a rise in bad debt and the drying up of funds.Analysts said Macao’s rate of growth could this year slow to 15-20 per cent – mainly because the size of the market had become so enormous, while new casino capacity would be limited.

The US insurer sells a consumer debt insurance product in the eurozone.Coal miners Peabody, Cliffs Natural Resources and Alpha Natural Resources were all among the top 10 fallers in the S&P 500, down between 5 and 7.5 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8 per cent to 11,766.41 and the Nasdaq Composite index was off
1.3 per cent to 2,523.14.Homebuilder stocks were barely given a boost by a rise in the National Association of Home Builders confidence index to 21, its highest level since May 2010, from a revised 19 in November. PulteGroup fell 3 per cent to $5.59. DR Horton fell 2 per cent to $11.76.Even Lennar, considered by many analysts the most attractive US homebuilding stock because of the company’s low level of debt, fell 1.4 per cent to $18.51.Zynga fell 4.7 per cent to $9.05. The social game developer is trading 95 cents below its $10 initial public offering price after falling 5 per cent on its market debut on Friday.Groupon shipped 4.5 per cent to $22.00, just $2 above its own IPO price, as Stifel Nicolaus became the latest underwriter of its IPO not to recommend the stock to clients, as it initiated coverage. Stifel analysts called the discount offers website, “the internet’s overgrown toddler”, on account of its “get big fast” strategy.Cablevision Systems climbed 2 per cent to $13.00, recovering some ground after falling 8.5 per cent on Friday when Tom Rutledge, chief operating officer, unexpectedly said he would quit the cable company without offering a reason.Citigroup analysts said the market reaction was “a touch extreme” and urged clients to buy the stock at a compelling valuation.Las Vegas Sands fell 2.6 per cent to $40.46 even after the casino company’s China unit said an investigation by Hong Kong stock market regulators for alleged breaches of regulations had ended.Rival Wynn Resorts fell 3.3 per cent to $102.20.AT&T fell 0.4 per cent to $28.74 amid reports that the mobile phone network was stepping back from talks on asset sales intended to help gain approval for its acquisition of T-Mobile USA.That would suggest the company may be giving up on the T-Mobile purchase in the face of regulatory hurdles.Yahoo slipped 2.2 per cent to $14.63 despite reports after the market closed on Friday that private equity groups interested in taking a minority stake in the internet portal might raise their per share price from the $16.60 reportedly offered previously."
78;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-12-15T21:27:49Z;Romney inches ahead of Gingrich in Iowa;Sustained assault on former House speaker by rivals;Mitt Romney, shaping up as the tortoise in a Republican field of hares, is regaining ground in the race for the party’s 2012 nomination after a sustained assault on the latest frontrunner in the contest, Newt Gingrich.Ahead of the final Republican debate of the year on Thursday evening, the former Massachusetts governor inched past Mr Gingrich in a Rasmussen poll of voters in Iowa, where the race’s first ballots will be cast on January 3.Although polling of the caucuses in the farm-belt state varies greatly, Mr Romney’s gains are aligned with a concerted advertising and on-the-ground offensive in Iowa against Mr Gingrich by a number of his Republican rivals..The campaign against the former House speaker has the backing of the Republican establishment on the east coast, which fears Mr Gingrich would be thrashed in a general election against Barack Obama.After months in which the race has been dominated by “anyone-but-Romney” campaigning by a right wing that regards him an insufficiently conservative, the establishment is now taking over, training its sights in a panic on Mr Gingrich.The dismay that Mr Gingrich could become the party’s candidate was underlined by a damning editorial in the National Review, the conservative flagship magazine.The magazine slammed what it called Mr Gingrich’s “impulsiveness, his grandiosity and his weakness for half-baked (and not especially conservative) ideas”, and the way he combined “incendiary rhetoric with irresolute action”.“Gingrich has always said he wants to transform the country. He appears unable to transform, or even govern, himself,” it said.Mr Gingrich needs to win Iowa to maintain the head of steam he has gathered in recent weeks, but he has little of the campaign infrastructure essential for the door-to-door campaigns needed to rouse support in the state.The former speaker is in a rush to raise funds, with Politico, the Washington publication, reporting that Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and conservative activist, was preparing to give millions of dollars to the Gingrich campaign.Mr Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands has been the largest single donor to Mr Gingrich’s Washington-based non-profit organisation, donating $6.5m since the 2006 election cycle.The backgrounds and platforms of some of the declared candidates and others who have expressed interest in runningMr Gingrich continues to maintain a healthy lead in national opinion polls as the preferred Republican candidate to face Mr Obama in next year’s presidential poll, but it is the state-by-state battle that matters in finding a candidate.In Iowa, Mr Gingrich is facing his strongest challenge from Ron Paul, a libertarian conservative who has an enthusiastic support base in the state.Along with other candidates, such as Rick Perry, the Texas governor, Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann, Mr Paul will be in Iowa almost full-time until the caucus. Mr Gingrich, however, who has little organisation in the state, will not be.The shifting polls also coincide with something less orthodox for a Republican race – the two leading candidates attacking each other over their wealth and private sector work experience.At a time when Republicans in Congress have been accusing Barack Obama of “class warfare” for his push to lift taxes on millionaires, Mr Gingrich attacked Mr Romney for “bankrupting companies and laying off workers” as a private equity executive.Mr Romney, with a personal fortune of an estimated $250m, is also taking pot shots at Mr Gingrich’s wealth, saying that the former speaker’s $500,000 credit line at Tiffany, the jeweller, meant he was “not a middle-class American”.
79;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-11-18T21:55:41Z;Garden state;Seductively curvaceous greenhouses and eccentric ‘Supertrees’ are transforming Singapore;"It may sound odd but since the 1960s Singapore has been slowly remaking itself as a garden city. Tiny, dense, hyper-urban and constantly clawing back land from the sea to accommodate its booming centre, the city-state has nevertheless seen green tentacles creeping into every corner, every central reservation, every sliver of leftover sidewalk. Plants here thrive in the year-round tropical climate and grow in the most obscure places. The effect is impressive: a skyscraper city framed by palms and blooming bougainvilleas.But no matter how green the city is becoming, it has always been defined more by its architecture than its horticulture. Most recently, Marina Bay Sands, an unimaginably vast casino and hotel complex, has become the city’s de facto symbol. Desperate not to loose out to the urban hubs emerging in the Middle and Far East, Singapore set out to attract tourists by building the most expensive hotel the world has ever seen. At a cost of more than $5bn, it surpasses even the dripping gold of the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi.The hotel is built on reclaimed land, across the bay from the city’s Central Business District, and operated by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. At 57-storeys high and with 2,561 guest-rooms, the structure straddles the city like a colossus. Singaporeans are discouraged from visiting by a S$100 (£49) levy on entrance; tourists can enter for free. Despite this, the casino, along with another in nearby Sentosa, is set to surpass the whole of Vegas in revenue (though not Macao, which is in another league). Singapore – puritanical and strait-laced, with its abiding acceptance of law and order and its aversion to chewing gum – finds itself in an uncomfortable position: its most iconic building, the one which symbolises its skyline like no other, is its “IR”, or “Integrated Resort” (they can’t quite bear to call it a casino). And apart from its surfboard-shaped roof garden, it isn’t very green at all.The city’s solution has been to counterbalance the casino by constructing a huge green Eden, the Gardens by the Bay project, which is due for completion next summer. Singapore’s answer to New York’s Central Park, the gardens comprise a green corona which will encircle the bay to create a ring of almost continuous green space at the centre of the expanded city, transplanting its heart from the crowded colonial centre with its familiar landmarks (Raffles, the old post office, now the Fullerton Hotel and the rest) to a new CBD. It has realised that towers, the ubiquitous signifier of commercial modernity, are not enough to make it distinctive, but this garden certainly is.Stand on top of the Integrated Resort (the best thing about it – you can’t see it from its own roof), look down and what catches your eye is not the city’s dense matrix of towers but a pair of seductively curvaceous greenhouses and a forest of diaphanous steel mushrooms. To a northern European, there is something desperately counterintuitive about building a greenhouse in the tropics but here they’ve been employed to introduce non-native species in a theatrical burst of colour largely absent from the rainforest greens of local vegetation. The structures are stunning. Designed by Wilkinson Eyre, an international architecture firm based in London, they look much like the inheritors of that very British tradition of glass houses which led to Crystal Palace and Kew’s Palm House.Vast roofs stretch into the distance with the lightness of a spider’s web. The larger, flatter greenhouse, the Flower Dome – open temporarily this weekend to host the World Orchid Festival – covers nearly 200,000 sq m, rises to 38m and creates an artificial world which resembles the 1960s sci-fi visions of lunar greenhouses. Its landscape embraces bulbous South American trees, huge succulents, African baobabs and vast fiery carpets of red and gold flowers. The other “biome” is taller, its structure like a wave of glass and contains a simulated mountain up which grows the greenery of a tropical forest. Its roof reaches 58m and it creates an extraordinary landmark, a crystal mountain in the city’s flat, watery centre.Wilkinson Eyre has made a successful habit of creating elegantly, and seemingly effortlessly, engineered structures that quickly come to define new or revived city centres. The firm’s “Winking Eye Bridge” over the Tyne has become a symbol of Newcastle’s regeneration; the 100-storey International Finance Centre in Guangzhou is one of the slickest skyscrapers of recent years; and the cable car in London’s Docklands (currently under construction) looks set to redefine this disconnected, desolate flatland.These greenhouses are the finest thing the firm has done. But they are not the only structures in the gardens. Equally prominent are the eccentric “Supertrees”. Designed by the gardens’ Bath-based landscape architects Grant Associates and London engineers Atelier One and Atelier Ten – in a curious echo of a colonial past this is a completely British project – the trees are a forest of steel armatures which rise between 25-50m, their structures composed of a complex, twiggy network of steel. They are designed to act as frames for climbing plants, creepers and “epiphytes” which clad the trees of the tropical rainforests.The guiding spirit behind the gardens is Dr Kiat W Tan. “We need to grab people’s attention,” he tells me, “and these structures are about creating a ‘wow factor’. Education is good, but without entertainment no one will pay attention.”Tan has high hopes for what the gardens might achieve. “They can teach civic manners – for example, how to use and inhabit public space. But they also create a sense of belonging. This is prime real estate in the Central Business District and yet people can feel they own a bit of it, and that this is their park. It counterbalances the casino, a paradise to its mammon with buildings that become condominiums for plants.”The gardens represent a huge civic investment – S$1bn spent on the greening of prime land – but the city is clear that it creates value. Just like Central Park, the plots around the gardens will become highly desirable, massively raising their value in an already expensive location.The project is not, of course, only for Singaporeans. The city is already a magnet for tourists: its location serves as a genuinely cosmopolitan metropolis at the heart of Asia, which makes it popular with Chinese and Indians, as well as with Westerners looking for that touch of Asian exoticism minus its chaotic flipside. The gardens, with their delicate ecosystem of burgeoning tropical growth and carefully controlled spread, have become the perfect metaphor for this meticulously and intelligently-planned city. And what a nice touch that even the plants have been given megastructures and skyscrapers to allow them to compete with the city on equal terms.Edwin Heathcote is the FT’s architecture correspondent………………………………….DetailsEdwin Heathcote was a guest of Singapore Tourism Board (www.yoursingapore.com), Singapore Airlines (www.singaporeair.com) and Fullerton Hotels.

80;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Caesars Entertainment revives offering plan;;Caesars Entertainment, the debt-laden casino group, has revived plans for an initial public offering a year after pulling a planned listing because of concerns about market volatility.The owner of Las Vegas casinos including Caesars Palace, the Flamingo and Planet Hollywood pointed to positive trends in the business and leisure travel market in a regulatory filing. It added that the possible legalisation of online gambling in the US could open up a lucrative new market.The renewed IPO push comes amid a flurry of other deals, with Groupon, the daily deals operator, completing a listing and Zynga, the online social gaming group, due to float this month. As many as nine companies are seeking to complete listings in November.Caesars was taken private at the peak of the bull market in 2006 by Apollo Global Management and TPG, the private equity investors, in a highly leveraged $17bn deal. The company has close to $20bn of debt, according to Tuesday’s regulatory filing.But since its purchase, Caesars – formerly known as Harrah’s – has struggled to restructure its debt amid the global recession and an economic downturn that has wreaked havoc in Las Vegas, its biggest market.The company was further weakened by its lack of presence in the booming Macau gaming market. Caesars failed to secure a gaming licence in Macau and could only watch as rival companies, such as Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, capitalised on a market which has grown larger than Las Vegas.In Caesars home Las Vegas market, the opening of MGM Resorts’ $9bn CityCenter project increased room capacity in the city at the worst possible time, which has depressed room rates for rival operators. Several high-profile casino developments have also stalled, such as the billion dollar Echelon and Fontainebleau projects, while the city leads the US in mortgage foreclosures and unemployment.However, there are signs of a rebound in visitor numbers to Las Vegas, which attracts a large share of US convention trade. Furthermore, Caesars, owner of the World Series of Poker, would be a prime beneficiary if lobbying efforts succeed at reforming US online gambling laws.Caesars said in the filing it was “better positioned than our competitors” to take advantage of “new opportunities” in the gaming industry. “We are the only US land-based casino company that owns an online gaming business,” it said.Caesars said it planned to raise $50m in the IPO, far less than the $530m it hoped to raise in its scrapped IPO from last November.
81;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Macao casino operators hit by China fears;;Macao casino operators were hit by large falls in their share prices on Friday as investors became increasingly nervous about the impact of the slowdown in the mainland Chinese economy.Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands, the US gaming groups now making most of their profit in Macao, saw shares in their Hong Kong-listed subsidiaries lose 17 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, their worst one-day performance since listing two years ago.SJM, the largest gaming group in the Chinese territory by market share, fell 8.7 per cent and MGM China dropped nearly 12 per cent. The Hang Seng index was down 2.3 per cent amid a general equity sell-off in the region but the gaming sector was the worst hit.The gaming industry in the former Portuguese colony has been a success story amid the global economic slowdown, with revenue expected to reach US$34bn this year, more than 40 per cent higher than last year and five times more than Las Vegas’s 2010 revenue.However, it is highly dependent on mainland China, with big spending Chinese responsible for more than two-thirds of chips bought in Macao, according to casino operators.The sell-off appears to have been triggered by rumours that some junket operators were in trouble. These are companies responsible for drawing so-called VIP gamblers to Macao casinos by extending them generous credit and, sometimes, by being flexible about debt collection.One junket operator – Grand Korea Leisure – has stopped extending credit to mainland Chinese high-rollers. The Seoul-based company, which has a small Macao operation, said the move was temporary and a repeat of a “credit clearing” exercise that saw it halting VIP credit for two months last year. It did not give a specific reason for the latest move.A junket operator in Macao who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was not aware of rivals experiencing a credit crunch. However, he had heard of mainland Chinese investors pulling capital from their investments because of monetary tightening at home.“There are many wealthy factory owners from the east coast of China who have been making good returns from Macao simply by lending money to junket operators in return for 1-1.5 per cent in monthly interest. They have seen Macao as a profitable sideshow to their real business, which is experiencing a slowdown. However, some of them are in need of cash at home and have trouble borrowing from banks. So they are cashing out from Macao,” he said. So far, this only had a limited impact on the junket operators, he added, as they were still seeing strong growth in business.Analysts on Friday said Macao’s growth would not continue at the current pace because the market had become so big and Chinese visitors could be spending less if there was a marked slowdown in the mainland economy. However, they predicted a gradual slowdown rather than a hard landing because recent data were encouraging. August gaming revenue in Macao rose 57 per cent year-on-year to US$3bn, while the number of visitors to the city rose 14.4 per cent to 2.7m.“Investors were spooked by slowing growth in China and they want to lock in profits after strong gains by stocks such as Wynn Macau and Sands China over the past year,” said Philip Tulk, analyst at the Royal Bank of Scotland.Following Friday’s sell-off, Wynn Macau shares were still up 47 per cent from a year ago while Sands China shares were up 33 per cent.
82;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-09-26T20:58:27Z;Casino stocks hit by fears of Asian slowdown;;Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands slid to their fifth consecutive sessions of losses, and Melco Crown Entertainment its fourth in five, as investors fretted that a potential slowdown in the Chinese economy might effect their casino operations in Macau.“There seems to be an awful lot of concern that a slowdown in the Asian economies will reduce the funding that’s available for the corporate junket business, which is really the engine of these businesses’ growth in Macau,” said David Katz, an analyst at Jefferies.Wynn depended on its Macau operation for about a third of revenue, LVS for more than 40 per cent, and Melco for almost its entire business, Mr Katz said. All three operators are now down more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday, significantly underperforming the broad S&P 500.On Monday Wynn was down 1.4 per cent to $136.78, off more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday. LVS fell 1.6 per cent to $43.69, down 11.2 per cent over the five days. Melco fell 3.3 per cent to $9.85 and is off almost 17 per cent since Tuesday.But most analysts said company data did not suggest a slowdown was imminent. Carlo Santarelli, gaming analyst at Deutsche Banks said, “I’m not seeing anything fundamental out of Macau to make me believe there is anything changing in the VIP. I think the share price moves are more reflective of general macro fears in the equity markets.”Elsewhere, the S&P 500 bounced a healthy 2.3 per cent to 1,162.95, to snap a five day slump, driven by a strong rally in bank stocks.Financials in the S&P 500 rose 4.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector. Citigroup jumped 7 per cent to $26.72 and JPMorgan was also up 7 per cent to $31.65. Bank of America also outperformed the sector, up 4.6 per cent to $6.60, as crisis meetings involving European and American officials once again raised hopes of a solution to the eurozone crisis, which has battered bank stocks.Gains for big banks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 2.5 per cent to 11,043.86, but the Nasdaq Composite index, which has a lower weighting of financials, and whose bank stocks tend to be small domestic lenders, lagged behind, up only 1.4 per cent to 2,516.69.Consol Energy was the best performer in the S&P 500, gaining 9 per cent to $37.17, after announcing the $193m sale of royalties on a Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to Antero Corporation.Berkshire Hathaway shares rose 8.1 per cent to $108,449, after Warren Buffett’s company announced it would use some of its $48bn cash hoard to repurchase shares. The buy-back programme allows for unlimited purchases as long as the stock is trading at a premium of less than 10 per cent of book value, and the company’s cash pile remains above $20bn.Netflix was up 2.2 per cent to $132.22, despite reports of a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream the studio’s content. Netflix’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent in recent weeks after it broke off negotiations to renew a content contract with the Stars cable network, and a move to separate its streaming and DVD delivery business lost it up to 1m subscribers.Expedia, the online travel company, jumped 4.7 per cent to $28.44 after Piper Jaffray analysts upgraded the stock to “buy”, arguing international bookings could account for 50 per cent of revenue by 2013.Clorox Company, the cleaning products manufacturer, was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 4.3 per cent to $66.44, after investor Carl Icahn withdrew his nominees to the board of directors, citing shareholder resistance to his attempted buy-out of the company. Clorox had been up almost 10 per cent for the year before Monday on expectations of a takeover.With the S&P 500 down 17 per cent from its April 29 peak at the start of the day, most analysts notes on Monday were discussing the probability of a bear market and how to position for it.Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley’s US equity strategist, said the high correlation among sectors in the S&P 500 leaves few obvious defensive plays. Less than a quarter of healthcare stocks and only half of consumer staple stocks have a correlation to the index of less than 0.9. The 80 per cent of utility stocks, which are exhibiting low correlation to the S&P 500, may be the best bet for investors expecting the market to enter bear territory.But, Mr Parker warned “low beta stocks have seen a recent increase in trading volume relative to high beta stocks”, which has driven up prices, so investors would have to pay a price to buy into defensive stocks.Two less intuitive candidates for defensive plays are exchanges and brokers. Exchanges have seen trading volumes spike during recent market volatility, which has increased revenue. Several analysts have recommended buying into the sector, and Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and Intercontinental­Exchange have all outperformed the S&P 500 since July 25.On the day, Nasdaq OMX was 0.3 per cent higher at $24.47, CME Group had gained 0.7 per cent to $259.83 and Intercontinental­Exchange had risen 0.4 per cent to $122.58.But Alex Kramm at UBS, who has “buy” ratings on all three names, said: “We still think there’s value in exchanges as a defensive play within financials.”The New York Stock Exchange is down 29 per cent since July 25, almost twice the fall in the S&P 500, although it has largely moved in tandem with potential merger partner Deutsche Börse, so has suffered from falls in European markets.Despite NYSE’s underperformance, “I’d hesitate to pick it as a favourite given uncertainty around the merger”, said Mr Kramm.Brokers have also benefited from a sharp rise in trading volumes. In a note last week Brad Hintz at Bernstein Research said Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and LPL Investment Holding, all of which have significantly underperformed their indices, had “relative near-term opportunities” from elevated trading volume.But on Monday he revised down earnings per share estimates for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, arguing that the impact of depressed IPO and M&A activity on investment bank earnings would outbalance any sharp rise in revenue from their brokerage businesses. He predicted Goldman Sachs would deliver a 20 cent loss per share in the third quarter.
83;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Macao faces diversification challenge;;The excited chatter of the Chinese tourists in the faux renaissance lobby of the Venetian Macao nearly drowns out the tour guides shepherding them to the main attraction in the hotel: the casino floor.“My heart is pumping. I have no idea what I’m supposed to do inside, but I aim to win!” says a beaming 40-something Shanghai office manager on his first visit to the gambling haven of Macao.Four years after Las Vegas Sands opened the Venetian, the $2.4bn complex – which includes an indoor “Grand Canal” where gondoliers belt out arias in Italian, English and Chinese – is stillpopular with tourists who want a taste of the “Las Vegas of the east”.Since Portugal handed its former colony back to China in 1999, the territory has seen a surge in visitors from roughly 650,000 a month to 2.6m a month today. Annual gaming revenues, which were $2.2bn in 1999, are expected to reach $34bn this year – five times more than Las Vegas.This growth has, however, spurred concerns about overreliance on gaming. The Macao government, which collects more than 80 per cent of its revenue from gaming taxes, wants to turn the enclave into a conference and entertainment destination, and requires casino operators that want to expand to build non-gaming facilities. While the government is laying heavy emphasis on conference facilities, operators are also mulling plans for more family friendly facilities such as amusement parks and cinema multiplexes.About 55 per cent of visitors to Macao come on day trips and spend just a few hours gambling before heading home. Even those who stay spend an average of 1.4 nights, compared with 3.6 nights in Las Vegas, according to studies by gaming associations.“There is a big emphasis on diversification. The days of building a …casino with a couple of hotel rooms attached to it is essentially over,” says Edward Tracy, chief executive of Sands China.Despite the challenge, the attraction for casino operators is obvious. Macao is also the only place where operators enjoy annual revenue growth of 40 per cent. The staggering accumulation of private wealth in mainland China, where casinos are banned, is expected to keep it growing.Gaming also translates into ready profits. Wynn Macau’s interim net profit to June 30 was HK$2.4bn (US$308m), up 27 per cent from a year ago. Sands China’s first-half net profit rose 115.4 per cent to US$539m.But casino operators are entering uncharted territory when they build facilities such as the Venetian’s 1.2m sq ft of conference and exhibition space. Since building a large resort in Macao can cost several billion dollars, the investment has a negative impact on investor returns for at least a couple of years.In balancing the desire to expand with the government’s order to diversify, the listed operators face a challenge trying to achieve a return on invested capital – a common benchmark for measuring how efficiently a company uses its capital – of about 20 per cent in Macao.The Venetian’s ROIC was 5.8 in its first year of operation while Sands Macau – a casino with very little in non-gaming facilities that opened in 2004 – had an ROIC of 31.8 in its first year. Wynn Macau, which is not expected to open its own diversified resort until 2015, recorded an ROIC of 89.1 last year.Analysts say that aside from the short-term investment return concerns, there is no guarantee that Macao will see long-term, sustainable demand for non-gaming facilities just because they are there.Macao faces strong competition for non-gambling business from Hong Kong, another Chinese special administrative region with better transport and conference facilities and a better reputation overseas. It must also compete with Guangdong, the southern manufacturing-heavy province where many large trade fairs are held, says Gabriel Chan, analyst at Credit Suisse, adding that some executives may be shy of visiting Macao.“Casinos are sensitive venues, There will be company CEOs who don’t want to be seen going into one, even if he or she is just attending a conference under the same roof,” he says.Mr Chan says it will also take Macao time to build up enough of a range of non-gambling attractions, such as Cirque du Soleil which has permanent show at the Venetian, before significant numbers of visitors will start coming solely for its entertainment facilities.So while Macao may want to find a cure for its gaming addiction, most visitors for a while yet will continue to come for one reason alone – an opportunity to test their fortune.
84;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-09-16T17:02:45Z;Show must go on in eventful August;I’m glad I missed RBS’s woeful performance, says Dina Iordanova;August is always an eventful month for those who, like me, are based in Scotland. Once again, Edinburgh turned into a powerful magnet for cultural tourism with a series of events that, even if temporarily, outshone the woeful proceedings on global stock exchanges.On August 16, I found myself moderating a festival panel event in the series Continental Shifts, dedicated to Asia’s incessantly rising popular culture. Its focus was on Bollywood’s worldwide exports, on the global presence of Japanese manga comics, and on the ascent of South Korea’s cultural offer. A week later, on August 23, I went to the King’s Theatre for Haruki Murakami’s The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, one of the highlight events.But, while revelling in the enjoyment of this year’s Asia-themed offers, I could not shrug off the feeling of feast amid plague. On August 16, at the height of the Book Festival, the shares of its main sponsor, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), traded at 26p – down from about 40p in early July. By the time of my second visit on August 23, they had gone down 25 per cent, to 20p – a rock bottom level, comparable only to February 2009.Even so, at the events held in the RBS Main Theatre on Charlotte Square Gardens, not a single speaker voiced worries over the future of RBS’s sponsorship. At the debate entitled ‘Can Edinburgh Remain the World’s Leading Festival City?’, anxieties instead focused on competition from the Olympics. I am not sure if this lack of concern over RBS was tacit bullishness or artistic obliviousness! Anyhow, I haven’t owned RBS shares since the 2010 festival – when I sold at over 50p in anticipation of a government pull-out.As far as my current holdings are concerned, my portfolio has emerged from this eventful August with a similar valuation to that of a month ago. As I am still clinging to Barclays, I was badly hit by the shares’ 12 per cent fall in a month – and 55 per cent decline on my original purchase price.Luckily, these losses have been offset by advances made by other stocks. My good performers include Petropavlovsk, up nearly 30 per cent since August 11, followed by Pan African Resources, up 22 per cent, Polo Resources, up 21 per cent, as well as Las Vegas Sands, up 18 per cent and Barrick Gold, up 9 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. If these advance some more, I may even gather strength and take my losses on Barclays.Looking at the choppy price chart for my overall portfolio in August, I realise it is not dissimilar to the curve of the fund that I hold for benchmarking purposes – Bruce Berkowitz’s Fairholme, which has behaved equally choppily and currently stands at about the same low level it was at a month ago.At the end of August, I also made three purchases of what I perceive as momentum stocks: Weir, Aggreko and Burberry.Weir went up rapidly but was particularly volatile, so I sold within a matter of days after it hit my trailing stop loss. Still, I managed to collect a 7 per cent profit. Meanwhile, Aggreko and Burberry, after some yo-yo bounces, are now back to the level at which I purchased them. I am hopeful that at least Aggreko will resume its upward trend.Dina Iordanova is an active private investor, writing about her own investments.

86;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-05-26T16:00:04Z;Macao: all bets are on;;The Chinese woman in the red fleece tracksuit slowly curls back a corner of one of the two playing cards lying face down in front of her. It is the five of hearts. At her table, shared with a dealer and three Chinese men, not a word is spoken. The only drinks in sight are tea and water.The woman breaks the back of her second card on the green felt. The six of hearts. This is a lousy hand for baccarat. The dealer sweeps up the chips the woman wagered, and she hops to the next table, looking for better luck.The minimum bet at this table in Macao’s City of Dreams casino is HK$2,000 ($257). While a big step up from two-cent slot machines, the stakes – and the privacy – are comparatively low. Casinos in Macao, the former Portuguese colony on China’s south-east coast, also have invitation-only, VIP baccarat rooms where HK$2m wagers are commonplace.To appeal to high rollers, the Encore Tower at the Wynn Macau resort opened last year with four 7,000 sq ft “villa” suites, each joined to its own gaming salon. Past the front door, framed by loops of tennis ball-sized Swarovski crystals, a spokeswoman tells the Financial Times that riding the lift to a top-floor VIP gaming area could jeopardise client anonymity.In such exclusive confines, cash is little seen and even the gaming chips are different. Unlike the round chips bought with cash from a dealer or cage in the public area, rectangular VIP chips are in essence loans provided directly by the casino or through appointed middlemen, with the gambler settling losses after the visit. “Why carry cash if you can get credit anywhere?” says a senior Macao casino executive.The gaming companies have been playing a similar game, borrowing heavily to build huge casino hotels while counting on the winnings to pay the debt. More than $11bn has been spent over the past five years on casino hotel construction in Macao, a city of just half a million people.The global financial crisis highlighted the stakes. Construction on some projects ground to a halt. Las Vegas Sands, the US operator with the biggest bet on Macao, saw its share price drop 99 per cent, while Sheldon Adelson, its controlling shareholder, tumbled from his perch as number three on Forbes magazine’s list of the richest Americans. But the downturn was short. Last year, gambling revenues for Macao were up by more than half from 2009 to 188.3bn patacas ($23.5bn) – more than the combined take of all the casinos in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, according to PwC.VIP betting and credit have been behind Macao’s swift rebound. Betting turnover began to recover after China prodded state banks to pump up lending as part of a Rmb4,000bn ($616bn) stimulus programme in 2009. This flood of liquidity arrested a slowing of the mainland economy and revived confidence.Macao casinos ramped up lending, too. Outstanding credit to gamblers and middlemen quadrupled in less than three years to about $1.1bn by late 2010, according to UBS, the Swiss bank.Such figures underplay the volumes involved. Macao government revenue figures imply, based on statistical win rates, that last year high rollers made almost $600bn in total wagers on baccarat, the only game played at VIP tables. Industry insiders say that 90 per cent of VIP betting is done on credit, putting last year’s volume on a par with total world purchases using Visa credit cards between October and December.The casinos, though, have been cautious with direct lending to gamblers. They have nothing comparable to the electronic database services in the US, which help judge the creditworthiness of a new customer. Gaming debts cannot be legally enforced in mainland China, and outbound fund transfers are restricted. Moreover, Macao’s 40 per cent gross tax on casino takings makes no allowance for unpaid VIP credits.Given those odds, a senior gaming executive says his credit lines are largely restricted to gamblers with established track records and Hong Kong private banking accounts. Instead, most VIP credit is through middlemen. Their role in identifying potential high rollers outside Macao is critical, as gambling advertising is prohibited in mainland China, the source of up to 90 per cent of the city’s VIP players.Melco Crown Entertainment, the New York-listed owner of the City of Dreams complex, has ties to 72 so-called gaming promoters, the highest tier of middlemen who usually hold exclusive rights over certain VIP tables. Each operator in turn has a network of agents in different cities. Asia Entertainment & Resources, a New York-listed promoter with VIP rooms in three Macao casinos, has about 1,500 agents.However, given their penchant for privacy, luring big fish is not easy. “You need to be familiar with the people in a particular city to make connections,” says Hoffman Ma, deputy chairman of Success Universe Group, a gaming company that made headlines by buying Michael Jackson’s white rhinestone glove at auction for $350,000 to use as a casino promotional tool. Ma says non-gaming affiliates in Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing and Shenzhen help identify prospects.“China is so big you can’t know everyone,” he says.On the mainland especially, promoters tread discreetly. “Gambler recruiters do not tell target customers their real intention in the beginning,” CLSA, an Asian brokerage, said in a recent report. “Usually the recruiter would tell the targeted individual that he is running a travel agency based on Macao. If the friend-making process is successful, a friend-accompanied free trip to Macao will be proposed.”Gaming promoters receive allocations of rooms, ferry tickets, show seats and meals for their clients from the casinos and, in turn, take a cut from the volume bet or lost on credit.The key step in preparing for a trip is assessing the prospect’s assets. “It is very costly to identify customers,” says Samuel Tsang, whose family helped pioneer the VIP business in Macao in the mid-1980s. “You must know their backgrounds to know what their repayment ability is.”To fund a month’s lending to gamblers, Macao’s middlemen require at least $6.5bn in working capital, based on calculations by CLSA. They get that via credit from the casinos as well as their own equity and debt financing. The brokerage reports that some operators are paying interest of 1.5-3 per cent a month to investors.The workings of credit settlement between middle-men and gamblers are necessarily murky given Chinese law. Success Universe’s Ma says gamblers often put down cash, stock or property deeds as collateral before a trip. And if the collateral fails to cover the debt afterwards? Nicholas Niglio, chief operating officer for Neptune Group, one of the biggest gaming promoters, says obliquely: “The key is ‘face’ and knowing your customer.”Until several years ago, there was no legal framework for gaming credit, even in Macao. Organised gangs, known as triads, helped fill the vacuum in lending and moving money securely across borders. When Macao went into recession in the late 1990s after a property bust, the triads clashed violently for position in the VIP market.In 1999, as China prepared to resume authority over Macao from Portugal, Beijing cracked down on gang warfare and backed the opening of the casino market to new competitors to widen the city’s appeal to families and conventioneers who might stay longer and spend more outside the casinos than the Hong Kong day-trippers who then dominated visitor flows.Macao’s tourist trade has blossomed since the old casino monopoly ended, with the city’s visitor count rising from 10.3m in 2001 to 25m last year. New shopping arcades, theatres, sporting events, trade shows and extra hotel rooms have had a minor financial impact given the unexpected surge in VIP betting, that was responsible for almost three-quarters of casino revenues last year.This is driving change. The Plaza, the Las Vegas Sands-operated casino linked to the Four Seasons Hotel Macao, has set up a new premium slots area behind a privacy screen on its main gaming floor and converted a restaurant into a high-stakes table games area. Another area has been sectioned off for two new VIP salons.In the connected Paiza Mansions building, big gamblers are provided with complimentary suites of up to 8,000 sq ft. The “basic” two-bedroom model includes a hair salon room, two massage rooms, a fitness centre, a sauna, a 12-seat dining table, a piano, a laundry room, a full kitchen, an extra-large safe and a karaoke lounge, which Jacqueline Wu, the building’s spokeswoman, says “is quite important for the mainland Chinese”. To transport such guests, the company uses a fleet of more than 71 limos, including a Maybach, a Bentley and a Rolls-Royce Phantom, as well as several private jets.For a big gambler travelling with family, such luxuries or the presence of certain shops and restaurants can sway the choice of casino hotel, says Neptune’s Niglio. More important are the rebates high rollers have come to expect on their betting volumes. At Wynn Macau, for example, they get back 0.9 per cent of what they wager, according to CLSA.The loyalties of the middlemen have also been influenced by rising commission levels and higher credit lines as Macao’s old monopoly morphed into a battle between six casino operators. Initially, US-based operators hesitated to engage with junket promoters, because of worries that the previous era’s criminal legacy might jeopardise their standing with US regulators. But as Macao instituted a licensing system and a credit law, they began wooing the middlemen to tap their lucrative flows of high rollers.Few see the build-up of credit risk as a serious danger to the casinos, given allowances made for bad debt. “The absolute level of exposure is still healthy,” UBS concluded in one report, while noting more recently that MGM Resorts, one of the US-based operators, had been indirectly hit by a $16m credit default.“There’s basically no repayment problem,” says a senior Macao casino executive, but he admits concern that some casinos have stopped asking high rollers to deposit a cheque when opening a credit line. This leads gamblers to demand the same from other casinos. “Why are you not giving me face?” quotes the executive.Defaults have already had an impact on some Hong Kong companies that invested in gaming promoters. Amax Holdings recorded HK$2.3bn in losses on unrecovered loans to its agents last year. Dore Holdings, a rival, noted: “Most of the junkets in Macao have encountered liquidity problems due to difficulties in debt collection.”This could become a wider problem if the VIP betting flow slows. Outside Macao, concerns linger over how junket agents do business and with whom. MGM Resorts is selling its casino in New Jersey to meet an ultimatum from regulators there, who are disturbed by the family links of the company’s Macao joint venture partner.Chinese media reports on corruption cases continue to cite examples of officials embezzling public funds to gamble here. In March, the US urged Macao again to strengthen oversight of junket operators and cross-border currency movements to fight money laundering.Should the veil of privacy slip, options will remain for cautious Chinese high rollers, including the fleet of cruise ships that sail nightly from Hong Kong into international waters. “A boat is a more private location,” says Ma of Success Universe, which owns one of the gambling ships. “There are people that can’t be seen in a casino.”
87;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-05-24T16:57:27Z;Spain to take a gamble on selling its lottery;;Spain is pushing ahead with a plan to privatise the country’s state lottery in a sell-off that will transform one of its oldest national traditions into the world’s largest stock market listed gambling company worth as much as €25bn ($35.2bn).The planned stock market listing of 30 per cent of Loterías y Apuestas del Estado, organiser of the country’s El Gordo, or the Fat One, Christmas lottery, is part of a planned multibillion-euro sale of public assets to slash government borrowing by a third this year.Spain’s socialist government, which suffered its worst defeat in the post-Franco era in this week’s regional elections amid protests in city centres, has also said it will sell 49 per cent of the state airports authority that controls Madrid and Barcelona airports to raise an additional €8bn.The planned autumn sale of the state lottery, which traces its roots back 199 years to Spain’s first modern lottery draw in Cadiz, is expected to raise between €6.5bn and €7.5bn. If completed it would create Europe’s most valuable listed gaming group and the biggest Spanish offering on record.Millions of Spaniards play the lottery each year, attracting revenues of €9.8bn on an average spend of €210 for each member of the population in 2009, or €77.36 each after prizes of €5.9bn.The thousands of prizes paid out in last Christmas’ El Gordo, or “Fat One”, lottery – including top rewards of €3m – came at a time when 22 per cent of the adult Spanish population are registered as unemployed.Loterías, which was established in its current form in 1985 by royal decree to unify Spain’s various state gaming enterprises, reported a net profit of just under €3bn in 2009, with €2.92bn going to the Spanish treasury.At the top end of its estimated value Loterías would be worth more than the top two gambling companies Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, making it the largest in the world by market value.Madrid is expected to officially announce a bank that will act as financial adviser for the sale this week, officials said, and will later select five investment banks to sell the shares in the company to investors.Lazard is viewed by company insiders as a favourite to manage the process, with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley among several others that are in the running for other roles, which count among the most prestigious investment banking mandates on offer in Europe this year, according to bankers.The sale of Loterias comes as several of Spain’s troubled private savings banks, known as cajas, are rushing to attract private investors after the Bank of Spain judged the sector as a whole to need an extra €15bn to cover soured loans made during Spain’s decade-long property boom.El Gordo, which last Christmas paid out €2.3bn in 1,700 prizes after a number picking ceremony in Madrid where school children sing out the winning numbers, is the largest Christmas lottery pay-out, with an estimated four in five Spaniards purchasing tickets.Tickets, which have a face value of €200, are frequently split into smaller amounts – often between co-workers, family and friends.
88;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-05-04T21:51:22Z;Energy leads further Wall Street retreat;;"US indices retreated further from multiyear highs achieved last week after disappointing economic data, softer commodity prices and a number of lacklustre earnings reports.The sharpest falls came from the energy sector, with National Oilwell Varco, the oilfield services company, falling 3.4 per cent to $69.92 and Cameron International losing 4.1 per cent to $48.70.ExxonMobil, the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, was down 0.9 per cent to $84.81 as the oil price fell back. The S&P energy index was off 1.6 per cent.“The fall in commodity prices should eventually be a good thing for the markets but in the meantime it is weighing heavily on the energy and material sectors,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.Energy stocks had led the rally in US equities over the past six months.Since the end of September, the S&P energy index has risen 49 per cent while the broader S&P 500 index is up 28.5 per cent.But this pattern has started to change in the past few weeks, with April the first month in almost a year where energy stocks did not outperform the benchmark S&P 500 index.The S&P energy index is down 1.2 per cent this month.Material stocks also lost ground in the session. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, fell 3.9 per cent to $51.14 while Cliff Natural Resources lost 4.1 per cent to $87.55. The S&P materials sector was down 1.7 per cent.These losses left the S&P 500 index down 0.7 per cent to 1,347.32 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.7 per cent softer at 12,723.12, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,828.23.Weak economic data weighed on sentiment across the wider markets, leaving all of the major S&P sectoral indices trading lower.The biggest disappointment was over the ISM non-manufacturing composite index, which plunged to 52.8 in April from 57.3 the previous month in a worrying sign of the rate of growth in the US services sector. However, a reading above 50 still indicates expansion.Separately, employment data from Automatic Data Processing estimated that the private sector had added 179,000 jobs in April, below the 200,000 economists had expected. The ADP data is significant as it is the first in a slew of crucial employment numbers to be released this week.The big event will be on Friday, when the official, monthly non-farm payroll numbers are set to be released, but before that there are the weekly numbers on Thursday.Some weak earnings results also kept market sentiment lower. Las Vegas Sands fell 7.4 per cent to $42.50 after the casino resort operator missed analysts’ earnings and revenue forecasts.Elsewhere, Kellogg, the cereal company, reported a 12 per cent drop in earnings and slimmer gross margins for the first quarter, sending its shares down 1.2 per cent to $56.78. Investors reacted negatively to the news as the maker of Rice Krispies and Pop-Tarts became the latest in a long line of companies to feel rising commodity costs.Last week, Procter & Gamble said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.Kimberly-Clark and Nike have also reported weaker results this season thanks to higher commodity prices.In deal news, Applied Materials, the US semiconductor equipment maker, announced plans to buy rival Varian Semiconductor in a $4.9bn cash deal. The news sent shares in Varian up 51.3 per cent to $61.36, while Applied Materials lost 1 per cent to $15.09.Elsewhere, ConAgra Foods announced it had made a $4.9bn cash offer to acquireRalcorp, the cereal maker, in a deal that would make ConAgra the third-largest US packaged foods company by revenues.This sent shares in Ralcorp up 4.9 per cent to $87.39 while ConAgra Foods added 3.1 per cent to $25.51.Renren, China’s leading real-name social networking service, saw its shares surge 28.6 per cent to $18.01 on its trading debut in New York.The Beijing-based company, which is unlisted in China, had priced its initial public offering at $14 per share to raise $743m, at the top of its projected range
of $12-$14."
89;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-03-31T18:34:41Z;Sands China in regulatory probe;;Sands China, the Macao casino group controlled by Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson, has revealed it is being probed by Hong Kong’s securities watchdog for alleged breaches of regulations.The news comes a month after the company’s New York-listed parent, Las Vegas Sands, disclosed that US federal and state authorities were investigating its compliance with laws that prohibit bribing foreign officials.Shares in Sands China slid 5.7 per cent to HK$17.36 in Hong Kong on Thursday.In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, the company said it had been asked by the Securities and Futures Commission to produce “certain documents” but declined to provide any details.People familiar with the matter said the SFC investigation was launched several months ago, independently of the US investigations.Lawyers and analysts on Thursday speculated that the SFC probe might be connected to a wrongful termination lawsuit filed in the US last year by Steven Jacobs, the former chief executive of Sands China.Mr Jacobs alleged in a Nevada court filing that he was fired “without cause” last year, after resisting “repeated and outrageous demands” by Mr Adelson to “use improper ‘leverage’ against senior government officials of Macao”.Mr Jacobs also alleged he was asked to “refrain from disclosing truthful and material information” to the Sands China board, “so that it could decide if such information relating to material financial events, corporate governance, and corporate independence should be disclosed …to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange”.The SFC regulates all companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and has been taking a harder line against companies that provide false or misleading information to the public.Mr Adelson has said Mr Jacobs’ accusations are baseless.Speaking about the US probe at a conference this week in Las Vegas, Mr Adelson said: “When the smoke clears, I am absolutely, not 100 per cent, but 1,000 per cent positive that there won’t be any fire below it. We’re going to be found absolutely clean.”Analysts said the SFC investigation would only add to the uncertainty surrounding Sands China and its parent Las Vegas Sands.Aaron Fischer, of CLSA, said: “There could be a negative earnings impact in the short term because some players might feel less comfortable gambling at the Sands properties.“But we don’t think over the long term there will be any serious impact like losing a licence.”Sands China is one of six casino groups licensed to operate in Macao, a former Portuguese colony that is now the world’s biggest gaming market.Competitors include MGM Resorts International and Wynn Macau, a unit of Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts.Besides Macao, Las Vegas Sands operates in the highly regulated markets of Nevada, Singapore and Pennsylvania.
90;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-03-02T23:01:11Z;Gambling group probe threatens to hurt Gingrich;;The investigation into Las Vegas Sands, a big US gambling company with operations in Macao, could cast a cloud over former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich’s expected announcement that he is exploring a presidential run.The Sands, which is headed by Sheldon Adelson, the conservative activist, is listed as the single largest donor to a non-profit organisation headed by Mr Gingrich and has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars more to other Republican candidates, according to federal records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.On Tuesday, the company announced it had received a subpoena from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its compliance with anti-bribery laws and that the Department of Justice, which examines potential criminal allegations, was conducting a similar investigation.Mr Gingrich’s organisation, called American Solutions for Winning the Future, has received $6.5m from Sands since the 2006 election cycle. The Center for Responsive Politics said the funds might have been from the organisation, individual members or employees. One person familiar with the matter said the donations came from Mr Adelson, a longtime supporter of Mr Gingrich, and not corporate funds.American Solutions, which is known in Washington as a 527 group – Mr Gingrich also runs a political action committee with the same name – spent $12.9m on fundraising activities in the 2010 election and $3.2m to pay for private chartered aircraft for Mr Gingrich and others.The former Republican Speaker was expected to become the first in a long list of potential Republican candidates to announce his interest in a possible run for president on Thursday, although his aides suggested the announcement could be delayed. Fox News, the conservative news channel, announced on Wednesday that it was suspending its contract with Mr Gingrich in light of the expected news.The former Georgia congressman is regarded as a champion of conservatism among many activists for his role in leading the Republican takeover of the House in 1994 and his opposition to then-president Bill Clinton.Mr Adelson made an appearance at a two-day planning meeting Mr Gingrich held in Washington in January to discuss the creation of a exploratory committee, the first step politicians take when they are considering a run for president. Mr Adelson is also a big supporter of Eric Cantor, the current Republican majority leader in the House.Mr Gingrich’s office did not reply to several requests for comment on his ties to Mr Adelson or the Sands.A Sands spokesman said: “Mr Adelson doesn’t comment on his political contributions or political endorsements.”The company said it believed the probe was related to allegations contained in a Nevada lawsuit against the company by a former employee who ran the company’s Macao operations, Steven Jacobs, who has been called “disgruntled” by Sands.The company denies allegations in the lawsuit and said it was co-operating with authorities.Mr Jacobs claims in the lawsuit that Mr Adelson, whom he calls “mercurial” and “notoriously bellicose”, demanded, among other allegations, that he use “improper leverage” against senior government officials in Macao in order to obtain permits to sell certain ­properties.He said Mr Adelson also directed him to threaten to withhold Sands China business from prominent Chinese banks unless they used their influence over senior government officials for such permits. Mr Adelson allegedly threatened to fire Mr Jacobs if he refused and, ultimately, the executive’s job was terminated.Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and Washington lawyer said he did not expect the SEC and DoJ investigations to have implications for Mr Gingrich.“Obviously, if it turns out that Mr. Adelson is personally involved in any potentially illegal acts, there will be public pressure on Gingrich to renounce his fundraising assistance and return any funds he has raised or given,” Mr Potter said. “But that is only a potential development at this point.”Additional reporting by Rahul Jacob
91;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-03-02T21:36:48Z;US stocks rebound in late trading;;"Shares in Yahoo rose following unconfirmed reports that the internet search company was in talks to sell or trade its stake in Yahoo Japan, while the broad market rebounded from mid-session losses to close modestly firmer.Yahoo might be looking to exchange its 35 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan and give the majority owner Softbank a stake in the US company, according to a report in the Financial Times citing people familiar with the discussions.Any negotiations however, according to sources, were in the formative stages and the talks could still go nowhere. Yahoo rose 3.3 per cent to $16.63, one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500.Softbank, which holds a 41 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan, on Wednesday said there was “no truth” to the media reports. Yahoo declined to comment.Other technology stocks were also in focus. Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales after Intel, gained 3.3 per cent to $36.14 as JPMorgan raised its recommendation on the shares to “overweight” from “neutral”.Another semiconductor company, Xilinx, rallied 5.6 per cent to $34.54 while Altera gained 3 per cent to $42.46. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 1.4 per cent while the S&P technology index rose 0.5 per cent, the strongest gainer along with energy of all 10 major S&P indices.That helped stem losses on the S&P 500, which closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,308.44, trimming some of its 1.6 per cent loss in the previous session.The index is still off 2.6 per cent from its mid-February high, because of fears that sustained high oil prices due to political instability in north Africa and the Middle East may
hamper economic growth.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.1 per cent to 12,066.80 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4 per cent to 2,748.07.Sentiment was lifted somewhat by the ADP national employment report which suggested that job creation had been strong in February. The report estimated that private non-farm payroll employment had risen by 217,000 last month, ahead of the 180,000 expected by economists.This was a positive leading indicator for the official non-farm payroll figures which will come out on Friday, although the ADP number is not always a successful predictor of these widely watched numbers.“ADP has not exactly covered itself in glory recently in terms of accuracy versus the government data, so we don’t look for any change to the published median forecast of 193,000 for total non-farm payrolls and 200,000 for private payrolls,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Worries over oil prices, which edged up in the session, continued to weigh on sentiment in the wider markets.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in the previous session that higher oil prices were “a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability”.Some economists appeared more worried about the inflationary risk of the higher oil price than the chance of it damaging growth. “I think fears are overblown of a sharp oil-related downturn in global growth. I worry more about the inflationary consequences,” said Joachim Fels, co-head of Morgan Stanley’s global economics team.Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company which fell 6.3 per cent in the previous session after announcing in its annual report that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, bounced back slightly, rising 1.2 per cent to $44.24.Some analysts suggested that this might be an opportunity to buy the stock. “We believe this news will have limited fallout given the huge successes that LVS has had in Macau and Singapore and its ability to execute on a true integrated resort,” Citigroup said.Costco Wholesale reported a 16 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings but this failed to impress investors. The stock fell 2.5 per cent to $71.76.Elsewhere in the sector, BJ’s Wholesale Club, a membership-only warehouse retail store, reported an 81 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profits on charges related to store closures. But the company also reported that same-store sales had risen by 5.5 per cent. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $49.66.Apple was in focus as it unveiled the second edition of the iPad. Shares rose 0.8 per cent to $352.12."
92;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-03-02T19:15:30Z;First ETF for corporate bank loans;First ETF for corporate bank loans begins trading;The first exchange-traded fund for corporate bank loans begins to trade on Thursday amid demand from investors for interest rate hedges.With official interest rates near zero and the US economy picking up, these loans have been in demand recently because they pay a floating rate based on the London interbank offered rate.In the US, banks arrange such loans for companies with ratings below investment grade and syndicate a large tranche to investors. During the past 20 years, the market in these loans has grown from a niche area to a more widely held investment.“As the asset class has matured in terms of being a mainstream allocation, there has been the growing desire to offer an indexed product,” said Greg Stoeckle, head of bank loan business at Invesco, whose unit, Invesco PowerShares Capital Management, will manage the ETF.The ETF is based on the S&P/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 Index, a basket of the 100 largest and most liquid loans from borrowers including Bausch & Lomb, CIT, Ford Motor and the Las Vegas Sands casino.Using historical data, it shows an average annual return of about 6.9 per cent from 2002 to 2010.Retail investors have poured cash into mutual funds that buy these loans, leading to inflows of nearly $15bn in 34 consecutive weeks, boosting the assets managed to $37bn, according to Lipper, the fund tracker.Several fund companies have lined up to launch new loan products.Apollo Global Management last week launched a closed-end fund, which has a limited number of shares and trades on an exchange, for senior floating rate loans.The investor interest may bode well for future leveraged buy-outs, which are financed by these loans. The loans are senior to bonds in the capital structure of companies.In the buy-out boom years before the financial crisis, demand in the leveraged loan market was dominated by collateralised loan obligations, financial vehicles that allowed banks to repackage into securities pools of loans lent to risky companies. There have been relatively few new CLOs since the financial crisis.Timothy Strauts, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, said illiquidity in the loan market posed “some concerns” for the ETF.ETFs based on more illiquid markets tend to track their indices less closely than more liquid markets such as equities because buying and selling the underlying assets could be more difficult, particularly in periods of big market movements, Mr Strauts said.
93;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-03-02T05:45:52Z;Sands China shares hit by SEC probe of parent;;Shares of Sands China fell sharply in Hong Kong on news that Las Vegas Sands, the casino operator that is its main shareholder, was being investigated by the US regulator over its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribing foreign officials.The investigation is connected to a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by Steven Jacobs, the former chief executive of Sands China, which oversees LVS investments in Macao. The stock fell as much as 9.7 per cent to HK$17.20 on Wednesday morning.LVS has led the development of Macao as a global gaming destination, and it owns the Venetian casino in Las Vegas as well as the Sands Macau. It revealed in its annual report that it had received a subpoena from the SEC on February 9.The news also hit LVS shares, which fell more than 5 per cent in afternoon trading in the US.The US Department of Justice was conducting a probe alongside the SEC, the company said in the report, adding that it would co-operate with the investigations, which a company spokesman categorised as “fact finding inquiries”.Mr Jacobs alleged in a Nevada court filing that he was fired “without cause” in the summer, after resisting “repeated and outrageous demands” to “use improper ‘leverage’ against senior government officials of Macao”.Mr Jacobs also alleged he was asked to “refrain from disclosing truthful and material information” to the Sands China board, “so that it could decide if such information relating to material financial events, corporate governance, and corporate independence should be disclosed … to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange”.The issues that Mr Jacobs alleges he was asked to withhold included information about Triad criminal gangs, which are active in Macao.In a response, LVS said Mr Jacobs was a “disgruntled former executive”, while a termination letter sent to the executive last summer stated that he had exceeded his authority and failed to keep the board of Sands China notified of important decisions.This included failing to notify executives in Las Vegas that he had signed an agreement with Playboy to open a club at the Sands Macao and for starting unauthorised negotiations with potential partners, including the Four Seasons hotel group and Caesars Entertainment.On January 21, the Venetian Macao filed a criminal complaint with the Macao public prosecutor against Mr Jacobs, in which it made allegations of defamation and extortion.The SEC investigation could have repercussions for LVS because the gaming industry is so tightly regulated, said Robin Farley, an analyst with UBS, in a research note.“Gaming operators are highly regulated and every regulating jurisdiction in which LVS operates – Nevada, Macao, Singapore and Pennsylvania – would likely have to consider the results of any SEC or DOJ investigation in their licensing of LVS,” she said.The SEC investigation into LVS comes as the group is in talks to expand in Europe by building an ambitious gaming, hotels and leisure project in Spain costing €10bn-€15bn ($13.6bn-$20.4bn).
94;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-03-01T22:42:07Z;US stocks fall after Bernanke remarks;;Fifth Third Bancorp led financial stocks lower as the bank was subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, while the wider markets lost ground after comments from Ben Bernanke, US Federal Reserve chairman.The Midwestern bank tumbled 4.5 per cent to $13.95, a 2½-month low, after announcing that it was under SEC investigation for how it accounted for, and reported, some of its commercial loans.The stock led the losses in the wider financial sector, which was down 2.2 per cent.Elsewhere, SunTrust Banks lost 2.5 per cent to $29.41 while BB&T fell 2.1 per cent to $27.02.That helped the S&P 500 fall 1.6 per cent to 1,306.33, erasing most of the 1.7 per cent gains added in the previous two sessions.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4 per cent to 12,058.02 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,737.41.The S&P index began the session higher but fell after Mr Bernanke’s testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. The Fed chairman said sustained higher oil prices “would represent a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability, particularly if they were to cause inflation expectations to become less well anchored”.He also gave no indication of any further measures to stimulate the economy, which some traders had been hoping for.Any positive sentiment was further dashed as oil prices spiked higher on concerns that the unrest sweeping across north Africa and the Middle East might spread to Saudi Arabia.In the first three trading sessions of last week, the S&P fell 2.8 per cent on similar concerns. These worries damped risk appetite in the US and around the world, causing material stocks to dive lower.Titanium Metals was down 6.2 per cent to $17.82 while AK Steel was 4.7 per cent lower at $15.23. The S&P materials sector was down 2.3 per cent.Consumer services stocks were also depressed by the higher oil price and comments by Mr Bernanke.Carnival, the world’s largest cruise ship operator, was down 6.1 per cent to $40.08 while Priceline.com, the online travel company, lost 1.9 per cent to $445.29.But promising economic data helped limit the losses on Wall Street.Figures from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US manufacturing sector had seen strong growth in February.The index rose from 60.8 in January to 61, which is the highest reading since 2004. A number over 50 on the index indicates that the sector is growing.In earnings news, AutoZone, a retailer of car parts, reported earnings up 20 per cent and same-store sales up by 7.1 per cent. The stock added 2.2 per cent to $263.52.But that failed to lift related stocks. O’Reilly Automotive was down 0.8 per cent to $55.15 while Advance Auto Parts was 0.1 per cent lower at $62.63.There were some signs that the tide might be turning for car part retailers, which have profited since the financial crisis on people’s reluctance to buy new cars.General Motors reported that its sales had jumped 46 per cent in February from the same period a year ago due, primarily to a rise in demand from retail customers.The Buick and Cadillac car brands reported sales up by 73 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively.GM shares were down 1.7 per cent to $32.95, however, as the sales figures failed to impress investors.Separately, Ford reported that its sales had risen 14 per cent. Its stock was 2.6 per cent lower at $14.66.Elsewhere, Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company, fell 6.3 per cent to $43.70 after reporting that it was being investigated by the SEC and the Department of Justice over its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Lorillard, which primarily makes menthol cigarettes, was up 1.6 per cent to $78.98 after the US Food and Drugs Agency said evidence was “insufficient” that smoking menthol cigarettes is riskier than normal cigarettes.Tower Group, the insurance provider, was down 12.6 per cent to $23.76 after its 2011 earnings view fell short of analyst estimates.Sonus Networks was up 33.3 per cent to $4.16 after the internet telecoms company reported fourth-quarter profit up 11 per cent and issued a revenue guidance that surpassed expectations.
95;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-02-22T20:07:06Z;Genting Singapore beats estimates;;Genting Singapore, the Malaysian group that last year opened Singapore’s first casino resort, beat analysts’ estimates with a net profit of S$657.2m (US$514m) for 2010 on revenues of S$1.4bn.Genting, which has yet to open some of the hotel and entertainment elements of its $4.7bn Resorts World at Sentosa development, could make a net profit of S$1.2bn for 2011, according to the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The analysts had forecast an average of S$624.3m for 2010.The group did not break out full-year figures for its Singapore resort, which accounts for the bulk of revenue since transfer of its UK casino interests to another arm of the parent Genting group in August.Genting Singapore said the property contributed S$775.2m of S$788.5m of revenues in the fourth quarter, with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of S$389.8m.Genting’s results were in line with strong figures released earlier this month for the Marina Bay Sands, a $5.5bn casino resort opened in April by Las Vegas Sands.LVS said its MBS property generated $305.8m in ebitda on revenues of $560.4m during the fourth quarter, above analysts’ estimates and implying ebitda in a full year of about $1.2bn, without further growth.Sheldon Adelson, LVS chairman, said in Singapore last week that the business was still accelerating.Singapore’s two casino resorts opened last year after a ban was lifted to boost tourism revenue and transform the city-state’s image, described as “unexciting” by Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister.
96;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-02-17T19:06:54Z;LVS aims for ‘mini Las Vegas Strip’ in Spain;;Las Vegas Sands, the US casino resort operator, is in talks to build a gaming, hotels and leisure project in Spain costing €10bn-€15bn ($13.6bn-$20.4bn), according to Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief executive.Mr Adelson added that the group had rejected government requests to build a casino in Vietnam.He indicated that its newly opened Marina Bay Sands property in Singapore might make pre-tax profits of $2bn in 2012, up from a forecast $1.25bn-$1.5bn in 2011.He dismissed speculation that LVS might make an initial public offering for MBS in Singapore or Hong Kong. There was “no way”, he said, that an IPO could succeed since poor liquidity on the two exchanges would discourage investment by fund managers and wealthy individuals.LVS was “very seriously considering” a project in Spain, which Mr Adelson said could be 10 times as big as the Singapore project, with up to 20,000 hotel rooms and millions of square feet of retail, exhibition and convention space.“I want to do a mini Las Vegas Strip in Europe,” he commented. “I hope we can use the name Euro Vegas.” The project would be LVS’s first in Europe, adding to casino resorts in Las Vegas, Pennsylvania, Singapore and Macao, the self-governing Chinese territory.Las Vegas has been considering the idea of Spanish investment for years. Mr Adelson visited Spain to examine the idea in 2008. In June last year he said he was looking at either Madrid or Barcelona.Mr Adelson confirmed on Thursday that he was in talks with the authorities in Barcelona and Madrid. He said he had also been in contact with Valencia and the Costa del Sol. However, he warned that LVS would seek major concessions on planning for the project, which he suggested could create 180,000 jobs.“No private-sector company [in this industry] has made investments of this kind and we need the support of the government,” he said, calling on ministers to establish a top-level support group and to provide for proposals to receive approval within 60 days.The project would provide a significant fillip for the Spanish economy, which has been battered by recession, unemployment and sovereign debt fears since the global financial crisis.“Can you imagine having 10 Marina Bay Sands in a strip,” he said, referring to the US$5.5bn Singapore resort, opened last year.
97;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-02-04T21:48:47Z;Wall St shrugs off weak jobs data;;Wall Street edged higher led by tech stocks as investors shrugged off weak January employment data.The S&P technology index was up 1.1 per cent to 472.98 headed by JDS Uniphase after the company posted forecast-beating second-quarter earnings.The maker of communications equipment for telecom and cable companies was up 29.9 per cent to $22.75 after reporting revenues up 38 per cent and earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations.Related technology stocks were lifted by the news. F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, was up 4.6 per cent to $123.64 while Juniper Networks, the world’s second-biggest maker of data networking equipment gained 4.1 per cent to $40.06.But the key event concerning the markets was the January non-farm payroll figures, which showed that only 36,000 new jobs had been created last month. Economists had expected 136,000.Traders were left unsure which way to turn for much of the day, however, after the data also showed that the unemployment rate had fallen to its lowest level since April 2009. Unemployment was expected to rise slightly, but instead fell to 9 per cent from 9.4 per cent. This was partly caused by a fall in the size of the labour force, however. Many commentators were quick to point out that the headline 36,000 figure was not as bad as it seemed as the adverse weather conditions during the sampling week would have skewed the data.Ira Jersey, a US interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse, said: “The results were not as bad as they seemed. At best, the results were expected and at worse they were a little below consensus,” Mr Jersey said.Equities were in negative territory for much of the day, but rallied in late trade as investors finally concluded that the data was an aberration. “We discounted today’s headline employment figure because of the poor weather during the sampling week,” said Bob Baur chief global economist at Principal Global Investors.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,310.87, helping the index gain 1.9 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to close at 12,092.15, the first time the index has ended a week above 12,000 since June 13, 2008. The index was up 1.7 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent in the session to 2,769.30, a rise of 2.6 per cent over the past five days.Also preventing the markets from losing ground over the employment numbers on Friday was the fact that the whole week had seen promising economic data. The ADP employment survey on Wednesday estimated that 187,000 non-farm private jobs were added in January. Figures from the Labor Department on Thursday showed job increases last month, and other reports showed strong manufacturing and service sector growth in the US economy.In other earnings news Las Vegas Sands posted disappointing fourth-quarter results, sending shares in casino stocks lower. The global casino group saw profit and revenue jump in the quarter, helped by growth in its Macao and Singapore operations, but investors had hoped for greater revenues and so the shares tumbled 8.5 per cent to $46.03.This weighed on related stocks. Wynn Resorts, another US casino operator, was down 1.1 per cent to $118.06 while MGM Resorts was 2.2 per cent lower at $14.81.Elsewhere, Power One, which makes power converters, were down 21.2 per cent to $9.26 after giving a weak first-quarter revenue outlook. This came despite the company posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.Coinstar, the vending machine and DVD rental kiosk operator, was down 11.9 per cent to $38.96 after saying that its first-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street’s expectations.The week on Wall Street began with a rebound following the sharp 1.8 per cent losses seen at the end of the previous week.This was helped on Monday by near record quarterly profits from Exxon-Mobil and news on Tuesday that Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, reported a threefold rise in quarterly profits. ExxonMobil was up 3.2 per cent to $83.28 over the week while Pfizer added 5.9 per cent to $19.30.Strong economic data also lifted sentiment. Solid data on consumer spending, manufacturing and employment gave investors cause to be hopeful about the pace of the US recovery.After healthy gains on Monday and Tuesday, however, Wall Street stalled.The S&P kept just above the 1,300 mark while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just above 12,000.
98;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-01-25T23:17:56Z;Republican donor trail offers 2012 clues;;A long list of possible Republican presidential candidates have been busy raising millions of dollars over the past two years, although not a single one has officially thrown his – or her – hat in the ring.Campaign finance experts say it is unusual that, even at this early stage of the 2012 presidential contest, Republican candidates have not yet begun to organise campaign committees or raise funds formally at the level necessary to win the Republican nomination to take on Barack Obama.But a review of federal campaign data shows the potential candidates were able to raise a substantial amount of money to promote themselves and back other Republican candidates’ political campaigns.While these funds may not be used for a presidential campaign – a candidate must officially announce their intention to run and create a separate committee for that purpose – the contributions donated to the candidates from 2009 to 2010 offer a picture of the kinds of donors lining up for what is likely to be a tough Republican primary contest.The former Republican speaker of the House, who will announce whether he is running for president in April, has proved to be one of the most adept fundraisers so far. A tax-exempt issue advocacy group chaired by Mr Gingrich, called American Solutions for Winning the Future, raised – and spent – about $24.4m from 2009 to October 2010, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Leading contributors include big coal interests such as Peabody Energy and Arch Coal, a group that is at loggerheads with the Obama administration over a permit that was revoked by environmental regulators.Other big donors include Las Vegas Sands, which gave the group $500,000. It is unclear if the donation came from executives or the company, a resort and gaming group that generates most of its revenue from casinos in Macao and Singapore. Crow Holdings, a Texas-based real estate investment group, gave $350,000.American Solutions, which is advocating a campaign to end the Obama healthcare reforms, has spent $11.7m to create a direct mail fundraising network.According to tax records, American Solutions also paid out $235,000 in “small loans” to a holding company controlled by Mr Gingrich in 2009. A spokesman for the group said it was repaying a loan Gingrich Holdings had made to the political organisation a year earlier “as a precaution to make sure it had cash flow”.Mr Gingrich and his associates have also spent $2.2m in private chartered jet travel since 2009. The former speaker’s political action committee raised more than $700,000, and donated $125,700 to Republican candidates and other political action committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Ms Palin has proved to be a Republican kingmaker over the past two years, which could give her a boost among influential Tea Party lawmakers.SarahPac, her political action committee, raised $5.4m over the past two years, with about $500,000 going mostly to Tea Party candidates.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, most of the money flowing into SarahPac comes from individuals who work for single-cause organisations, people working in finance or retirees. SarahPac spent more than $1.4m on political and media consultants and fundraising over the past two years.The former Arkansas governor has raised more than $1.7m since 2009, mostly from retirees and healthcare professionals, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Donors who have given $10,000 include a theatre group called Celebrity Attractionsand a Memphis gastroenterology group.Ask any Republican on Wall Street and they will tell you that Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who lost the Republican primary against John McCain in 2008, is a natural fundraiser.The former Bain executive raised $8.8m through his political action committee over the last election cycle, with much of the funds coming from the financial industry.Individuals working for Goldman Sachs donated nearly $200,000 to Mr Romney in the 2010 election cycle, followed by $88,500 from those working for Bain, the private equity group, and $40,500 from people living in a huge Florida retirement community known as The Villages.About $1.1m has been directed to Republican candidates.The Pac has spent more than $2m on campaign and fundraising expenses.The former Minnesota governor emerged on the national scene as a potential running-mate for Republican nominee John McCain in 2008. Since then, he has raised $3.3m with the help of corporate donations from Comcast, Enterprise-Rent-A-Car, Target and AT&T and a handful of $10,000 donations from wealthy individuals and retirees.The Florida senator is not considered a presidential contender, but he is almost universally regarded as a likely candidate for vice-president. Mr Rubio would be an attractive choice because he could attract Hispanic voters and is popular in Florida, a battleground state.His campaign to be senator proved he is a formidable fundraiser, having raised and spent $21m on his election. Fundraisers included employees at Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, and employees of Elliott Management, the New York hedge fund founded by Paul Singer.
99;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2011-01-16T20:47:54Z;Asia’s punt on gambling pays off handsomely;Five of the world’s top 10 gambling companies are based in Asia;Five of the world’s top 10 gambling companies are based in Asia, according to an annual review of the industry, underlying the increasing shift of gambling activity from west to east.While Sheldon Adelson’s US-based Las Vegas Sands tops the list compiled by Global Betting & Gaming Consultants, most of its revenues come from Asia.The next five places are all Asian operators – Genting Singapore, Sands China, which is 71 per cent owned by LVS, Wynn Macau, SJM Holdings and Kangwon Land.The rankings, based on market capitalisation adjusted for the percentage of gambling revenues, includes both land-based and online operators.Of the online operators, the software provider Playtech is ranked first, followed by betting exchange operator Betfair and the two businesses in the process of merging, Austria-based Bwin and UK-listed PartyGaming.But GBGC says the profits of the sector’s listed online companies comfortably surpass those of their privately held counterparts. The consultants estimate that the top five private online companies are four times more profitable than the top five listed online companies.An index compiled by GBGC which measures the state of the gambling industry since 2005 shows that after its dramatic decline in 2008 and signs of recovery in 2009, land-based gambling companies appear to be coming out of their dire economic straits of recent years, while the online industry has lost some of its value of the previous year as share prices have fallen.Asia’s strong presence in the rankings is a sign of the increasing significance of the Asian market compared with 2008 when only one Asian company figured in the top 10, says GBGC.While many gambling companies responded to the economic crisis by delisting, the Asian market witnessed the emergence of Wynn Macau and Sands China, spun off from their parent companies and established as listed companies in 2009.Warwick Bartlett of GBGC says the turnround at Las Vegas Sands from its flirtation with bankruptcy during the economic crisis is mostly due to Mr Adelson’s $1bn cash injection and success of its Macau and Singapore operations.Its shares, which sank to $1.38 in 2009, were above $47 on Friday. The company, operator of the Venetian and the Palazzo in Las Vegas, has a market capitalisation of $32.3bn.SJM Holdings, founded by Stanley Ho and the biggest casino operator in Macao, entered the list at number five after a 182 per cent rise in its share price in 2010.Mr Bartlett said: “The movement within the index reflects the changes in the global economy. Asia has recognised gambling is GDP positive and new casinos in Singapore are expected to add 2 per cent to their GDP in a few years.”The rise in the importance of Asia contrasts with the declining influence of the UK, Mr Bartlett added. Eight years ago, William Hill was ranked seventh and Rank Group ninth. This year there is no UK operator in the top 20.
100;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2010-11-02T17:19:30Z;Las Vegas Sands has much riding on Asian gaming;The multibillion-dollar bet on gambling in Singapore and Macao looks good, says Kevin Brown;As befits the head of one of the world’s biggest casino operators, Sheldon Adelson likes a punt. Last year, the chief executive of Las Vegas Sands placed a multibillion-dollar treble on the future of Asian gaming. With two legs completed, the bet is looking good. But Mr Adelson may yet stumble before the finish line.Las Vegas Sands spotted the potential of Asian gambling nearly a decade ago, when the former Portuguese territory of Macao, now a special administrative region of China, opened its centuries-old gaming market to foreign companies.By 2008, Las Vegas Sands had two casino resorts operating in the territory – the only location in China where gaming is legal. But the company had loaded up on debt to pay for the building spree. When revenues collapsed during the global financial crisis it was briefly in danger of going bankrupt.In the first leg of his treble, Mr Adelson poured in $1bn of his own cash to stabilise the company’s finances. The gamble paid off. Talk of bankruptcy receded, and the company bought time for a $2.1bn share sale in the US and the $2.5bn Hong Kong listing of Sands China, which runs the Macao casinos. The second leg was Mr Adelson’s decision to press on with the $5.5bn Marina Bay Sands casino resort in Singapore, one of two casino projects approved by the island state in 2005. It was a brave call. Many thought Singapore too small to support two casinos, arguing that if they succeeded it would only be by diverting Chinese customers from Macao, effectively cannibalising the company’s revenues there. To cap it all, the complex was delayed by engineering problems and came in 50 per cent over the original $3.6bn budget.Last week, that gamble paid off too. In its third-quarter results announcement, which included the first full quarter of operations at Marina Bay Sands, LVS said the Singapore property had generated the highest quarterly adjusted earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation of any property in the company’s history. It also had the highest margins, on the same basis. LVS shares surged 10 per cent to $45.25 after the announcement, up from a low of $1.38 in March last year. Not surprisingly, Mr Adelson said he was “incredibly pleased” by the outcome.More importantly, the result looks likely to be sustainable. First, there is no discernible cannibalisation of Macao income. Total gaming revenues have continued to soar in the Chinese territory, hitting 18.87bn patacas ($2.36bn) in October, up 50 per cent on the equivalent month a year earlier. Revenues for the year to date are up 59 per cent to 152.1bn patacas, according to Macao’s gaming bureau. Second, there appears to be plenty of business for both casinos. Resorts World Sentosa, the second Singapore resort, has yet to report third-quarter figures. But it opened earlier than Marina Bay Sands and completed its first full quarter in June, with similar results. Genting Singapore, the Malaysian-owned operating company, said its second-quarter net profit of S$396.5m ($308m) was “attributed mainly” to the Sentosa resort.It is the third leg of the bet, however, that could lead to trouble. Having stabilised the company, Mr Adelson has restarted work on a $4.1bn casino resort project close to its existing Venetian resort in the Cotai Strip area of Macao. The latest project includes Shangri-La, Traders and Sheraton hotels with more than 6,000 rooms, as well as a third casino. It is expected to open in two phases by the end of next year, with a third phase, including another hotel, to be added later.The risk is twofold. First, even the gaming starved inhabitants of mainland China may not have an inexhaustible appetite for losing their money in Macao’s casinos. LVS is not the only operator after their cash – others have ambitious building plans too. Even if demand holds up, Beijing has moved in the past to limit mainland residents’ access to the special administrative region, and may do so again, for unpredictable reasons.Secondly, LVS is having trouble getting the buildings off the ground – literally – because of restrictions on the use of foreign workers. A labour shortage has already prompted a three-month delay in the projected completion date of the first phase. More delays are possible, with potentially serious consequences for LVS’s long-term growth.Investors don’t seem to care, though. LVS closed at $47.23 on Monday, the highest since August 2008. Sands China closed at HK$17.10, up 95 per cent over 12 months. In part, this reflects the success in Singapore and the potential rewards from Cotai: analysts are forecasting earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of up to $800m a year from the latest project. With Mr Adelson’s record, though, it might just be that old gambler’s mantra: when you’re on a roll, just keep betting.Kevin Brown is the FT’s Asia Regional Correspondentkevin.brown@ft.com

Analysts at FBR Capital Markets said they preferred large banks to the regionals but cast doubt on the long-term prospects for financials.The analysts said that, in the short term, banks were benefiting from releasing reserves because of improving credit quality.But they added that this benefit could wane before longer term organic revenue drivers, such as higher interest rates and a growth in loans, return.Banks also started to head lower after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that regulators are probing the sector’s mortgage foreclosure practices. Bank of America lost 2.5 per cent to $11.16 and Wells Fargo declined 1.5 per cent to $25.72.Citigroup was the main bright spot in financials, rising 2.4 per cent to $4.21 after Richard Ramsden, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, added the bank to his “conviction buy” list. He raised Citigroup’s price target to $5.50, saying that the shares could rise as much as 34 per cent in the next 12 months.Invesco, the investment management company, fell 0.9 per cent to $22.11 even though profits rose 47 per cent, helped by its acquisition of Morgan Stanley’s mutual fund business in June.CommScope, the communications cable maker, said it is in takeover talks with The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. The potential deal would be worth $31.50 per share in cash or $2.98bn. CommScope surged 30.5 per cent to $30.16.

The sector is the best-performing over the past six months, up 12 per cent.“It seems very 1950s-ish today, but with all the instability in the economy, and low rates, people are looking once again for some yield and some stability,” said Kenneth Polcari, a New York Stock Exchange trader and managing director at ICAP.The New York Times Company surged 7.1 per cent to $8.59 a share. The newspaper group is expected to post rebounding advertising sales in its third quarter earnings.Traders said that the group’s sharp move the result of its price crossing 50-day moving average, triggering large buy orders on the stock.Natural gas group Chesapeake rose 1.1 per cent to $23.30 after Cnooc, the Chinese energy producer, agreed to buy a one-third stake in Chesapeake’s Eagle Ford gas shale for $1.1bn. It would be the largest purchase of a US energy asset by a Chinese company.By close, the S&P 500 index was flat at 1,165.04, as was the Nasdaq Composite index at 2,402.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held firm at 11,008.59.Volumes were low, however, as other US markets and many trading floors were closed for the Columbus day holiday.JPMorgan Chase added 1.1 per cent to $39.73 ahead of its earnings announcement on Wednesday.“We expect bank stocks can outperform in the near term as we see our banks either meeting or exceeding Q3 estimates,” said analysts at Citigroup, calling JPMorgan “a potential positive catalyst for the group” with strong core investment banking revenues.Intel, which reports earnings on Tuesday, added 0.2 per cent to $19.56 a share, as analysts expect it to top its previous quarter’s revenues. Google, reporting on Thursday, added 0.5 per cent to $538.84 a share. It is expected to top second quarter earnings.“The S&P 500 continues to outgrow the US economy, led by foreign exposure,” said David Bianco, chief equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.A rise in the dollar after hit industrial groups, who benefit from a weaker greenback that makes their products attractive to emerging markets.Du Pont fell 1.2 per cent to $46.09 and 3M fell 1.1 per cent to $88.25. GE dropped 0.9 per cent to $16.96.Airgas rose after it said that it will appeal a court ruling allowing insurgent board members, who are trying to engineer a $5.5bn takeover by its industrial gas rival Air Products, to bring forward its 2011 annual meeting to January.Shares added 2.8 per cent to $69.78 as expectations of the merger rose.Another surge in corn and grain prices lifted Monsanto, which sells seeds, adding 0.7 per cent to $51.23 a share. The shares have risen nearly 10 per cent over the past five sessions as shortages and demand for hard assets by investors drive up feedstock prices.Archer Daniels Midland, however, which buys grains to process into other products, saw shares drop 0.8 per cent to $32.59. Analysts at Deutsche Bank also downgraded it from “buy” to “hold”.Clothing retailer JC Penney added 1.9 per cent to $33.12. Vornado, the commercial real estate investment group, revealed that it had bought a 9.9 per cent stake in the retailer. Last week, hedge fund Pershing Square said it had bought 17 per cent of the company.Shares of gambling groups Las Vegas Sands, up 3.5 per cent to $38.62, and Wynn Resorts, up 8.5 per cent to $101.78, rose on hopes for their expansions in the Macau resort.We have “expectations of a strong sequential growth story in Singapore and the positive long-term trajectory of Macau”, said analysts at Morgan Stanley.
103;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2010-09-29T08:59:31Z;Macao tries to cool housing market;;Macao has unveiled measures to cool its property market amid concerns that low interest rates and strong Chinese demand are fuelling a bubble, following similar recent moves by Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and mainland China.The government said it would increase land supply, tighten mortgage lending rules and increase transaction costs in an effort to take the steam out of speculative activity.Once a sleepy gambling backwater, Macao has been growing at a breakneck rate since the beginning of this decade. The economy took off after it liberalised the gaming market and brought in more casino operators, including Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and Melco Crown Entertainment. The city overtook Las Vegas as the world’s biggest gaming market in 2006.While gaming revenue rose rapidly, however, so did house prices. Residential property prices in Macao have increased almost a third since the end of 2008, according to KB Wong, director of valuation and advisory services at DTZ, the property consultancy.Macao’s tightening measures come as other Asian countries move to curb the rise in house prices. In China, premier Wen Jiabao this month called on local governments to take part in a drive to discourage speculation and said that limiting price increases was central to maintaining social stability.On Wednesday, Singapore’s Straits Times reported that several banks in the city state had seen a drop in home loans applications after the government moved to cool its market for the third time in a year a month earlier.Hong Kong last month also raised minimum deposits for luxury properties and released additional land for development following price rises of about 40 per cent since the end of 2008. Australia in April reinstated a range of measures to restrict foreign investment in residential property following months of complaints that foreigners were pushing up prices.Like Hong Kong, the luxury property market in Macao has also seen much stronger growth, thanks to heavy buying interest from mainland Chinese and Hong Kong investors. The higher-end of the market, Mr Wong said, had risen as much as 40 per cent in the past three years.“The biggest problem in Macao is prices are now so high that ordinary people cannot afford to buy,” said Mr Wong.According to government data, the median monthly income in Macao was about MOP8,500 ($1,064) in the second quarter of this year, the same level as it was in the last quarter of 2008.To curb foreign buying, the government said non-Macao residents would need to put down a 30 per cent deposit for flats costing less than MOP3.3m, compared with a 10 per cent requirement for Macanese. Down-payments for flats above that value will be 30 per cent regardless of the buyers’ nationality.
104;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2010-09-16T02:59:28Z;Melco splashes $250m on promotion;;Melco Crown Entertainment, one of Macao’s casino operators controlled by the son of tycoon Stanley Ho, is hoping a new $250m dance and music stage show to promote its brand in mainland China.Advertisements for gambling are banned in China, the Macao casinos’ biggest market, accounting for more than half of all visitors to Macao.Lawrence Ho, Melco chief executive, said on Wednesday that an increasing number of Chinese visitors had been patronising Melco’s City of Dreams, which is staging the extravaganza, House of Dancing Water, since the company started marketing it on the mainland.“Macao is a supply-driven market,” Mr Ho said in an interview.The cost of the show – comparable to the budget of a top Hollywood movie – is believed to make it one of the most expensive productions staged indoors.It is based on a run-of-the-mill, Disney-inspired plot, but is acted out on an extravagant stage featuring a 3.7m-gallon pool with more than five times the volume of an Olympic-sized pool, 11 large lifts and 18m high fountains.While mainland China accounts for more than half of all visitors to Macao, gaming companies are not allowed to advertise their casinos there, where gambling is illegal.Some Macao companies have in the past tried to promote their brands in China without highlighting the gambling aspect, but were not successful.In 2007, Melco launched an advertising campaign for a Macao hotel with gambling facilities that featured Chow Yun-fat, the Hong Kong actor best known for his role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but it was banned within three days, according to Mr Ho.The Venetian, Melco’s rival run by Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, does not advertise in China.Two years ago, it launched Zaia, a Cirque du Soleil show that can accommodate 1,800 spectators, compared with the 2,000 seats offered by the House of Dancing Water. Instead of direct advertising, it promotes its brand on the mainland by giving away free tickets to newspaper readers and arranging for media coverage.Mr Ho said his company’s new show, created by former Cirque du Soleil director Franco Dragone, would help Melco attract more visitors as Macao’s gaming market continues to grow.He expects total casino revenues to rise about 50 per cent this year to as much as $22bn in 2010, up from a record $14.9bn a year ago. Macao overtook Las Vegas as the world’s biggest casino market by revenue in 2006.Mr Ho also expects the show to help transform Macao from a day-tripper market to a multiple-day destination like Las Vegas.
105;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;A park and pool 200m above Singapore;;"When a man spends £3.7bn on a construction project, he is liable to expect it to open on time. So it was no surprise that Sheldon Adelson, chairman of Las Vegas Sands, one of the world’s biggest casino operators, sounded slightly vexed on June 23 when he formally opened the Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex in Singapore.The opening party was lavish – with 2,500 guests and a performance by Diana Ross – but it was six months late: the complex had been scheduled to open last December at a cost of £2.4bn. To make things worse, the company is already locked into an embarrassing legal dispute with a group of lawyers who held the resort’s first convention. They claim the air-conditioning didn’t work and the lavatories wouldn’t flush.After a night in the hotel, I can see why Adelson might be cross. The hotel boasts no fewer than five celebrity-chef restaurants, two of them – Santi and Guy Savoy – run by chefs whose original establishments each have three Michelin stars. But when I visited, the day after the opening, two were still being fitted out, as were two of the five bars, and four of the nine non-celebrity restaurants. The convention centre – a cool 1m sq ft – opened a couple of months ago, but neither of the two theatres is open, nor is the museum and art gallery. And while the shopping mall is taking money, with more than 300 shops promised – think Tiffany, Jimmy Choo and La Perla – many premises are yet to be occupied.Clearly, then, this is a work in progress. And yet all the signs are that Adelson has backed a big winner at Marina Bay, one of two so-called integrated resorts that are opening this year as part of a Singapore government plan to help the island shed its international image as a nanny state that jails people for chewing gum.According to Las Vegas Sands, visitor numbers have hit 25,000 a day, and a rise to 70,000 is forecast for next year when the resort is fully open. That translates to annual pre-tax profits of around £660m and a payback time of just five years or so. Singapore’s other new casino, opened in January on the offshore island of Sentosa by Genting, a Malaysian gaming and hotels group, is also doing well.The two resorts represent an astonishing policy change by Singapore’s government. Lee Kuan Yew, founding prime minster of the city state, was initially opposed to casinos because of the link he perceived between gambling and crime. His views were endorsed as recently as 2002 by Lee Hsien Loong, the present prime minister and Kuan Yew’s eldest son.But since then views have softened (though chewing gum is still hard to come by, nicotine or “therapeutic” chewing gum is permitted). Upmarket tourism has come to be seen as essential to Singapore’s continued economic growth as manufacturing, financial and port activities.Economic success or not, the cultural strains imposed by the new policy are clearly visible in the casino. Make sure you have your passport with you if you’re visiting: to avoid an S$100 (£48) entry charge levied on Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, you have to prove you’re a foreign visitor. The charge, supposedly to deter gambling addiction, was introduced as a gesture to local protesters.The high point of my stay – literally and emotionally – was the Skypark. I had been rather dismissive before I went up, jocularly likening the structure to a stranded boat, perched uncomfortably atop the three hotel towers by a freak incoming tide (it’s a comparison said to annoy Moshe Safdie, its architect).I take it all back though. The view from the top is more than worth the ascent: you see Singapore laid out below you like a board game, the bay framed by the towers of the business district, the nicely preserved colonial quarter and the extraordinary East Coast park, a green strip running for more 20km up to Changi airport.The Skypark platform is bigger than I expected – longer than the Eiffel Tower is tall, and greener than it looks in photographs, especially in the central section open only to hotel guests. Even from the public observation deck – it’s S$20 (£9.50) for an express lift to the top if you’re not a guest – you can see three countries: Singapore, of course, with the towers of Johor Bahru, capital of Malaysia’s Johor state, clearly visible across the narrow strip of water that divides the two countries, and Sumatra, the northern island of Indonesia, beckoning visitors from beyond the Strait of Malacca. And even if you don’t swim, you will find the Skypark’s infinity pool, which appears to overflow directly into the bay, 200m below, irresistible.The Marina Bay Sands has views that match just about any city-centre hotel in the world, and that is as true of the bedrooms as the Skypark. My room’s floor-to-ceiling window looked out across the bay to the business district. The room was nicely proportioned, with a sofa, coffee table and an enormous bathroom. It had the usual light wood and beige furnishings of the 21st-century hotel, but with the lights from the high rises flashing and sparkling through the window, who cares what colour the sofa is?I do have one complaint. Back in the room after visiting the casino, well-fed and mercifully free of casino losses, I decided to test the loo. It didn’t work. I thought briefly of a lawsuit, but decided to fix the flush instead. It’s not hard; you just reconnect the little hook on the plunger to the bottom of the lever on the lid. I may send Adelson a plumber’s bill, though.Doubles from S$359 (£171), www.marinabaysands.comKevin Brown is the FT’s Asia regional correspondent"

107;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Viva Macau downfall offers cautionary tale;Airline carrier contests loss of operating certificate;The sudden collapse of a budget airline in Macao has demonstrated that regulatory risk can still trump seemingly safe bets in the world’s largest gambling market.While most foreign investors have benefited handsomely from the Chinese special administrative region’s fivefold increase in gaming revenues since 2002 – which has in turn fuelled the local tourism and property markets – the decline and fall of Viva Macau offers a cautionary tale.Viva was controlled by MKW Capital Management, an international private equity fund, and counted among its investors the nephew and late brother of Edmund Ho, Macao’s first chief executive after the former Portuguese colony returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999.The start-up carrier operated under a sub-concession arrangement with Air Macau, which in effect allowed Viva to “piggy-back” off the licence of the Chinese state-owned incumbent. This pragmatic structure was first pioneered, with the Macao government’s blessing, in the gambling industry. The city’s three original casino licence holders – Galaxy Entertainment, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau and Wynn Resorts – were allowed to grant one sub-concession to a competitor.Las Vegas Sands, which runs the world’s two largest casinos in Macao, MGM Mirage and James Packer’s Crown group all owe their presence in the Chinese special administrative region to a derivative licence.Viva’s problems began in late March after a payment dispute with its long-standing fuel supplier, the Nam Kwong group, also controlled by the Chinese government. The airline said it was refused fuel despite having a positive credit balance with Nam Kwong.“Nam Kwong was the largest beneficiary of Viva’s business,” said one person familiar with the dispute. “Their decision to cut Viva off was beyond comprehension.” Viva and MKW, whose website notes “we succeed when our companies succeed”, declined to comment. Nam Kwong could not be reached for comment.With Viva forced to cancel flights and its passengers stranded, Macao’s government entered the fray. Citing “[the need] to protect Macao’s image as a tourism city”, the government announced on March 28 that it “had requested and obtained Air Macau’s consent to terminate its sub-concession contract with Macau”. On the same day, Macao’s Civil Aviation Authority revoked Viva’s air operator certificate.Viva is contesting the revocation in Macao’s courts, and has held talks with overseas airlines eager to establish a presence in the territory. Some executives say Viva’s fate highlights a dramatic change in local leadership styles after Mr Ho stepped down in December and was replaced by Fernando Chui, a former minister for social and cultural affairs.Though both hail from two of the territory’s richest families, Mr Ho was much more of a wheeler-dealer. “Everyone in Macao has got a story about calling Edmund with a proposal and hearing him say ‘Why not?’,” says one banker. “The new chief executive is a bureaucrat.”

In short, it could well be a game-changer”.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was 1.5 per cent lower at 1,110.86 – 6.4 per cent down since the start of the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.3 per cent to 10,379.60, leaving it 5.7 per cent lower on the week. The Nasdaq Composite had dropped 2.3 per cent to 2,265.64, down 7.9 per cent over the week.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility, was up 26 per cent on Friday to 41.32, and 87.4 per cent higher on the week.Technology stocks led the session’s slide on Friday. Chipmaker SanDisk fell 5.4 per cent to $37.61, Cisco lost 3.1 per cent to $24.71, Apple was down 4.2 per cent to $235.86 and Hewlett-Packard declined 3.3 per cent to $46.73.US-listed shares in Panasonic on Friday lost 2.1 per cent to $13.75 in spite of the Japan-based consumer electronics company forecasting its first annual profit in three years, lifted by stronger demand for plasma televisions.The week’s market volatility contributed to the postponement of several initial public offerings, including Americold Realty Trust’s $680m listing, which was expected to be the largest IPO in the US this year.AIG rose 5.3 per cent on Friday to $38.70 as the bailed-out insurer posted a profit for the third time in the past four quarters on lower writedowns and higher investment income.Net income in the quarter was $1.45bn compared with a loss of $4.35bn last year.Goldman Sachs rose 0.5 per cent to $142.99 on Friday on the day of its annual shareholder meeting.Lawyers acting for the bank are reported to have met the Securities and Exchange Commission to discuss a possible settlement of the fraud lawsuit the regulator filed against Goldman last month.The financial sector was lower on the week as Citigroup fell 8.5 per cent to $4, JPMorgan lost 4.3 per cent to $40.76 and Morgan Stanley slipped 8.2 per cent to $27.75.Mergers and acquisitions activity was weak. Continental Airlines fell 16.7 per cent to $18.61 over the week as the fourth-biggest US airline announced on Monday a merger with United Airlines’ parent UAL Corp, the third-biggest US airline, valued at $3bn. The deal will create the world’s biggest carrier by passenger traffic, which will retain United’s name. United fell 17.2 per cent to $17.89.Transocean the world’s largest offshore oil drilling contractor and owner of the BP-contracted oil rig leaking into the Gulf of Mexico, was down 6 per cent to $68.01 during the week.The stock was downgraded to “underperform” from “buy” on Friday by Crédit Agricole with a 12-month target price of $74 per share. US-listed shares in BP lost 5.9 per cent to $49.06 over the week.
109;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2010-05-03T18:17:10Z;One oligarch does not a geoeconomic trend make;;"The Russians are coming, aren’t they?UC Rusal’s controversial, but ultimately successful, Hong Kong listing was supposed to be the harbinger of an important new geoeconomic trend. If the heavily indebted aluminium group, controlled by oligarch Oleg Deripaska, could raise $2.2bn on the Chinese special administrative region’s stock exchange, surely other Russian resource companies would follow its lead?The story pitch went something along these lines: by listing in Hong Kong, Russian resource companies intent on tapping the China market could themselves claim to be part Chinese and share the wealth with Chinese shareholders.Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands, the American casino companies making money hand over fist in China’s other SAR, Macao, hailed a similar symbiosis when they listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange last year.More than three months on from Rusal’s Hong Kong debut, however, and local investors are still awaiting the much anticipated Russian invasion.Strikeforce Mining & Resources, which mines copper and molybdenum, is looking at a modest $200m Hong Kong IPO, people close to the deal confirmed on Monday.But SMR, too, is controlled by Mr Deripaska. What of Russia’s other oligarchs?Sergey Popov’s coal company, Suek, is reportedly setting its sites on a £2bn initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange, despite concerted lobbying from senior executives at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.One oligarch, in other words, does not a trend make. Until Mr Deripaska’s peers follow him to Hong Kong, talk of a brave new Sino-Russian financial axis will remain just that.Reading the futuresThe future, we all know, is in the stars. So it is appropriate that the multinational team of eggheads trying to predict bubbles in financial markets at Switzerland’s prestigious Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich should call itself the financial crisis “observatory”.On Monday, the number gazers revealed the results of their boldest experiment to date – a six-month exercise, inaugurated last November and concluded this month, to see whether their mind-boggling mathematical models had real predictive power regarding four widely different asset classes.From Brazil’s Bovespa equity index, a Merrill Lynch European corporate bond index, the gold spot price and, as of December, cotton futures, the mathematicians and economists put their algorithms to work identifying trends, based on a fundamental belief in their ability to detect underlying patterns.The aim was to test two key hypotheses: whether bubbles can be diagnosed in real time before they end; and whether the termination point can be predicted with a higher probability than just chance.The result, according to Didier Sornette, professor of entrepreneurial risks, was broadly positive. The modelling was judged – using layman’s language – to have scored a win for the equity index and the gold price, a draw in the case of cotton, and be subject to a replay for the bond index, because of special circumstances. Of course, mathematical modelling of complex financial markets is nothing new, even if the technological firepower being devoted to it is constantly evolving with spiralling computing power. Likewise, the models themselves are being steadily refined. Prof Sornette, previously at the University of California in Los Angeles, is a mathematician and physicist who also teaches earth sciences.Needless to say, a precise judgment about the success of the experiment depends profoundly on the definitions and on where the experimenters place their goalposts. Some might quibble about the precise meaning of “bubble”, others about the degree of statistical correlation sufficient to deem a prediction accurate.But “observatory” members argue that, in spite of such definitional differences, their findings break new ground. While myriad academics are researching market phenomena, Prof Sornette says most content themselves with proof of concept and looking to the past, rather than daring to make predictive forecasts, then publicly put to the test.Perhaps more relevant to mere mortals, much of the brainpower being applied to such subjects is taking place behind the very closed doors of hedge funds and the like. By contrast, the Zurich team is based at a university where the incentive and mission is to publish. Emboldened by their first findings, the Zurich stargazers are now broadening their work to seven more asset classes, before boldly going even further. Some may dismiss their efforts as more akin to astrology than astronomy, but hedge funds are apparently already keen to learn more about their methods.world.view@ft.com"
110;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2010-04-27T11:41:29Z;Singapore opens second casino resort;;Singapore’s second casino-focused leisure and convention resort opened on Tuesday, pitting Las Vegas Sands against Malaysia’s Genting group in a $10bn wager on gambling in the city state.The resorts have generated controversy because they have brought gaming to the socially conservative island state for the first time since independence from Malaysia in 1965.Singapore has imposed a charge of S$100 (US$73) a day or S$2,000 a year for residents to visit the tables as a way of calming vocal opposition to the casino developments from locals who fear a spread of gambling addiction and crime.The government is also encouraging people with a gambling problem to add themselves voluntarily to a national blacklist of people who will be refused entry to the casinos.However, analysts say the two resorts are likely to generate a flood of well-heeled overseas tourists, adding up to 1.6 percentage points to gross domestic product in a full year, according to official forecasts.The government wants to buttress the island state’s burgeoning financial and manufacturing sectors with tourism earnings of S$30bn in revenues by 2015 – triple today’s figure.The US$5.5bn Marina Bay Sands, a stunning development on the waterfront in the city’s business district, boasts a 1.2 hectare skypark, spanning three hotel towers and floating 220 metres above the pavement. The area is likely to become something of an architectural icon, even though the skypark bears a passing resemblance to a stranded boat.Sheldon Adelson, chief executive of Las Vegas Sands, confirmed on Tuesday that the company expected to recoup its investment within five years, with a Singaporean contribution of more than US$1bn a year to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Genting’s development, the US$4.7bn Resorts World at Sentosa, opened in February. It appears popular with punters, although no figures have been published.The resort, located on an offshore leisure island, will have four hotels when it is fully open, together with a Universal Studios theme park and the world’s largest oceanarium alongside the gaming tables.Singapore’s main rival for gaming tourists is Macao, the former Portuguese colony that is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Macao last year overtook Las Vegas as the world’s biggest gambling location by revenues.
111;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
112;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2010-04-21T00:40:51Z;Striving to play the perfect Macao game;;Steve Wynn raises the back of his shirt, revealing the scars from spinal surgery that has prevented him from visiting Macao since November.The five-month absence was the longest in eight years for the 68-year-old Las Vegas gaming mogul, who has visited the world’s biggest casino market on a monthly basis and returned this week to open his second Macao property.“We’re a Chinese company,” says Mr Wynn, whose Macao casino, which was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange last year, earns twice as much as its sister operations in Las Vegas.Mr Wynn welcomes recent government moves to cool the market in Macao, including a new limit on gaming tables. “We only added 24 tables or something,” he says of Encore, a new hotel and VIP gaming facility that opens this week. “This was about non-casino stuff. There’s enough gambling here.”At the end of last year there were 4,770 gaming tables in Macao, and the Chinese special administrative region said in March that it would cap the total at 5,500 until the end of 2012.The government is concerned that the local gaming market, which is now bigger than Las Vegas and Atlantic City combined, has been growing too rapidly. Despite the financial crisis, industry revenues expanded 10 per cent in 2009 to 119.4bn patacas ($15bn).“The government is very interested in slowing things down and seeing that [the industry develops] at a steady and safe rate,” Mr Wynn says. “You have to take it one step at a time. Some of the other [casino operators] thought they could gallop across the landscape. They were wrong.”Two of Mr Wynn’s rivals, Las Vegas Sands and Galaxy Entertainment, hope to complete large new integrated resort projects on Macao’s Cotai strip. Each has a planned capacity of 600 tables, which would appear to exceed the government’s announced cap.Wynn Macao is also in the final stages of negotiations for a new project on Cotai.Francis Lui, Galaxy deputy chairman, said on Tuesday that he was “very confident the government will give us a sufficient number of tables to allow us to open the [Cotai] project successfully,”Mr Wynn, whose Encore facility is his first new project since the Wynn Macao opened in September 2006, has taken a different approach in Macao to his archrival Sheldon Adelson, who controls Las Vegas Sands. The latter operates the world’s two largest casinos in Macao.“Sheldon Adelson has shown the courage of a lion in his commitment to bulking up the [Macao] tourist industry in terms of raw footage,” Mr Wynn says. “You can’t fault the Sands company for their commitment.”Mr Wynn, however, takes pride in his deliberate and perfectionist approach in Macao, where he has delayed casino openings that he did not feel were up to scratch.“We were laughing about our false starts [in Macao],” he says. “We built a whole casino, hired and trained the staff and got a certificate of occupancy …Then I took a look at it and cancelled the opening and ripped it out, re-did it and opened it up months later. I don’t know whether that makes us courageous or stupid – probably a little bit of both.”

Overall, earnings are likely to pleasantly surprise the markets.“The question is what happens after the earnings cycle. We are probably looking at seasonal weakness around the summer, where we could get a 5-10 per cent correction.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,211.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to 11,144.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,515.69.UPS added 5.3 per cent to $68.89 after the package delivery company, which is often regarded as a bellwether for the wider economy, reported better-than-expected quarterly results after the session’s close on Wednesday and raised its full-year earnings forecasts.Adjusted earnings were 71 cents a share, up from 52 cents last year and above consensus expectations of 57 cents.Revenue rose 7 per cent, helped by significant volume growth in international markets.Rival FedEx, the world’s largest cargo airline, was up 1.7 per cent to $95.62.Yum Brands rallied 2.6 per cent to $42.78 after reporting strong first-quarter results after the close of the session on Wednesday.The company, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and other restaurant chains, said profit in the quarter rose 11 per cent, boosted by strong sales in China and a Pizza Hut $10 pizza promotion.Shares in Citigroup pulled back 2.4 per cent to $4.81. For much of the session they bounced around the $5 mark – an important level for the stock because some investment funds are prohibited by their own charters from investing in sub-$5 stocks.Las Vegas Strip casino owner MGM Mirage dipped 5.5 per cent to $14.57 after posting a preliminary first-quarter loss of 22 cents a share and revenues of $1.46bn. Consensus expectations were for a loss of
21 cents a share.However, it was not clear whether the preliminary results and the estimates were comparable. Full results would be announced in the first week of May, MGM Mirage said.The company also said it would issue $750m in convertible debt.Rival Las Vegas Sands, a US casino operator that is focusing on expansion in Singapore and Macao, lost 1.2 per cent to $23.72.Mariner Energy, an oil and natural gas producer, jumped 42 per cent to $25.68 on news it is to be acquired by Apache Corp, the second-largest independent US oil producer by market capitalisation, for $2.7bn in cash and stock.Apache Corp was 1.3 per cent lower at $106.67.PPG Industries, a leading paint maker, rose 0.3 per cent to $69.73 after the company reported strongly better-than-expected quarterly results.Excluding non-recurring items, the earnings were 70 cents per share, compared with consensus expectations of 63 cents per share. Revenue increased 12.3 per cent.Google, the online search engine company, added 1.1 per cent to $595.30 ahead of its first-quarter earnings report to be released after the session’s close.Oklahoma-based oil and gas driller Helmerich & Payne rose 2 per cent to $40.74 on unconfirmed market speculation that Statoil, a Norwegian energy group, was planning to buy it for about $5.6bn.American Superconductor, a maker of electrical systems for wind farms and turbines, was up 9.7 per cent to $31.89 as the stock was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Deutsche Bank.

114;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;MGM Mirage’s ‘serious’ business in Macao;;Stanley Ho, the Chinese gaming tycoon, could not believe the proposal he received in the spring of 2002. “Are you serious,” he asked Philip Wang, an emissary sent by MGM Mirage to enquire about the tycoon’s interest in forming a Macao joint venture with the US gambling group.“We are very, very serious,” replied Mr Wang, a senior vice-president for MGM Mirage.“[The approach] was really a wild card,” he later told investigators from New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement. “At the time, we were very desperate.”MGM Mirage, controlled by Kirk Kerkorian, had finished fifth in the race for three new casino concessions in Macao, the Chinese special administrative region that is today the world’s biggest gaming market.One had gone to Mr Ho’s Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, the others to MGM Mirage’s US rivals, Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts.“We licked our wounds for a bit, and then tried to analyse whether there were any other opportunities for us to enter the Macao market,” Gary Jacobs, MGM Mirage’s former general counsel, told the DGE in a regulatory report completed in May 2009 but only released this week.MGM Mirage eventually formed a joint venture with Mr Ho’s daughter, Pansy, that gained entry to Macao after three more gaming concessions were approved by the government.The report, citing Mr Ho’s alleged association with Asian organised crime figures, recommended that Pansy Ho be declared an “unsuitable” partner and that MGM Mirage “disengage from any direct or indirect business or financial association with [her]”.But rather than heed New Jersey’s directive, MGM Mirage this week agreed to sell its 50 per cent interest in the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City and continue its partnership with Ms Ho.Ms Ho declined to comment on the New Jersey report. Mr Ho has consistently denied any connections with Macao or Hong Kong criminal gangs, or triads.“The DGE’s report acknowledges there is no evidence that Pansy Ho has engaged in any wrongdoing or been accused of any illegal activity,” Jim Murren, MGM Mirage chief executive, said in a statement.But the DGE’s report lays bare the company’s efforts to enter Macao and harshly criticises its due diligence procedures.The DGE also details Ms Ho’s financial dependence on her father. According to the report, Mr Ho established a special “Petunia Trust” on his daughter’s behalf, which she used to fund her investment in the joint venture with MGM Mirage.In addition, Ms Ho borrowed money from Goldman Sachs, HSBC and UBS.The patriarch’s largesse also extends to Ms Ho’s younger sister, Daisy, who the report says receives a monthly “allowance” of $25,000 from her father.This is in addition to the considerable salaries, expense accounts and share benefits both women enjoy as executives and directors at their father’s holding company, Sociedade de Turismo de Macau, and Hong Kong-listed conglomerate Shun Tak Holdings.The attempt to form a joint venture with Mr Ho foundered in 2003 when a regulator in Nevada, where MGM Mirage is based, warned that the state’s Gaming Control Board would not approve it.“Specifically, [the regulator] raised concerns about Stanley Ho’s alleged organised crime connections, issues involving loan sharking and debt collection at his Macao casinos, and Stanley Ho’s [negative] experiences with other casino regulatory agencies,” the report says.While there is no evidence that Mr Ho is personally connected to the Asian underworld, his casinos’ long-established practice of sub-contracting so-called “VIP rooms” to outside operators has given an unsavoury cast of characters entry to Macao’s gaming market.“You would have to be living under a rock not to know about Stanley Ho and what the [negative] perception of Stanley Ho is,” Terry Lanni, MGM Mirage’s former chairman and chief executive, told the DGE. “There was no way of clearing Stanley Ho in the eyes of regulators.”MGM Mirage therefore turned its attention to forming a 50-50 joint venture with Ms Ho, in the hope she would be seen as sufficiently independent from her controversial father.That was indeed the conclusion of regulators in Nevada, Illinois, Michigan and Mississippi, and the two partners opened the $1.25bn MGM Grand Macau in December 2007.Where other state regulators saw a daughter independent from her father, New Jersey saw a fig leaf and a catalogue of due diligence failings at MGM Mirage.The company, however, is unlikely to miss Atlantic City, where overall casino revenues were $260m in February – compared with $1.8bn in Macao.Additional reporting by Justine Lau.

US producer prices also rose faster than expected in January, partly because higher gas prices and cold weather boosted overall energy prices.Wall Street, however, shrugged off most of the negative sentiment surrounding the day’s news and closed up for the third consecutive session. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 1,106.75, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,392.90 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent to 2,241.71.However, S&P 500 futures fell around 7.8 per cent in extended hours in reaction to the Fed’s decision to raise the discount rate it charges banks for emergency loans to 0.75 per cent from 0.50 per cent.Walmart shares lost 1.1 per cent to $53.47 following disappointing fourth-quarter results. The world’s largest retailer by sales recorded comparable-store sales that trailed estimates. Mike Duke, Walmart chief executive, said he expected US sales to be “more challenging” in the first quarter.Some analysts questioned whether the disappointing figures showed that more consumers were trading up, citing Tuesday’s strong results from Whole Foods as evidence, or whether consumers were just spending less.The technology sector was also in focus following the release of a number of quarterly results.Hewlett-Packard gained 1.4 per cent to $50.81. Its first-quarter results, posted after the market’s close on Wednesday, comfortably beat estimates. The company also raised guidance for the year.Analysts said HP was well-placed to gain from an expected rise in technology spending as businesses replace ageing equipment.Rival Dell was set to report its latest results after the session’s close.

116;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2010-01-19T18:19:01Z;Nanny state aspires to racy resort image;;In the lobby of the Hard Rock Hotel, part of Singapore’s Resorts World Sentosa, a life-sized image of The Who’s guitarist Pete Townshend leaps through a window, brandishing an electric guitar. Around him, though, there is relative calm as hotel staff practise bar and reception work.Across town at the rival Marina Bay Sands, a 40-metre sculpture called Drift, by Antony Gormley, floats 15m above the unfinished Tower 1 hotel lobby. Drift should be a calming influence, but on Tuesday it was surrounded by 12,000 construction workers labouring furiously to complete the enormous project.Thomas Arasi, chief executive of Marina Bay Sands, a subsidiary of Las Vegas Sands, says he is unperturbed at the coup by RWS, which will on Wednesday book the first customers into its $4.7bn hotel, in spite of having received the government go-ahead licence six months later than Sands.Mr Arasi, whose bigger development is costing $5.5bn, will not be receiving paying customers until April, mainly because of delays caused by the engineering challenges involved in building three 55-storey curving hotel towers and a 120,000 square metre convention centre entirely on land reclaimed from the sea.“In the grand scheme of things it doesn’t matter very much,” says Mr Arasi. “We’re building a transformational asset, a once-in-a-lifetime property …the goal is always earlier, but from a long-term perspective it really doesn’t matter.”The delay will be costly for Singapore, which commissioned the two resorts as part of a grand plan intended to transform the country’s image from nanny state to racy resort city. The government wants to buttress manufacturing with a tourism sector earning S$30bn (US$21.5bn) in revenues by 2015 – triple today’s figure.The government estimates the full-year contribution to gross domestic product from the two resorts at 1.6 percentage points. This year though, the contribution is likely to be between 0.5 and one percentage point, Lim Hng Kiang, trade and industry minister, told parliament last week.Most analysts and economists say they expect the resorts to be successful, with 70 to 80 per cent of revenues coming from gaming this year, falling to 50 or 60 per cent as retail, entertainment and conference facilities are phased in over the next 12 months.However, the optimistic views seem to reflect Asia’s rapid recovery from the global financial crisis – even six months ago many analysts were much more sceptical, with some suggesting business could be so slow that GDP would benefit by only 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points a year over the next five years.“The perception last year was that the projects could be delayed, and there was a lot of uncertainty,” says Leong Wai Ho, economist at Barclays Capital research in Singapore. “That has melted away, and with Genting now opening ahead of schedule a lot of confidence has returned.”RWS, owned by Genting Singapore, a subsidiary of Malaysia’s Genting group, south-east Asia’s largest gaming group, expects to steal a second march on Sands in February, when, if all goes well, it will open the casino that is at the heart of the development.Getting the gambling tables open before Marina Bay Sands, which will not be accepting gaming chips for another six weeks or more, could give RWS a commercial advantage by allowing it to sign up regular local gamblers before they have a chance to try the Sands.Singapore has imposed a charge of S$100 a day or S$2,000 a year for residents to visit the tables as a way of calming vocal opposition to the casino developments from conservative Singaporeans who fear a spread of gambling addiction and even crime.
117;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2010-01-19T18:09:19Z;Singapore casinos roll dice on $10bn bet;;The first of two huge leisure and convention resorts based around casinos opens its doors in Singapore on Wednesday, rolling the dice on a $10bn bet by Las Vegas Sands and Malaysia’s Genting group on gambling in the city state.The resorts – officially forecast to add up to 1.7 percentage points to gross domestic product in a full year – have generated controversy because they introduce gaming for the first since time independence in 1965.By April, however, the island state that once banned chewing gum will be home to two of Asia’s biggest casinos, competing with Macao, the world’s leading gaming centre, for wealthy Asian gamblers.“This is an entirely new sector of the economy,” said Leong Wai Ho, an economist at Barclays Capital Research, who spent three years helping to plan the casino resorts while working for Singapore government.Mr Leong said the impact of the resorts would be multiplied across the economy, creating up to 40,000 jobs and boosting consumption as well-heeled tourists and business travellers flock to the city.The biggest of the resorts, the $5.5bn Marina Bay Sands in the city’s business district, will boast two theatres and a convention centre for 45,000 delegates as well as a casino.A 1.2 hectare park with three swimming pools will float 220m above the pavement, spanning three 55 storey hotel towers with 2,500 rooms.“I 101 per cent believe that this is transformational,” said Thomas Arasi, chief executive of Marina Bay Sands. “This is a once in a lifetime phenomenon.”Genting’s development, the $4.7bn Resorts World at Sentosa, located on an offshore leisure island, will have four hotels with 1,800 rooms, a Universal Studios theme park and the world’s largest oceanarium alongside the gaming tables.Genting, which will take its first hotel customers today expects to open its casino in time for the Chinese new year holiday in mid-February, with other attractions phased in later. Sands, delayed by construction and engineering challenges, will open its casino and hotels in April.Neither company would discuss revenue or profit targets, but people close to Sands say that it is hoping for net profits of between $800m and $1bn a year from next year, while the smaller Sentosa resort is thought to be expecting net earnings at about S$750m (US$539m).Both operators have shrugged off the impact of tough rules on junketing – gambling trips organised for wealthy gamblers by independent operators – introduced recently by the government to deter money laundering.“We’ve never expected that we would do a great deal of junket play here in Singapore,” said Mr Arasi.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.5 per cent to 10,583.96 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.7 per cent at 2,308.42.“The ISM [manufacturing] report was more encouraging news and we seem to be on track for a recovery,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “Towards the end of the year, a number of money managers were trying to protect gains. In that protective mode, people were not as aggressive about deploying money into equities. But now, when you take the gloves off, we’ll see what investors’ true inclinations are in terms of what they think about the economy and which sectors they put their money into.”The price of US crude jumped above $80 a barrel following encouraging Chinese manufacturing data, helping to lift the S&P 500 energy sector 2.8 per cent.Shares in Chesapeake Energy climbed 8.5 per cent to $28.09 after Total, Europe’s third-largest oil producer, agreed to buy a quarter of the company’s assets in Texas.The joint venture, which is worth up to $2.25bn, will allow Total to expand into the US shale gas business.Barron’s also forecast that Chevron’s share price could rally as much as 20 per cent over the next 12 months as oil prices rise.The recommendation helped the country’s second-largest energy producer gain 2.7 per cent to $79.06.Deutsche Bank gave an extra boost to CVR Energy and Tesoro, raising the oil refiners from “hold” to “buy”. CVR gained 8.3 per cent to $7.43 while Tesoro, which was identified as a potential takeover target, was up 9.3 per cent at $14.81.Metal prices also rose sharply, lifting Alcoa 3.3 per cent to $16.65. The steepest daily increase in gold prices for more than two months boosted shares in Barrick Gold, the world’s largest producer of the metal, 2.6 per cent to $40.39.Boeing, the world’s second-largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, helped to lift the industrials sector 1.7 per cent higher.Barclays Capital raised the stock to “overweight”, saying that the company was in a good position to benefit from recovery after resolving disputes with its suppliers and completing a successful 787 test flight.Jesup & Lamont also upgraded the manufacturer from “hold” to “buy”, making Boeing its top pick in commercial aerospace. Its shares were up 3.8 per cent to $56.18.Novartis surprised investors with a plan to buy out minority shareholders in Alcon, the US eyecare company, for the equivalent of $11.2bn in equity. The Swiss drugmaker had already agreed to purchase Nestlé’s majority stake in the company. The announcement sent shares in Alcon down 5.7 per cent to $154.98.In the financial sector, Credit Suisse raised Morgan Stanley from “neutral” to “outperform” on the same day as UBS raised its recommendation on the bank from “neutral” to “buy”.Analysts said this year would prove to be an “inflection point” for Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest US lender by assets, as it benefited from its joint venture with Smith Barney. Its shares rose 4.4 per cent to $30.91. UBS also gave a boost to casino stocks, raising both Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts from “neutral” to “buy”.Las Vegas Sands would be likely to beat gaming revenue estimates this year thanks to its Macau business, the bank’s analysts predicted.Its shares, which surged about 150 per cent last year, were up 11.2 per cent to $16.62. Wynn gained 9.8 per cent to $63.96 after analysts recommended the company on the basis of its attractive valuation.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, gained 2.4 per cent to $20.88 after hitting its highest intraday price for almost three months.
119;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-11-30T22:55:50Z;Adelson victorious in spite of disappointing IPO;;For a small Jewish boy who survived the mean streets of an Irish-dominated Boston, life doesn’t throw up too many challenges that Sheldon Adelson can’t handle.Mr Adelson, the 76 year-old chairman of Las Vegas Sands, was again laughing at adversity on Monday. Just eight months after the US gaming group’s shares bottomed at $1.38 – down from an all-time high of $144 in late 2007 – it successfully spun-off its Macao operations in an initial public offering in Hong Kong.As debuts go, Sands China’s was disappointing. The company’s shares closed 10 per cent down from their offer price, at HK$9.31. But for Mr Adelson, getting Sands China’s IPO away was victory enough.Most of the $2.5bn raised will flow back to Las Vegas Sands, while a $1.75bn project financing package will enable Sands China to restart construction on a hotel and casino expansion halted late last year. Mr Adelson argues that the completion of Lots 5 & 6, paired with the Venetian Macao casino resort, will give his company the critical mass to realise its vision for the Cotai Strip.In the run up to the IPO, Mr Adelson was crowing. “I’m gonna live forever,” he told reporters earlier this month, before qualifying his real chances at immortality. “I don’t intend to go anywhere . . . I intend to be around. I told my wife I intend to die [still] sitting at my desk.” It would be a brave man who bet against him.Pay revolution in FranceIn France there is often no greater compliment than to be described as a “servant of the state”.Every year scores of bright young graduates fight for places at the elite schools that churn out bureaucrats who work away in the back rooms of government. For the brightest, the reward after a few years of dedicated service is often a plum job running one of the many French industrial companies where the government, through outright ownership or a core shareholding, has the final say in management – Areva, France Telecom, Thales, Air France, and EDF to name but a few.These jobs have always paid less than their peers in the private sector, but the trade off has been that they bring prestige and influence in a country where proximity to power often counts for more.Yet even in France the world is changing. A dispute has broken out over the pay that will be awarded to the state’s newest servant, Henri Proglio, who has taken over at EDF, the government controlled utility.Mr Proglio, the grandson of Italian traders, does not come from the elite corps of civil servants.He says there is no reason he should accept a lower salary than the €2m he earned while executive chairman at Veolia Environnement, where he has also controversially been allowed to retain the post of non-executive chairman. This weekend he got backing from Francois Fillon the prime minister who said it was “perfectly normal” that the new head of EDF should not take a cut in pay, especially as the government had sought him out.It was a small revolution and has sparked a debate over whether the head of a public company should accept a lower salary as he works for the taxpayer rather than shareholders.It is clear this is not a comfortable subject for the government. EDF was hit badly by strikes over pay earlier this year, and the wage increase agreed recently for power workers gives employees a mere 2.8 per cent increase.Mr Proglio’s demand means, in effect, that the pay for the top job will jump 45 per cent. This is hardly likely to improve relations with EDF’s powerful unions.Nonetheless the government is right to stand firm on pay, assuming it remains reasonable and imposes some fairly tough criteria on performance – after all, EDF is still heavily protected in its home market.The group, with annual sales of close to €70bn, is one of Europe’s biggest power companies and is increasingly moving out into new markets. Rivals such as GdF-Suez, Eon and Enel are paying their top bosses close to three times what Mr Proglio’s predecessor was earning. If the government wants to get the best talent for its champions, it will have to pay the price.Far more worrying, however, is that the state shareholder does not appear to be taking as firm a stand on corporate governance. Allowing Mr Proglio to retain the top job at Veolia while also running EDF presents a host of potential conflicts that fly directly in the face of good practice. Even more so, as Mr Proglio has publicly voiced his desire to see EDF becoming Veolia’s core shareholder. In this context, salary may be a distraction, and the government risks paying a far heavier price for ignoring the real issue.world.view@ft.com

121;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-11-19T20:20:35Z;Fresh setback for Asian IPOs;;A high-profile Chinese investment fund has cancelled a proposed $1bn investment in Hong Kong’s largest initial public offering of 2009 in a sign of waning institutional appetite for the glut of Asian listings.The setback came as Ronald Arculli, chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, told Bloomberg that “we’re seeing signs of potential asset bubbles” in Asia.People familiar with the matter said Beijing-based Hopu Investment Management withdrew its order for China Minsheng Banking Corp after ruling that the lender had overpriced its shares.Hopu this year acquired multi-billion dollar stakes in Bank of China and China Construction Bank.Hopu’s move comes amid mounting worries of an asset price crash after a recent large rise in stock and property values.Hong Kong’s benchmark index has doubled from its March low while China’s Shanghai Composite index has rallied 56 per cent in the same period.Minsheng shares will start trading in Hong Kong next Thursday at HK$9.08 each, the mid-point of its indicative price range. The IPO will raise US$3.9bn but could rise to $4.5bn if an over-allocation option is later exercised.The Hopu order is understood to have been about 10 times larger than those of other global fund managers, including Soros Fund Management. But people familiar with the matter said Hopu judged that Minsheng did not offer value above HK$8.75 and it expected poor stock performance when retail investors exit the stock.Minsheng priced its shares on the basis of investor demand gathered during a global roadshow this week.Several recent large IPOs in Hong Kong, including gaming and property stocks, are trading below their offer price with some analysts blaming a glut of offerings for fickle investor sentiment.Two new listings in Asia climbed on their debuts yesterday, offering encouragement to several companies hoping to float in the coming weeks.Maxis, Malaysia’s leading mobile phone operator, closed 8.4 per cent higher at M$5.42 while Longfor Properties, the Chinese developer, ended 13 per cent higher at HK$8.01.Las Vegas Sands, controlled by tycoon Sheldon Adelson, is launching a US$3.35bn IPO in Hong Kong for its Macao business.

122;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-11-19T07:02:34Z;Minsheng raises $3.9bn from Hong Kong IPO;;China Minsheng Banking Corp will raise at least US$3.9bn with its Hong Kong initial public offering – but without the support of a high-profile Chinese private equity fund.People familiar with the matter said that Beijing-based Hopu Investment Management, which had sought US$1bn of stock, had cancelled its order after the company priced its shares above HK$9 each.“Hopu felt that Minsheng is overpriced above HK$8.75 a share and so withdrew its order,” said one person familiar with the matter.Hopu was set up last year by ex-Goldman Sachs dealmakers and this year gained prominence by snapping up multibillion-dollar stakes in Bank of China and China Construction Bank.Hopu’s price discipline contrasts with aggressive retail demand for exposure to a bank which is considered among the country’s best-managed lenders.Minsheng shares will begin trading next Thursday at HK$9.08 each, around the mid-point of the price range indicated during a global investor road show which ended this week.At US$3.9bn, the IPO is the largest in the city this year and the fifth biggest global listing in 2009.If the over-allocation option is exercised in the coming weeks, the full proceeds from the listing could reach US$4.5bn.Soros Fund Management, founded by George Soros, is among several overseas investors seeking to acquire a US$100m stake in Minsheng.Two new listings in Asia jumped on their debuts on Thursday, an encouraging sign for companies waiting to price their share sales in the region to raise more than US$12bn by the end of the year.Maxis, Malaysia’s leading mobile phone operator, rose as much as 10 per cent in early trading in Kuala Lumpur amid strong demand for the biggest listing in the country and southeast Asia. The shares were trading at M$5.42 at GMT 02:24, 8.4 per cent above its offer price of M$5.In Hong Kong, Longfor Properties, the Chinese developer, rose as much as 12.6 per cent despite investors becoming more cautious towards Chinese property stocks. The shares were at HK$7.77 by GMT 02:24, 9.9 per cent higher than its offer price of HK$7.07.According to Dealogic, at least 12 other companies are scheduled to price their IPOs in Asia before the end of 2009.

123;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-11-15T22:36:37Z;Sands IPO aims to resurrect Macao ambitions;;Las Vegas Sands’ $3.35bn Hong Kong initial public offering, which launches Monday, will enable the company to restart projects frozen one year ago in Macao, restoring its fortunes in the world’s largest gaming market, its chairman says.The global offering by Sands China, which operates three casinos in the Chinese special administrative region, caps a remarkable comeback for Sheldon Adelson, the self-made billionaire chairman and son of a Boston taxi driver.Last year Las Vegas Sands was forced to suspend construction on an extension to the Venetian Macao integrated resort complex, which includes the world’s largest casino, and warned investors that failure to raise emergency funds could result in “substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern”.The suspension of “Lots 5 & 6”, situated on a vast land reclamation known as the Cotai Strip, led to the loss of more than 10,000 construction jobs as Las Vegas Sands husbanded precious capital for another project under construction in Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands.Lots 5 & 6, located across from the Venetian Macao, were 65 per cent completed when mothballed.With $1.45bn in financing already secured and another $500m to be tapped from the IPO proceeds, Sands China says it will be able to complete phase one of the expansion by June 2011.When finished, Lots 5 & 6 will add 670 tables, 2,200 slot machines and 6,500 hotel rooms to the company’s arsenal – compared to 3,000 rooms across the strip at the Venetian.“It’s the minimum threshold that we believe we need to complete the Cotai Strip as a true destination resort,” Mr Adelson said.Sands China is the second-largest player in Macao, where total gaming revenues reached $10.4bn over the first three quarters of this year.Mr Adelson, 76, also dismissed concerns about succession at Las Vegas Sands – an issue raised by some investors during the company’s roadshow. “You’re looking at the succession plan,” he said, referring to himself, Michael Leven, Las Vegas Sands president, and Steven Jacobs, chief executive of Sands China.“I’m gonna live forever,” he added.Sands China’s IPO is being arranged by Goldman Sachs, Citibank and CLSA, with trading scheduled to start on November 30.
124;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-11-08T22:43:47Z;Minsheng plans $4.7bn IPO;;China Minsheng Bank will aim to raise up to $4.68bn through Hong Kong’s largest initial public offering this year in a move that should solidify China’s dominant position in the global IPO market.The country’s first privately owned lender will on Monday embark on a long-delayed roadshow in preparation for what will also be the world’s fourth-largest IPO of 2009, if the shares are priced at the top end of a range of HK$8.50-HK$9.50.If successful, Minsheng’s listing will give China five of the top 10 global IPOs this year.The bank plans to sell 3.32bn shares, or 15 per cent of its enlarged share capital, to raise as much as $4.1bn and could sell an additional 498m shares to take the total up to $4.68bn under a “greenshoe” option if the offering is heavily oversubscribed, which is often the case in Hong Kong.Unlike almost every other Chinese lender, Minsheng was established with investment from private entrepreneurs and virtually no state funding in 1996, but it is still in effect controlled by the government through Communist party appointments of top executives.The bank was listed on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2000 and has suspended previous plans to list in Hong Kong on at least two occasions.People involved in the sale said there was huge interest from institutional investors wanting to buy into the cornerstone tranche of the issue but the final price of the shares will be set in 10 days, depending on the result of the roadshow. Shares are expected to start trading in Hong Kong on November 26.IPOs in Hong Kong are open to global investors and allow Chinese companies to raise foreign exchange, while Shanghai listings are open only to domestic investors who cannot freely convert their funds out of renminbi.Minsheng’s plans to expand beyond China’s borders were dealt a blow on Friday when United Commercial Bank, a large San Francisco lender with branches in Hong Kong and Shanghai, became the 120th US bank to fail this year.Minsheng owns 9.9 per cent of UCBH Holdings, United Commercial’s parent company, and by the end of September had been forced to write down 93 per cent of the $126m it has invested over the past two years.● Gaming company Las Vegas Sands is set to raise up to HK$25.95bn ($3.35bn) through an initial public offering of shares in its Macao business, sources with knowledge of the IPO told Reuters. The company is selling 1.87bn shares at HK$10.38 to HK$13.88 per share, the sources said.
125;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-11-03T23:28:34Z;Las Vegas;;Las Vegas is a microcosm of the US economy, geared to the spending habits of the US consumer and thus facing an uncertain future. Lack of consensus on Sin City’s prospects was evident last week in the third-quarter results of its gaming companies, some of which narrowly escaped debt-related disaster this year. Wynn Resorts’ Steve Wynn rattled share prices with a gloomy prognosis for high-roller spending and downmarket regional operators echoed it. Yet, with MGM Mirage set to report on Thursday, convention specialist Las Vegas Sands ended the week trumpeting the return of group bookings, which bolster mid-week occupancy.MGM, which makes about 80 per cent of its earnings in the City of Dreams, is likely to be upbeat, as it has been throughout this downturn. The nightmare isn’t over, however. Visitors are spending less away from the tables, three-fifths of Strip revenues in 2008. Meanwhile, Vegas’s fortunes are more tied to conference and convention spending than previously, and sectors such as finance and automotive remain feeble. Aggressively filling 2010 schedules comes at the expense of room rates. With MGM’s CityCenter development adding 6,000 rooms this year, pricing pressure is set to rise.Doubts have started to creep in. After last week’s rout MGM shares are a third below their September high, at which point Barclays Capital notes they priced in spending growth similar to previous recoveries in spite of the mismatch between visitor numbers and room supply. The shares are still trading close to the top of their historical range for enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. True, they went higher in the froth of the credit spree. But a meaningful move upwards from here would require a bet on consumers returning to free-spending ways and a comeback for land sales and grandiose developments – all of which appear unlikely.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyThe Lex column is on Twitter
126;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Billionaire paid price to revive Sands’ fortunes;;Deep in the heart of the Venetian casino in Las Vegas, past the whirring slot machines, the canals and singing gondoliers, Sheldon Adelson is plotting the next phase of his company’s expansion.Poring over plans for Marina Bay Sands, his new $5.5bn casino hotel project in Singapore, the 76-year-old billionaire is in a combative mood, heaping scorn on the “doubting Thomases” who wrote off Las Vegas Sands during the financial crisis.It has been a tumultuous year for the casino resort group controlled by Mr Adelson. With markets tumbling following the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September, shares in Las Vegas Sands fell 99 per cent. They hit a low of $1.38 in March amid fears the company would breach its debt covenants and be forced into bankruptcy.In an interview with the Financial Times Mr Adelson, who ploughed $1bn of his own money into Las Vegas Sands to keep it afloat, says the company’s critics were wrong. “I kept saying to everybody: our business model is still intact. Why is the stock going down?”“It was bewildering to me. Nothing in our company had fundamentally changed. Our pipeline of growth was there and is still there today.”With resorts across the globe, Las Vegas Sands is asset-rich. But it is also highly leveraged, with net debt of about $10bn and a costly development pipeline that includes its project in Singapore and a cluster of new hotels in Macao that will supplement properties it operates there, such as the Venetian Macao and Sands Macao.Investor fears were stoked by the company’s admission last November that its ability to continue operations was in “substantial doubt” if it failed to raise new capital. The warning came as the group suspended construction of new projects in Macao.Yet Mr Adelson, the son of a Boston cab-driver, has succeeded over the past year in bringing the company back from the brink. A management shake-up and a capital injection of $1bn from the billionaire and his family helped the group to a more sound financial footing.The group shored up its balance sheet and completed a $2.1bn share sale. After hitting $1.38 in March the shares have climbed past $18, valuing the company now at $12bn.More recently, it announced plans for an initial public offering in Hong Kong of its Macao assets. Analysts expect the company to raise $2bn-$3bn, which could further firm up the balance sheet and mean construction of suspended Macao projects is restarted.Mr Adelson declines to comment on the Hong Kong IPO, which could happen by the end of next month. But he denies ever fearing that the group risked bankruptcy. “Never,” he growls. “Not for a moment. I wasn’t going to cap my career of 64 years with a loss.”However, he admits the year had some low points. “I bit the bullet and I sold equity. That was the lowest point …because I felt that my job was to enhance shareholder value and here I had diluted it, including [my own stake].“But I paid the price. I put up $1bn to save the company. We were down as low as [a market capitalisation of] $1bn and we’re back to $12bn today.”The equity sale diluted his stake from 69 per cent to 52 per cent. But the recent revival in the company’s shares has lifted the value of his holding up to $6bn from about $500m at the low point this year.Despite the improvement, his stake is still a long way off $36bn, the approximate value of his holding when Las Vegas Sands shares hit their peak of $144 in October 2007.Mr Adelson credits Michael Leven, his new chief operating officer, for much of the success in turning the company round. Mr Leven replaced Bill Weidner, Mr Adelson’s long-time second-in-command, who left Las Vegas Sands at the end of 2008. With Mr Leven in place, the group embarked on a cost-cutting programme, shedding 6,000 jobs and cutting $600m of costs.As trading conditions have stabilised, Mr Adelson reiterates his support for the group’s business model. Unlike his competitors MGM Mirage and Wynn Resorts, his model depends on the sale of non-core assets, such as shopping malls or condominiums, to support debt incurred in building his casino hotels.“I borrow money and I pay it back from the sale of non-core assets which I build specifically for this purpose. And then I’ll have my core assets debt free.” He estimates markets will return to normal within the next two or three years, allowing him to sell off non-core assets, such as the company’s retail operations in Macao.The past 12 months have been anything but normal, but analysts say Mr Adelson’s actions helped ensure Las Vegas Sands’ survival. “He bought stock in the open market, which was a sign he still believed there was a lot of inherent value in the company,” says Dennis Farrell, a gaming analyst with Wachovia Capital Markets. “It said: we believe this company is a survivor.”
127;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-10-13T15:13:06Z;Macao raises its game again;;This summer Macao-watchers had their eyes trained not on the former Portuguese colony, but the Adventist Hospital in Happy Valley on neighbouring Hong Kong.Day after day, journalists and cameramen waited outside the hospital, hoping to get the latest news of Stanley Ho, an 87-year-old casino magnate from Macao, who was admitted to a high-security ward in July after suffering a fall at home.The family and companies of the tycoon have shed little light on his situation, saying only that he is recovering. His transfer to Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital in late September did not end the media frenzy. Reporters only shifted camp.That Mr Ho’s health has become everyone’s focus highlights the significance of the most powerful businessman in a city of 500,000 people. Mr Ho has investments in everything from properties to ferries, but his most important asset is his gaming licence, which he has held since 1961.Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, his flagship company, was the sole casino operator in the city until 2002, when the government decided to end his monopoly and allow competition.The move was instrumental in transforming Macao from a smoke-filled gambling den to the world’s largest casino centre. Gross gaming revenues jumped fourfold from HK$27.8bn (US$3.6bn)in 2003 to HK$105.6bn in 2008, or bigger than what the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City generated together.But the introduction of five additional casino operators put pressure on Mr Ho, known as the “king of gambling”. He now competes with two of the US’s best-known gaming moguls, Sheldon Adelson and Steven Wynn, plus Hong Kong tycoon Lui Chee-woo – and with his children, Lawrence and Pansy.Mr Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands was the first foreign operator to set up shop in Macao. The opening of Sands Macao in 2004 was greeted with so much interest that visitors broke fences and smashed windows as they rushed in.The opening of Wynn Macao in 2006 and Venetian by Sands in 2007 continued to change the competitive landscape, as gamblers were lured to their glitzy gaming floors and swanky restaurants.The aim was to turn Macao from a day-trip market to an overnight travel destination, although that had not been very successful, since tourists typically stay only 1.3 days in Macao, similar to the average duration 10 years ago and just over a third of the 3.5 days in Las Vegas.But both Lawrence and Pansy have opted for the foreign model. Having teamed up with James Packer’s Crown and MGM Mirage respectively, Mr Ho’s two children now effectively compete with their father with sleek casino resorts that Mr Ho has refused to build.In June, Melco Crown, the joint-venture between Lawrence and Mr Packer, opened Macao’s newest casino. The $2.1bn City of Dreams helped the company double its market share to almost 18 per cent in July.Despite that, Mr Ho’s SJM remains the biggest force in Macao – its 19 casinos account for about 30 per cent of the market.And the good news for him and other operators is that after a slow first half, when gaming revenues fell 12.4 per cent year-on-year to $6.4bn, Macao is packed again as if the recession had never happened.The city had its best month ever in August, when gamblers swamped the baccarat tables in its 32 casinos and visitors queued for hours to watch a cartoon show of Dragon Pearl and its mysterious power in the City of Dreams.Visa restrictions on residents in neighbouring Guangdong province, one of Macao’s most important feeder markets, were relaxed recently, with gamblers now allowed to visit once a month compared with once every three months previously.The rosy situation is a far cry from the grim picture just a few months ago, when operators including Sands and Mr Lui’s Galaxy Entertainment were forced to halt construction.There were even talks that cash-strapped companies would have to sell part of their business to plug their funding gap.Francis Lui, Galaxy’s deputy chairman, says: “The recovery has been a lot faster than we expected. Both July and August were very good months. We saw the first year-on-year increase in revenues in July. Performance in August broke all records. It’s been very encouraging. We are very confident that this year will not be a bad year.”Oversupply, however, could become an issue, as new investment this year and next – which is expected to hit $5.9bn – might not be able to generate enough incremental profits, warns Gabriel Chan, head of casino and gaming research at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.“There is a bubble in the making because of oversupply,” says Mr Chan.
128;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-10-09T09:49:55Z;Wynn’s debut defies recent gloom;;Wynn Macau, controlled by US gaming tycoon Steve Wynn, rose as much as 13 per cent in its trading debut on Friday, defying the recent trend of disappointing first-day performances by new stocks in Hong Kong.Wynn shares closed up 6.9 per cent at HK$10.78, after hitting HK$11.40 in early trading. The company, which holds the Macao operations of Wynn Resorts, priced its US$1.6bn listing at the upper end of a price range at HK$10.08 a share.While Hong Kong’s initial public offering market has been very active, with a slew of companies still in the pipeline to sell shares in coming months, there has been concern about whether investor demand is cooling after a string of weak debuts.At least five companies dived below their issue prices on their trading debuts in Hong Kong since September. These include Glorious Property, which fell 15 per cent on its first day of trading last week, and Metallurgical Corporation of China, the world’s second largest IPO this year which closed down nearly 12 per cent on its debut last month.This week, Powerlong Real Estate, the Chinese property group, delayed the trading of its shares after pricing its HK$2.75bn (US$353m) IPO below an indicative range.However, sentiments appeared to be improving after five small listings advanced on their first day of trading in the last few days. Fine jewellery designer Eternite surged 62 per cent on Wednesday while Jiangchen, an apparel manufacturer, rose 110 per cent on Thursday.On Friday, people familiar with the situation said that United Company Rusal, the aluminium empire of Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, was seeking to raise up to US$2bn in Hong Kong in the next few months to repay debt, restarting an earlier listing plan that was postponed by the financial crisis last year.Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and Bank of China International are handling the IPO. They declined to comment.Rusal is reportedly in talks with a range of potential cornerstone investors, including Aluminium Corp of China, China Investment Corp, the sovereign wealth find, and Singapore’s Temasek, according to the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong.Wynn sold shares at a time when Macao, the world’s largest gaming market by revenue, is turning around from a weak first half. In August, the former Portuguese colony had its best month after gross gaming revenue jumped 17 per cent year on year to a record high of US$1.4bn.Visa restrictions on residents in neighbouring Guangdong province, one of Macao’s most important feeder markets, have been relaxed. Gamblers are now allowed to visit once a month compared with once every three months previously.Wynn’s strong performance should bode well for Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, which is also planning a Hong Kong listing of its Macao business this year.
129;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-10-05T23:36:45Z;Singapore prepares to embrace high-rollers;;In the last week of September, construction teams started lifting into place the steel underpinnings of Singapore’s already leafy latest park, which will float 55 storeys above the city, spanning the three hotel towers of the Marina Bay Sands.The innovative sky park is just one element in a new type of entertainment area – dubbed the integrated resort concept – aimed at luring high-spending international tourists to the island state and shedding its nanny-state image.Two such resorts are being built – one by Las Vegas Sands in Marina Bay, and one by Genting, the Malaysian conglomerate, on the resort island of Sentosa.Both are huge. Marina Bay Sands is expected to cost US$3.6bn with theatres, convention halls, shopping malls, a museum and hotel. Resorts World at Sentosa, costing S$6.6bn (US$4.7bn), will feature a Universal Studios theme park and the world’s largest oceanarium.At the centre of both complexes are Singapore’s first casinos, controversially approved by the government in an attempt to offer the kind of sophisticated international attraction that is represented by the city’s Formula 1 grand prix.Many Singaporeans are sceptical about the concept of resorts combining gambling with family entertainment, fearing they may bring gambling addiction and even crime to the tranquil city. However, the operators appear confident the casinos will generate substantial revenue. Michael Leven, president and chief operating officer of Las Vegas Sands, said in August that gaming revenue at Marina Bay Sands was likely to make up about 75 per cent of the resort’s initial earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.Analysts agree. Edward Ong at Macquarie in Singapore said the gaming market in the city was conservatively estimated at being worth between S$4.5bn and S$4.9bn, suggesting potential revenue of more than S$2bn for each casino.Abdul Jalil Rasheed, head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management in Kuala Lumpur, said he was optimistic about the Sentosa project, though it had been plagued by cost overruns.But much will depend on the pace of the globaleconomic recovery. “We already see a lot of positive economic signs,” said Thomas Arasi, president of Marina Bay Sands.

The health scare reignited speculation about who will inherit the billionaire’s vast commercial empire – especially Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau, his holding company; casino operator Sociedade de Jogos de Macau; and Shun Tak Holdings, a property and transport conglomerate.Mr Ho has 17 children by four wives. The two best-known children, Pansy and Lawrence, have Macao gaming joint ventures with, respectively, MGM Mirage and James Packer’s Crown.Pansy and Lawrence would have to exit those investments before becoming involved in SJM, where Mr Ho’s fourth wife, Angela Leong, is a director.Pansy, meanwhile, has the inside track at Shun Tak, where she is managing director."
131;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-09-30T16:37:43Z;Strong demand for Wynn IPO;;Wynn Resorts priced the $1.6bn initial public offering of its Macao operations on Wednesday at the top end of an indicative range amid strong demand as investors bet that the city’s gaming market would continue to improve.The US casino operator controlled by Steve Wynn plans to sell a 25 per cent stake in its Macao business in Hong Kong at HK$10.08 a share, the upper end of a price range of HK$8.52 to HK$10.08.In spite of recent disappointing performances of new listings in Hong Kong and competition from a flood of upcoming IPOs, investors rushed to buy Wynn shares on the back of good news on the state of the world’s biggest gaming market.Macao, the former Portuguese colony, had its best month in August after gross gaming revenue jumped 17 per cent year on year to a record high of $1.4bn.Visa restrictions on residents in neighbouring Guangdong province, one of Macao’s most important feeder markets, have been relaxed. Gamblers are now allowed to visit once a month compared with once every three months previously.Wynn’s IPO is being arranged by JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS.Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands is planning a Hong Kong listing of its Macao business this year.Just less than 13 per cent of Wynn’s IPO has been reserved for four tycoons from Hong Kong and Malaysia – Walter Kwok, Thomas Lau, Quek Leng Chan and Chua Ma Yu.Mr Wynn has said the IPO will make his group “more of a Chinese company”, although it will retain just $5m of the Hong Kong IPO proceeds for “general corporate purposes” in Macao.Wynn shares are due to begin trading on October 9.
132;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-09-23T21:31:46Z;Wynn Resorts upbeat about Hong Kong IPO;;The Hong Kong initial public offering of Wynn Resorts’ Macao operations will help the Las Vegas-based group realise its aspirations of becoming “more of a Chinese company”, according to Steve Wynn, its chairman.Wynn Resorts will raise up to $1.6bn by selling a 25 per cent stake in its Macao operations, as it becomes the first American-based company to establish a presence on the Hong Kong stock exchange.Macao’s gaming market, the world’s largest, was monopolised by Stanley Ho for 40 years until 2002, when five other concessions were extended to investors including Wynn Resorts and Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands group.Mr Ho, a Hong Kong-born tycoon of Chinese and Dutch ancestry, likes to present himself as the only truly local casino operator in Macao.His gaming flagship, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, is still the largest player, with a 30 per cent market share.But its leading position is under threat – especially from Las Vegas Sands, which has built the world’s two largest casinos in Macao, by number of tables.Mr Ho has played the nationalist card repeatedly over the years, fuelling speculation that the Chinese central government is worried about the growing influence of US commercial interests in Macao.Mr Wynn on Wednesday sought to play up his own company’s local credentials, although it will retain just $5m of the Hong Kong IPO proceeds for “general corporate purposes” in Macao.“The IPO is giving us the chance to share ownership of [our Macao] concession with Chinese investors and financial institutions …and basically become more of a Chinese company,” Mr Wynn said at a briefing in Hong Kong.He added that Wynn Resorts had originally hoped to enter Macao in 2002 with a Chinese partner, but a tie-up could not be arranged at the time.Just under 13 per cent of the Hong Kong offering has been reserved for two Hong Kong tycoons, Walter Kwok and Thomas Lau, and two Malaysian tycoons of Chinese descent, Quek Leng Chan and Chua Ma Yu.In contrast to his arch-rival Mr Adelson, Mr Wynn has taken a more cautious approach in Macao. He has so far opened just one property in the former Portuguese colony, the Wynn Macau, with another, Encore, slated to follow in April.But Wynn Resorts seems to have timed its Hong Kong IPO perfectly, with Macao casinos enjoying their best ever month in August after a slow first half.Mr Wynn also said visa restrictions on residents in neighbouring Guangdong province, Macao’s most important feeder market, had recently been relaxed, with gamblers now allowed to visit once a month compared to once every three months previously.
133;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
134;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-09-09T17:30:47Z;Genting Singapore in rights issue;;Genting Singapore, the Malaysian controlled company building one of two casino resorts in the island state, on Wednesday announced a S$1.63bn (US$1.14bn) rights issue aimed at shoring up its balance sheet and possible acquisitions.The company, a subsidiary of the Genting gaming group of Malaysia, sought to dampen rumours that its Resorts World development at Sentosa was significantly over budget, saying its costs were on track and it would open on schedule early next year.Justin Tan, managing director of Genting Singapore, said the rights issue would “strengthen the company’s financials and put us in a strong position to tap strategic opportunities”.However, analysts said it was likely the project was hitting its revised budget targets but costing much more than the S$5.2bn estimate when the contract was awarded in late 2006.“I think it is probably because of the cost overruns that Genting has had to incur in building this integrated resort,” said Abdul Jalil Rasheed, head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management in Kuala Lumpur.Mr Rasheed said Genting Singapore might be planning to invest part of the proceeds in initial public offerings in the Macao operations of Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands, which are expected to take place in Hong Kong later this year.Genting Singapore operates casinos and integrated resorts in several countries including Australia, Malaysia, the Philippines and the UK.Genting Singapore said it would offer shareholders one share for every five held at 80 Singapore cents, a discount of 33 per cent to the stock’s last traded price. Genting has agreed to subscribe for its 54 per cent of the rights issue.Genting Singapore shares, which have more than doubled in price this year, closed at S$1.19 on Tuesday. The shares were suspended in Singapore on Wednesday.The rights issue by Genting Singapore follows the sale in May by the family that owns its Malaysian parent of its entire 9 per cent personal stake in the Singapore unit for S$615m.
135;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;HK listing application lifts Las Vegas Sands;;Las Vegas Sands shares in the US rose on Thursday after the cash-strapped company announced it had applied for a possible listing in Hong Kong that is estimated would raise as much as $2bn this year.The casino operator, controlled by tycoon Sheldon Adelson, said it had filed an application with the Hong Kong stock exchange but no decisions had been made regarding the timing or terms of any such offering, according to a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Las Vegas Sands has been considering a Hong Kong public offering of its Macao assets for some months as the company aims to raise funds to complete its partially built projects in the world’s biggest casino market.The spin-off had been made possible after its bankers agreed to amend a $3.3bn credit facility last week, which allowed the company to sell a minority interest of its Asian businesses, while $500m of the proceeds must be used to repay debts.Las Vegas Sands, which has been struggling to service its debts, also said its lenders had agreed to give it six quarters of relief from its covenants and the option of issuing up to $1.5bn in bonds.While the company did not say how much it planned to raise in Hong Kong, JPMorgan analysts said the size of the listing, which could take place in late November or early December, was likely to be from $1bn to $2bn.“We believe this moves LVS one step closer to a clearer path of much-needed improving liquidity and balance sheet de-levering,” said the analysts, who estimated that the company could sell 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the operations.The share sale would be an important boost to the company’s balance sheet. Las Vegas Sands, which has opened two of the world’s largest casinos in Macao, has been forced to halt construction on some projects and slash thousands of jobs because of its financial problems.Macao casino companies are experiencing a tough operating environment as the global financial crisis and Beijing’s visa policies dissuaded people from gambling. First-half gaming revenues dropped 12.4 per cent year on year to $6.4bn.Las Vegas Sands shares rose 3.5 per cent to $13.19 on Thursday after earlier reaching a high of $13.47. The stock has jumped about 40 per cent this month.
136;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-08-14T16:01:09Z;Las Vegas Sands wins $3.3bn debt deal;;Las Vegas Sands, the casino operator controlled by billionaire Sheldon Adelson, has received a boost after its bankers agreed to amend a $3.3bn credit facility, allowing it to spin off its Macao operations.The company, which is considering a Hong Kong initial public offering of its Macao assets, said the amendment permitted it to sell a minority interest of the businesses, while $500m of the proceeds must be used to repay debts.Las Vegas Sands, which has been struggling to service its debts, also said its lenders had agreed to give it six quarters of relief from its covenants and the option of issuing up to $1.5bn in bonds.Mr Adelson, chairman and chief executive, said the deal was vital for the company to maintain and improve liquidity.“The amendment significantly increases our financial flexibility and permits us to pursue a potential listing of a minority interest in our Macao operations on an Asian stock exchange,” he said.Hit by the economic downturn and Beijing’s tightening of its visa policies, first-half gaming revenues in Macao, the world’s biggest casino market, dropped 12.4 per cent year-on-year to $6.4bn. Macao’s casino operators are going through their toughest period since the industry was liberalised in 2002.Las Vegas Sands, the most aggressive foreign casino operator in Macao, has been forced to halt construction on some projects and cut thousands of jobs, raising doubts about its operational ability.The latest deal would give it the financial muscle to carry on, analysts said.“Las Vegas Sands needs to do the IPO to raise funds. The listing would help it to solve some its financial problems,” said Billy Ng, gaming analyst at JPMorgan.Apart from the listing, Las Vegas Sands said it had obtained permission to raise up to $1bn of senior secured notes, provided that net proceeds from the issuance would be used to pay down outstanding loans. The company could also issue $500m of senior secured or unsecured notes if its leverage ratio goes down.The amendment also lifts the annual interest rate for the loans to Libor plus 5.5 per cent, Las Vegas Sands said. The rate will drop to Libor plus 4.5 per cent if the company successfully lists the Macao operations and pre-pays $500m in outstanding loans.Rival Melco Crown Entertainment, meanwhile, has raised $200m in the US to help repay debts.
137;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-07-21T22:24:57Z;Wynn files to list Macao unit in Hong Kong;;A Las Vegas-based casino company has taken the lead in a race to become the first international casino operator to list in Hong Kong, taking advantage of renewed investor appetite for stocks with links to the world’s biggest gambling market.Wynn Resorts, controlled by Steve Wynn, hopes to float a minimum 25 per cent interest in its Macao operations. The spin-off is expected to raise $1bn-$2bn by the end of this year. However, people involved in the transaction cautioned that “the total amount [sought] is not clear”.Wynn Resorts has submitted a preliminary filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.The application gives Mr Wynn a head start on his rival Sheldon Adelson, whose Las Vegas Sands is mulling a similar Hong Kong initial public offering for its Macao assets.Las Vegas Sands has invested more aggressively in the Chinese special administrative region, opening the world’s two largest casinos there, but has been struggling to service its debts.Wynn Resorts’ IPO application comes despite figures, released on Monday by Macao’s gaming regulator, that showed that first-half gaming revenues fell 12 per cent year-on-year to 51.4bn patacas ($6.4bn) ..The Chinese government, concerned that Macao’s gaming industry was growing too fast, has made it more difficult for its citizens to obtain visas to visit the former Portuguese enclave.Macao gaming revenues rose in five years – from 41.4bn patacas in 2004 to 108.7bn last year – making the market bigger than rivals Las Vegas and Atlantic City combined.“This is not controlled by the company but by the Chinese government – the government can increase the visa numbers,” said one person involved in the IPO. “But no one doubts the dogged determination of the Chinese gambler.”Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and their advisers are betting that investors will focus on Macao’s long-term future as China’s only legal gambling destination. While the territory is on track to record its first annual fall in casino revenues since the industry was liberalised in 2002, table capacity is expected to increase 25 per cent by the end of the year.UBS, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are advising Wynn Resorts. The company and its sponsors declined to comment.The Macao gaming flagships of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau and Galaxy Entertainment are already listed on the territory’s bourse.Shares in both companies have rebounded sharply from lows reached late last year.The benchmark Hang Seng Index has also soared 72 per cent since March, closing on Tuesday at 19,501.73.PwC estimates that companies will raise HK$100bn ($12.9bn) through Hong Kong IPOs this year.
138;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-07-20T19:31:30Z;Macao;;"A little-noticed filing said it all. Hong Kong-listed Macau Success, a HK$1bn regional tour operator once known as Travel Success, is changing its name again. Call it Success Universe Group, please. Association with the world’s biggest gambling hub used to confer glamour. Today’s connotations – profligacy, over-stretch – are less desirable. Casino revenues in Macao, down 12 per cent in the first half, are heading for their first year-on-year decline. VIP baccarat, responsible for about two-thirds of takings, was down almost a fifth.Against tough comparables – mainland China’s visa clampdown began last June – and a weak global backdrop, that may not seem disastrous. Annualised, those revenues would still top 2007. But concessionaires have bloated cost bases. City of Dreams, Melco Crown Entertainment’s rival to Las Vegas Sands’ Venetian on the Cotai strip, just bumped up table numbers by about 14 per cent, with more capacity expected by year-end. Indebted casino operators, many with covenants tied to earnings, resort to freebies and rebates to protect market share. City of Dreams’ average daily mass-market takings in its first month were slightly more than a third of the Venetian’s daily haul in the first quarter.A sharp second-half recovery in traffic seems unlikely. Of the 7m Chinese who visited Macao on individual visit visas last year, about four-fifths came from export-led Guangdong, one of China’s hardest-hit provinces. And with Macanese unemployment contained by the surge in capacity, Beijing is unlikely to relax visa restrictions designed to limit visits from the mainland soon. At the margin, two new casinos in Singapore and one in Manila won’t help. Four of the big six operators should make a loss this year.

139;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-07-20T17:32:33Z;Macao suffers fall in casino revenues;;The world’s largest gambling market is on track for its first year-on-year decline since it was opened to foreign competition in 2002.Macao, the Chinese special administrative region near Hong Kong, has reported a 12.4 per cent decline in first-half casino revenues to 51.4bn patacas ($6.4bn).If the trend continues, driven by a 20 per cent fall in visitor arrivals, this year will be the first to see a contraction since the monopoly of Stanley Ho, the veteran gambling tycoon, was broken up seven years ago.Macao’s liberalisation attracted multi-billion dollar investments by some of the world’s largest gaming companies, including Las Vegas Sans, Wynn Resorts and MGM Mirage. Las Vegas Sands, which has struggled to meet its debt payments and suspended a Macao expansion project late last year, operates the world’s two largest casinos in the tiny territory.Controlled by Sheldon Adelson, Las Vegas Sands is considering a spin-off of its Macao assets on the Hong Kong stock exchange.Macao, with a population of 550,000, is dependent on visitors from mainland China.The Chinese government, however, has been restricting visa access since the middle of 2008.An investment bank gaming analyst said: “The key factor is what happens in July. In the second half we’re looking for a bit of a rebound.”Exacerbating the pressure on Macao casinos, the June opening of City of Dreams– a joint venture resort by Mr Ho’s son, Lawrence, and James Packer of Australia – contributed to a 14 per cent increase in first-half capacity.Stanley Ho’s gaming flagship, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, will open two more casinos before the end of the year, bringing 10 per cent more tables on to the market.Macao’s gaming market is heavily reliant on high-rollers who typically account for two-thirds of the territory’s casino revenues. Takings from VIP baccarat fell by 19 per cent in the first half, as the middlemen who find high-rollers for casinos and often collect their debts – reined in credit.
140;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-06-16T21:34:27Z;Chui to become Macao chief;;Fernando Chui will automatically become the next chief executive of Macao, the smaller of China’s two special administrative regions after Hong Kong, having secured 95 per cent support from the members of a pro-Beijing “election committee”.Mr Chui, Macao’s former secretary for social and cultural affairs, told reporters on Tuesday he had obtained 286 nominations from the territory’s 300-member election committee. With 50 nominations required to enter the race, no one else will be able to run against him.The result will please the Chinese government, which has been unnerved during recent years by what it regards as “political instability” in Macao and Hong Kong.In 2007 Alan Leong, a pro-democracy barrister, won enough backing to challenge Hong Kong’s incumbent chief executive, Donald Tsang, in a race decided by the city’s own 800-member election committee. Mr Tsang went on to defeat Mr Leong in a landslide.More worryingly for Beijing, public anger spilt on to Macao’s streets in 2007, reflecting widespread discontent by people who felt left behind by the former Portuguese colony’s casino-led economic expansion.Discontent was intensified by a corruption case that brought down the territory’s public works secretary.Like his predecessor, Edmund Ho, Mr Chui is a member of one of the territory’s richest families.There had been widespread speculation that Ho Chio-meng – Macao’s popular chief prosecutor who rose through the judicial system in neighbouring Guangdong province – might challenge Mr Chui for the post.Although it has a population of only 550,000, Macao is the world’s largest gaming market, with casino revenues that exceed those of its two largest rivals – Las Vegas and Atlantic City – combined.Last year, the revenues of Macao’s 31 casinos increased by more than one-third to 108.8bn patacas ($13.6bn).However, Beijing has successfully acted to reign in Macao’s rampant growth by limiting visa access for Chinese tourists and gamblers. In the first quarter of this year, casino revenues fell by 12.8 per cent against the same period last year.Macao is the only place in China where casinos are allowed to operate. Its gaming industry was liberalised in 2002, attracting billions of dollars in investments from foreign casino operators including Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Mirage.Mr Chui, to take office in December, will preside over a gaming industry within which competition is intensifying as Las Vegas Sands and MGM Mirage struggle to service their debts.Rival operators hope those debts could force them to sell some of their coveted Macao operations.
141;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-06-09T23:00:38Z;Genting buys 3.2% stake in MGM Mirage;;Genting, the Malaysian gaming group, has paid $100m for a 3.2 per cent stake in MGM Mirage, firming a relationship that could help pave the way for future deals in Macao and the US.Genting matched the $100m that Kirk Kerkorian, MGM Mirage’s largest shareholder, invested in the US gambling group’s $1bn equity offering last month. Genting and Mr Kerkorian’s Tracinda Corp each bought 14.3m shares at $7.In addition to the share purchase, which Genting was not required to disclose, the group bought $100m in MGM Mirage secured notes. Genting confirmed the bond purchase in stock exchange filings on May 21. Genting, founded by Lim Goh Tong, the late Malaysian Chinese tycoon, is particularly keen to explore opportunities in Macao, where MGM Mirage has a 50-50 joint venture with Pansy Ho, the daughter of Stanley Ho, the Hong Kong gaming magnate.MGM Mirage and Las Vegas Sands, which operate the world’s two largest casinos in Macao, have been struggling to reduce their debt burdens, inviting speculation that they could be tempted to raise cash by selling stakes.Justin Leong, head of strategic investments and corporate affairs for Genting, said: “We are constantly looking to broaden our portfolio of strategic investments and strengthen partnerships around the world.”However, a recent determination by New Jersey gaming officials that Ms Ho is an “unsuitable” partner for MGM Mirage, which owns 50 per cent of the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, has put any follow-up deals in Macao on hold.Genting had been interested in potentially taking a stake in Ms Ho’s $1.25bn joint venture casino with MGM Mirage, the MGM Grand Macau.In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, MGM Mirage said New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement had recommended that it be “directed to disengage” from its joint venture with Ms Ho.New Jersey’s Casino Control Commission has not commented on the DGE’s recommendation but is expected to hold a hearing on the matterMGM Mirage, which has been hit by lower visitor spending in its key Las Vegas market, said it welcomed the Genting investment. “It is a statement of confidence . . . that Genting would invest alongside Tracinda.”
142;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-05-27T17:48:00Z;Owners of Genting sell stake;;The family that owns Malaysia’s Genting gaming group on Wednesday sold its entire 9 per cent personal stake in its Singapore unit for S$615m after seeing the shares more than double over the past few months.Genting still retains a 55 per cent stake in Genting Singapore, which is scheduled to open a casino theme park on Singapore’s resort island of Sentosa next year in partnership with Universal Studios.On Wednesday shares in Genting fell nearly 18 per cent to 71 Singapore cents, after it emerged the Lim family stake sale had been priced at 72 Singapore cents a share.The Lim family shares in Genting Singapore were offered at a discount of up to 16.8 per cent on Tuesday’s closing price through private placements with institutional investors. JP Morgan and UBS served as bookrunners and underwriters on the deal.On Tuesday, Genting Singapore hit an intraday high of 91 Singapore cents, a peak last posted two years ago shortly after Genting won the bid to build and operate the city-state’s second casino. In February, Genting Singapore was trading at a low of 41 Singapore cents a share.The share disposal comes amid concerns for the Singapore gaming industry over whether Genting’s Singapore casino and another one to be operated by Las Vegas Sands will be able to attract large numbers of visitors at a time when the city-state is suffering its worst recession since independence in 1965.Earnings for the parent Genting group have also been hurt by the poor performance of its Stanley Leisure unit in the UK.Genting Singapore has said it will complete the Sentosa project on time in the first quarter of 2010 and that it will not have to resort to further borrowings for the project.The company has been mentioned as a possible bidder for the MGM Grand Macau, which is expected to sell a 50 per cent stake to reduce its debt burden for its parent group.Genting on Wednesday said that it was open to acquisitions but declined to say whether it was considering an investment in Macao. Speculation about such a move was triggered by Genting’s decision last week to subscribe to $100m worth of notes issued by MGM Mirage, the US parent group.Genting is due to release its first quarter results on Thursday following those of Genting Singapore two weeks ago.
143;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-05-15T19:13:31Z;Macau;Holding out for the high-rollers;"If you build it, they will come. The premise worked for a while in Macau. But now Asia’s gambling paradise is in more than a spot of bother. Gross gaming revenues fell by 11 per cent in April, year on year, and by almost 15 per cent from March. Total takings dropped more than a fifth from the all-time high of $1.3bn recorded in January last year.For now, the only thing going up is buildings: City of Dreams, Melco Crown Entertainment’s $2.1bn rival to Las Vegas Sands’ Venetian, throws open its doors to punters in three weeks. That could give the market at least a short-term boost. Revenues across the city-state rose by a quarter after the Venetian opened in August 2007, compared with takings during the three prior months.Yet, for operators, that must seem a lifetime away. Macau may still look like it is a money-spinner: net income per table, per day, is $8,000, versus about $2,500 in Vegas. But capital structures predicated on vertiginous top-line growth are resulting in some shaky-looking balance sheets among the top-five casino operators: average net debt-to-equity ratios (excluding Stanley Ho’s very lightly geared SJM) will be about 1.6 to 1 this year.The core problem is dwindling ranks of high-rollers on VIP packages. These typically account for about two-thirds of total revenues. The mass-market segment is holding up reasonably well, down only 5 per cent in April – most of them Chinese thrill-seekers on single-visit visas from neighbouring Guangdong (population: 59m). But the VIP segment, by contrast, fell a full 15 per cent.Operators are responding by folding tables and letting staff go: Las Vegas Sands, the most indebted, announced plans this week to cut up to one in four of its 17,500 Macanese jobs by September, on top of the 2,500 axed last year. That should help, as may a new Macau chief executive, due for election in July, who should push for a lifting of visa restrictions from the mainland. But an unusually sweaty summer awaits.Las Vegas Sands, controlled by billionaire Sheldon Adelson, plans to cut as many as 4,000 more jobs in Macau as the casino operator seeks to reduce costs.Between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs will be eliminated by September, on top of the company’s workforce reduction to 17,500 from “close to 20,000” at its headcount peak in Macau, Michael Leven, new chief operating officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday.Las Vegas Sands last year stopped work on its $12bn, 20,000-room complex of hotels and casinos on Macau’s Cotai Strip amid near-frozen credit markets, dwindling revenue and the risk of defaulting on some loans. The company, which also shelved the $600m St Regis Residences in Las Vegas and other projects in Pennsylvania, raised capital and cut worker hours and jobs to trim more than $470m in costs.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

144;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-05-13T15:43:03Z;Las Vegas Sands cuts 4,000 jobs in Macao;;Las Vegas Sands will eliminate as many as 4,000 jobs in Macao, as it scrambles to reduce costs in the world’s largest gaming market.Michael Leven, the gambling company’s newly appointed chief operating officer, was cited by Bloomberg as saying that the cuts would be implemented by September. Reporting its first-quarter results last week, the company had said it aimed to pare $270m a year off operating expenses in Macao through reductions in headcount and other operating expenses.In November, Las Vegas Sands, controlled by US billionaire Sheldon Adelson, suspended construction work on two new integrated resort projects, known as “sites 5 & 6”, leading to redundancies for at least 9,000 migrant construction workers from nearby Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.The company needed to husband cash for a new development project in Singapore, where it is one of two concessionaires and is racing to meet government construction deadlines. The decision left two massive concrete skeletons in the heart of Macao’s Cotai Strip, the Chinese special administrative region’s answer to Las Vegas.Las Vegas Sands, which has until the middle of next month to restart construction on the projects or face penalties from its contractors, is in talks with at least three possible investment partners, according to people familiar with the negotiations. “All those [contractors’] costs will be sued for if they do nothing,” said one person close to the company.The decision to freeze the sites tested the patience of government officials in the territory, which generates the bulk of Las Vegas Sands’ earnings – through its Venetian, Sands and Four Seasons casinos – but has borne the brunt of the company’s recent cutbacks. Macao accounted for 70 per cent of Las Vegas Sands’ first-quarter revenues.“I know the Venetian’s boys there are under a lot of pressure,” said a banking executive with one of the company’s creditors. “They have a clear job to do and that is to exceed expectations. By anyone’s standards [the Venetian] been a success. It’s just that Sheldon wanted to do it all at once.”The additional cutbacks come at a sensitive time for the Macao government, which has responded to populist sentiment by putting pressure on casino operators to reduce the number of overseas workers they employ. The territory will also select a new chief executive in July.On Tuesday, Fernando Chui, Macao’s culture minister, announced his bid for the office. There is widespread speculation that Ho Chio-meng, the territory’s popular chief prosecutor, may also throw his hat into the ring.
145;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-05-05T22:20:08Z;Gambling’s hot streak;Are the odds of a payoff getting worse?;"Who needs the thrill of striding into a casino and wagering one’s entire pay cheque on a roll of the dice when casino stocks offer a similar risk and reward? Intrepid investors who bought shares of US industry leaders in early March have hit the jackpot but would be wise to cash in their chips. Since then, two deeply indebted operators, MGM Mirage and Las Vegas Sands, jumped more than 500 and 600 per cent, respectively. Less imperilled Wynn Resorts rose more than 120 per cent, rallying nearly 15 per cent on Tuesday after reporting a quarterly loss. All three have either raised expensive cash or had to negotiate with lenders or both and none is out of the woods completely.Following their bounce, the big operators remain well off their 2007 highs, but the risk-reward equation is starting to look like a sucker’s bet. Las Vegas Sands trades about nine times 2010 enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – a multiple that implies not just survival but a rapid recovery. Wynn, which deserves a higher valuation, also looks rich at 12 times EV/ebitda. Measures like revenue per available room and occupancy rates have stabilised but should remain below peak levels for some time. This is a challenge for high fixed-cost companies facing hefty debt.Casinos remain a good business – it was over expansion in glitzy destinations such as Las Vegas and Macau that harmed these operators. Traffic has held up in less glamorous locales not requiring a hotel stay. Three US operators that eschewed Las Vegas are Ameristar, Penn National Gaming and Pinnacle Entertainment. This grouping outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of almost 30 percentage points in the past year while the aforementioned Vegas operators underperformed by 40 points.Speculators have prospered recently by owning the higher-risk operators but should recognise when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

146;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-04-27T22:03:46Z;Macao’s City of Dreams bets on high rollers;;On Cotai Strip, a reclaimed area in Macao billed as Asia’s answer to Las Vegas, workers are busy putting the finishing touches on City of Dreams, the newest casino in the former Portuguese colony.With a dome-shaped theatre, a Hard Rock-themed casino, stylish nightclubs and Harley Davidson motorcycles in the jackpot, Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) is betting that the $2.1bn project will be able to defy a slowing market in Macao and a deepening global recession when it opens its doors in June.In 2008, gaming revenue in Macao grew by 31 per cent to $13.5bn but there was a sharp slowdown in September after Beijing imposed visa restrictions that curtailed visitors to casinos from some parts of mainland China. High-rollers, meanwhile, also found it more difficult to tap credit as the global financial crisis worsened.For Lawrence Ho, son of “king of gambling” Stanley Ho and MPEL’s chief executive, the success of City of Dreams is not only crucial for his company but also the empire of the Ho clan, the most powerful family in Macao.When Macao ended Stanley Ho’s 40-year gaming monopoly in 2002 and granted licences to international tycoons, including Sheldon Adelson of Las Vegas Sands and Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts, some called it the end of an era.Analysts predicted Sociedade de Jogos de Macao (SJM), Stanley Ho’s gaming flagship, would lose its leading position as early as this year as bigger casinos and shinier gaming floors built by US rivals were expected to outdo his smoky gambling dens.In 2004, when Mr Adelson opened Sands Macao, the first casino operated by a foreign investor, doors were smashed and fences broken as gamblers forced their way in.The opening of Wynn Macao in 2006 and Venetian in 2007 continued to captivate the crowds and put more pressure on Stanley Ho.But five years on, SJM is still the biggest casino operator in Macao, the world’s largest gaming market.Las Vegas Sands and MGM Mirage, SJM’s heavily-leveraged foreign rivals, have recently been preoccupied with refinancing loans taken out during the boom times.Las Vegas Sands has stopped construction of its partially-finished developments on Cotai, where most building work by other casino operators has also been halted.Cranes now loom over idle building sites.The company, which has been struggling to offload its real estate and retail properties at the Venetian, has also declined to comment on speculation that it would sell Sands Macao, saying only that it would continue to explore all options.Analysts have speculated that cash-strapped MGM Mirage, which has a Macao joint venture with Pansy Ho, Stanley Ho’s daughter, could be forced to sell its 50 per cent stake in the tie-up, most likely to its partner.“By maintaining its leadership for so long, SJM has proved a lot of people wrong,” says Billy Ng, analyst at JPMorgan, who expects Stanley Ho to maintain a lead until at least next year.With Lawrence Ho and Pansy Ho, the Ho family has three of Macao’s six gaming licences and control about half of the sector, which has grown about five times since 2002.“Their market share may be smaller but don’t forget the pie is much bigger now,” says Gabriel Chan, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Adding to this is Shun Tak, Stanley Ho’s conglomerate, which has been benefiting from the territory’s breakneck growth in the last few years thanks to its vast interests in Macao’s property, transportation and hospitality industries.All these give the Ho family an upper hand again.City of Dreams is set to put MPEL, a partnership between Lawrence Ho and James Packer’s Crown group, in the best position to benefit from any turnround in Macao’s gaming sector.The property is likely to be the only large-scale casino opening in the enclave in the next two to three years.It is estimated to double MPEL’s market share to about 17 per cent in 2010.Although casino revenue in the first quarter of 2009 dropped 13 per cent from the same period last year, it was 8 per cent higher than the level in 2008’s fourth quarter and in line with the third-quarter figure. This is in spite of the fact that the beginning of the year is traditionally a low season.According to Morgan Stanley, gaming revenue in Macao is expected to decline 11 per cent in the first half of 2009 but is likely to rebound by 4 per cent in the second half of the year.“The worst is likely to be over as long as there are no more big corporate problems,” says Francis Lui, deputy chairman of Galaxy Entertainment, a Macao casino operator. “This year I am cautiously optimistic.”
147;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2009-01-13T17:23:11Z;Macao hopes good times will roll;;Beijing is this year likely to remove some of the visa restrictions that have prevented mainland Chinese from travelling to Macao, the chief executive of one of Macao’s six casino operators said.The restrictions have contributed to a sharp downturn in the territory’s gaming revenues,Lawrence Ho – son of gambling tycoon Stanley Ho and chief executive of Nasdaq-listed Melco Crown Entertainment – told the FT that he expected Macao’s gaming industry to rebound in the second half of this year after a difficult 2008.Beijing last year tightened the frequency and ease with which gamblers can travel to Macao, in order to tame explosive growth in the territory’s gaming market, a mainstay of its economy.The travel restrictions, coupled with the financial crisis, reduced casino revenues in December for the third month in four. Las Vegas Sands and other gaming companies have halted construction of properties and delayed openings of new casinos.Mr Ho said he was confident China would support the former Portuguese colony’s efforts to overcome the “financial tsunami” by allowing more Chinese citizens to go gambling there.Mr Ho said he expected Beijing to announce some stimulus policies around the summer to welcome the announcement of a new chief executive in Macao, who will take office in December.“History tells us that in Hong Kong and Macao …whenever a new leader or a government is put in place, China would want to give that leader a running start,” said Mr Ho.Edmund Ho, Macao’s chief executive (who is not related to Lawrence Ho), has said monthly casino revenues would drop from an average of 8bn patacas in 2008 to 7bn patacas this year.But Lawrence Ho said “the market has hit bottom and is on the way up”. The government estimates were “somewhat conservative,” he said.“The worst months have probably come and gone. September and October were very difficult,” he said. “This year I am hopeful.”Mr Ho said the industry’s revenues had dropped only 10 per cent so far in January, against the 30 per cent annual fall anticipated by analysts.Melco Crown is due to launch a $2.1bn casino in the second quarter of this year. The project is likely to be the only large-scale casino to open in Macao in 2009 and 2010.Separately, Mr Ho said yesterday the company would be interested in developing casinos in Taiwan, which legalised gambling on its offshore islands this week.“We are interested in the market. But we will have to do more studies,” he said.
148;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-12-19T00:20:11Z;Trump considers rescue for gaming company;;Donald Trump, the real estate mogul and television personality, is considering whether to rescue his ailing gaming group by taking it private, according to people familiar with the situation.Mr Trump owns 24 per cent of Trump Entertainment Resorts, which is struggling to meet its debt obligations and has missed a $53m interest payment.The group, which operates three properties in Atlantic City, is saddled with $1.7bn of debt, of which about $1.2bn is bond debt.It could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection if it fails to make the interest payment within a 30-day grace period, which expires at the end of the month.Although Mr Trump is the group’s non-executive chairman, he has no managerial role at the company, which represents less than 1 per cent of his net worth.He declined to comment on his plans for Trump Entertainment. But he told the Financial Times that the casino industry was “in a disastrous state . . . the worst it’s ever been in”.Trump Entertainment’s Atlantic City rivals are all struggling to cope with lower volumes of visitors and new competition in Pennsylvania and New York.In Las Vegas, the largest US gaming market, MGM Mirage has suspended some development projects, while Las Vegas Sands, owner of the Venetian, recently raised doubts about its ability to continue operating as a going concern because it risked defaulting on its debt.Mr Trump is likely to face some tough negotiations with the group’s bondholders if he is to take the company private.Its market value has fallen to just $7m amid concerns about its ability to continue day-to-day operations. Analysts said that a debt for equity swap was one possibility, while Mr Trump might also inject new cash into the business.“The question is: does the company file for Chapter 11 first and then settle this in court or does it do an out of court restructuring?” said Dennis Farrell, an analyst at Wachovia Capital Markets.Mr Trump said the gaming slump would have no bearing on his other businesses – but he acknowledged there would be a delay in the residential element of his plan to build a golf resort and housing complex on the Aberdeenshire coast in northeastern Scotland.He said development would begin soon, although he would wait for market conditions to improve before starting work on the residential component.
149;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-11-17T01:02:40Z;Good times gone as Macao casinos halted;;Billy Chan first felt the impact of the global financial crisis a few weeks ago when he realised he could sleep in for an extra half hour every morning.Mr Chan commutes from Guangdong province to Macao, the Chinese special administrative region and gambling centre, where he is a construction supervisor on a casino development belonging to Las Vegas Sands.Earlier this month he noticed that the queues at the border were getting shorter. As Las Vegas Sands struggled to raise capital, construction was curtailed and the number of workers crossing the border began to fall. “I used to spend 45 minutes going through immigration in the morning,” Mr Chan, a Hong Kong native, told the Financial Times. “Now it takes 15 minutes.”Last week Las Vegas Sands, which already operates three casinos in Macao, confirmed that it was suspending work at “sites five and six”, the future home of yet more gaming facilities and also international brand-name hotels, including Shangri-La, Sheraton and St Regis.About 9,000 migrant labourers from China and Hong Kong will have to find jobs elsewhere. Another 2,000 Macanese construction workers may also be affected.The Macao and Hong Kong governments are bracing themselves for the fallout, illustrating how quickly a crisis on Wall Street can affect a Las Vegas casino company, then boomerang to cities on the other side of the world. On Sunday dozens of workers, including some of Mr Chan’s former colleagues, marched on Hong Kong government headquarters. “We have returned home and we want jobs,” their placards read. Hong Kong’s Construction Industry Employees General Union wants the government to speed up work on local infrastructure projects.Back in Macao, Las Vegas Sands’ woes have forced Edmund Ho, the territory’s chief executive, to put a novel twist on the global bail-out fad. As western governments rush to the rescue of banks, insurers and even struggling car companies, Mr Ho has anointed his government casino operator of last resort in the world’s largest gambling market.“We will not allow any casinos to shut down,” the chief executive said after his annual address to legislators on November 11, adding that if necessary his administration would keep bankrupt casinos operational until a white knight was found. The chief executive’s remarks provoked a welcome reaction from employees at the Sands Macao and Venetian Macao, the world’s two largest casinos.“It’s OK if we go bust, as long as another casino company will take over,” one person wrote in an anonymous online employee forum. Another added: “Even if no one is willing to do it, we will always have the government.”Las Vegas Sands is confident it will not come to that. Last week the company said it had completed a $2.1bn (€1.6bn, £1.4bn) share placement and was in talks with banks to secure project financing to restart construction in Macao.“What’s at stake in Macao is the future projects. They continue to have a good business on their existing blocks,” said one Macao banker. “They are not going to breach any loan covenants now, but they could have if they had continued with sites five and six.”At the weekend, the Venetian Macao was indeed packed with tens of thousands of customers in town for the annual Macao Grand Prix. But it was a different story across the road on its two mothballed sites, which stood largely silent. A small number of workers wandered in the shadows of incomplete superstructures. Dump trucks were loaded with construction waste as the site was prepared for a siesta that could last up to six months, if not longer.Mr Chan was one of those few workers loitering about, but not for long. Soon he will be able to sleep in as late as he wants, having been notified last week that his employment will be terminated on November 30.“Everything has stopped now. I don’t know what I will do next,” Mr Chan said, as he plotted his next move.
150;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Adelson dilutes stake in Las Vegas Sands;;Sheldon Adelson has been forced to dilute his controlling stake in Las Vegas Sands to prevent the casino owner from running out of money after agreeing to buy new shares issued in the group, which owns the Venetian casino.The company on Tuesday said it would push ahead with plans to raise $2.1bn without seeking shareholder approval.Any delay in the fundraising would “seriously jeopardise the ability to complete the offerings as well as the financial viability of the company”, it said.Under the plan, Mr Adelson will invest about $525m in new shares and warrants. Mr Adelson, once one of the world’s richest men, will also convert the $475m in convertible notes that he and his family bought recently.In all, the fundraising will generate $2.1bn for the beleaguered group, which has suspended development of casino projects in its Cotai Strip project in Macao, and will husband resources for developments in Singapore and Pennsylvania in the US.Last week, the company said it was in danger of violating loan covenants if it did not raise extra cash.Although Mr Adelson will pump extra money into the group, the size of his stake will shrink from about 67 per cent to about 50 per cent because of the large number of new shares being sold.Las Vegas Sands has been the driving force behind the development of Macao into the world’s largest gambling market.The territory’s chief executive on Tuesday said it would not allow casinos to go bust.“If necessary, the government will take over,” Edmund Ho said on Tuesday. “We will not allow any casinos to shut down.”But he said he did not expect any of the territory’s six licensed gaming operators to be pushed to the brink, despite predicting that annual casino revenues would taper off for the first time since Macao opened the market to competition six years ago.Mr Ho unveiled a 10.2bn patacas stimulus package to counter the slowdown, with investment focused on public housing, the territory’s first light rail system and other infrastructure projects. Macao will also lower personal income taxes, but is not planning a cut in the 40 per cent gaming tax imposed on casino operators.Reporting by Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles, Tom Mitchell and Justine Lau in Hong Kong and Assif Shameen in Singapore
151;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-11-10T18:58:46Z;Billionaire set to unveil new Sands financing;;Billionaire Sheldon Adelson is expected to unveil a financing package as early as this week to help prop up Las Vegas Sands, his cash-strapped gaming empire, according to people familiar with the situation.The auditor of the casino operator said last week that it had doubts about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.Sands, the owner of the Venetian Hotel and Casino, is involved in $15bn-worth of new casino projects in Macao, Singapore and the US, and has accumulated nearly $9bn in debts.Bankers and analysts familiar with the discussions on Monday said Mr Adelson, who was in Singapore last week, had held talks with several companies from Singapore, Hong Kong and other parts of Asia about investing in the listed holding company, and also the Marina Bay Sands project in Singapore and the Macao projects.In Singapore, talks have involved Kwek Leng Beng, the chairman of Hong Leong Group, which controls City Development, the listed property developer.City Development was not available for comment on Monday.Another prospective partner might be the Singapore government or its related entities.Singapore brokerage CIMB-GK said in a research report on Monday that the government might use property group CapitaLand – 40 per cent controlled by sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holding – to form a venture to take over Marina Bay Sands, the first casino resort development in the city state.Capitaland, which has been aggressively deleveraging by selling assets, on Monday denied that it had held talks with Sands but said that, in general, it might explore opportunities to invest in distressed assets.Analysts say Capitaland, which is Asia’s biggest operator of shopping malls, might be interested in just buying the huge upscale mall that Sands is building adjacent to the Singapore casino.Over the weekend, Sands scored a small victory in Singapore, where regulators are keen to see the group complete the $4.2bn Marina Bay project on time.The Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore said it would allow Sands to increase the number of gaming tables at the casino by nearly 70 per cent – from 600 tables to 1,000 tables.The project, which was originally due to open by December 2009, is reportedly running several months behind schedule.Analysts say the dramatic increase in casino capacity should make it easier for Sands to raise loans or equity.Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of the modern Singaporean state who retains the title of minister mentor, said over the weekend that the Marina Bay project would be completed even though it was “under pressure”.Joel Simkins, an analyst for Macquarie Capital in New York, said that “adding new capacity in Singapore is not going help Las Vegas Sands overcome significant balance sheets issues”.”Sands’ biggest problem is the revenue shortfall in Macao,” he said.Even if it could secure interim financing, Mr Simkins believed that it would be difficult for Sands to expand its operation in the current global economic slowdown.
152;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Las Vegas Sands seeks capital in Asia;;Sheldon Adelson, Las Vegas Sands chairman, recently met Singapore government officials concerned about completion of the company’s resort project in the city-state, according to people familiar with the discussions.The talks centred on restructuring and refinancing of the Marina Bay Sands, the first of two casino projects currently under construction in Singapore.Las Vegas Sands is trying to raise more than $2bn to fund projects in Singapore, Macao and the US. Last month it raised $475m in convertible senior stock notes from Mr Adelson and his family.In a regulatory filing on Thursday, the casino operators warned that its ability to operate as a going concern could be in doubt if it did not increase earnings or raise more capital. The filing added: “If the company is not able to obtain the requisite financing, or the terms are not as favourable as it anticipates, the company may be required to slow or suspend its global development activities.”Las Vegas Sands has built the world’s two largest casinos in Macao, which opened its market to overseas investors in 2002.Mr Adelson has been the most aggressive entrant into the Chinese special administrative region, the world’s biggest gaming market. The company secured a coveted concession in Singapore.Mr Adelson and other top Las Vegas Sands officials have met bankers in Singapore and Hong Kong in recent weeks to raise new funds. Discussions have included an array of financing instruments including convertible bonds and syndicated loans. A Las Vegas Sands spokesman could not be reached for comment on Friday.“Marina Bay Sands is a showcase project for the city-state,” said Ng Wee Siang, analyst at brokerage Westcomb. “It is highly likely that the government will step in if financing becomes a problem.”The $4.2bn Marina Bay Sands resort, which will include 2,500 hotel rooms and more than 2m sq ft of convention and retail space, is supposed to open by December 2009. Bankers say Las Vegas Sands needs to raise up to $450m to meet additional funding requirements in Singapore.Late last year Las Vegas Sands raised S$5.3bn ($3.54bn) through a syndicated loan arranged by Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Lehman Brothers.Three local banks – DBS, United Overseas Bank and OCBC – have the biggest exposure to Marina Bay Sands project with a total of S$2.2bn. Shares of the trio have fallen in recent weeks.“Global financial centres have been major conduits of debt and equity capital to Asia’s growing casino industry over the last five years and it appears this conduit is severely restricted due to the global economic situation,” said Jonathan Galaviz, an analyst at Las Vegas-based gaming and tourism consultancy Globalysis.Mr Galaviz expects Marina Bay Sands to open sometime in 2010, but believes it could struggle in the face of a global slowdown, and competition with Macao casinos.Additional reporting by Justine Lau and Tom Mitchell in Hong Kong
153;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-11-06T19:29:50Z;Debt fears hit Las Vegas Sands;Casino operator warns that it risks default;Las Vegas Sands shares fell more than 30 per cent on Thursday after the casino operator warned that it risked defaulting on its debt, raising doubts about its ability to continue operating as a going concern.The stark warning signals the severity of the downturn affecting the global gaming industry, which is suffering from falling spending at its two main centres, Las Vegas and Macao.The group, owner of The Venetian and The Palazzo in Las Vegas, as well as The Sands in Macao, is struggling to meet its debt obligations. It recently raised $475m in convertible senior stock notes from Sheldon Adelson, its largest shareholder, after earnings declined below the amount necessary to maintain debt covenants.The company said in a regulatory filing that it was continuing to look for new capital, partly because the poor earnings outlook means it is likely to breach covenants again. “If our Las Vegas earnings …do not increase sufficiently …we will need to obtain significant additional capital,” it said.Mr Adelson, one of America’s richest men, represents the company’s best hope of salvation but there is no guarantee that he will rescue the ailing casino operator. “If he does not [participate], the company may have a very difficult time getting the financing completed given its debt load, and the stock could decline significantly,” said Celeste Mellet Brown of Morgan Stanley in a research note.Failure to raise new capital would trigger a series of defaults, raising a “substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern”, the group said.The company’s plight is a far cry from its heady position a couple of years ago when it led the development of a new wave of resorts in Macao.Elsewhere in Asia, it is involved in a number of large projects, including Singapore’s first casino resort in Marina Bay.Las Vegas Sands has also been one of the most prolific developers on the Las Vegas Strip, expanding The Venetian and adding thousands of luxurious new rooms and conference facilities to its burgeoning empire in the gaming capital.But the shine has come off Las Vegas. Although visitors continue to flock to the city, they are spending less while convention business has trailed off. MGM Mirage, Las Vegas Sands’ biggest competitor, recently reported a sharp fall in revenue per available room, the key industry indicator, and also reported falling takings at table games and slot machines.Las Vegas Sands shares closed down 32.68 per cent at $7.85.
154;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-10-31T22:43:07Z;Vegas maybe;;"Who needs Las Vegas when you have these markets? Shares in the largest casino operators have lately been as heart-stoppingly unpredictable as an all-night session at the roulette table. Las Vegas Sands, down about 94 per cent this year, dropped another 30 per cent this week – and then tripled from the lows. MGM Mirage and Wynn Resorts have been on a somewhat less spectacular ride – the latter supported by its bulging balance sheet and top-notch hotels. But both rallied euphorically as the week concluded.Concerns in the desert playground for MGM and Sands were that credit constraints would make fund-raising impossible for projects, such as the multiple towers of MGM’s CityCenter on a plot bigger than 1,000 tennis courts; or even that the companies could run out of cash before punters did. Those fears are, for now, fading. MGM offered reassurance on the financing for the $9bn development and successfully, if expensively, tapped high-yield markets. In addition, the sharp economic reversal has a perk. The demise of competing projects will enable MGM to hire the 9,000 workers it needs more easily. Plummeting costs of raw materials will also help to slice building costs by about $400m.Traffic at tables and slots, though, is slowing. Gaming revenues on the Strip fell 7 per cent in the year to August, before the latest turmoil made casual gamblers sit out the next poker hand. There is the odd bright spot. An increase in third-quarter revenues per available room at MGM’s Bellagio suggests top-flight visitors are still splurging. After a spate of cancellations in September, next year’s convention schedules are apparently filling out. Valuations are beaten-down. But Wall Street’s woes and the economic slump will extinguish glimmers of recovery should the “stay at home” mentality become entrenched. Add in cutbacks on airline routes and Las Vegas’s new developments, and investors may as well stick their money on black.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

155;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-10-29T22:54:17Z;MGM Mirage reassurance boosts shares;;Shares in gaming stocks surged after MGM Mirage dispelled fears that its $9.1bn CityCenter project was facing financial difficulties and said visitors were still coming to Las Vegas in droves.MGM Mirage, owner of the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay Casinos, and Las Vegas Sands, which owns the Venetian, have been battered by concerns about the effect of the consumer slowdown on the gaming industry.Both companies have capital-intense projects to finance, which have been threatened by the shutdown in credit markets. But MGM Mirage reassured that CityCenter was on course for completion.Shares in MGM Mirage were up 33 per cent, while Las Vegas Sands rose by 80 per cent.MGM Mirage and Dubai World, its partner in CityCenter, have already provided $4bn of funding for the project, which occupies a large site in the heart of the Las Vegas strip.The companies recently secured a $1.8bn credit facility, while MGM Mirage said that it had banking commitments for an additional $500m. It also revealed it had identified $400m of savings in the project.The group is also working on a five-year, $1bn bond issue. It declined to comment on the bond or the progress of the issue, but expressed confidence about the future of CityCenter.“Our models are based on us not putting another penny into this,” Terry Lanni, chief executive, told the Financial Times. “Whatever else we get [from lenders] will be a benefit.”Las Vegas has been hit hard by the US economic slowdown. Airlines have reduced the number of flights into the city and visitors are spending less.However, MGM Mirage’s resort casinos are still full. “We have 95 per cent occupancy, so people are still coming,” said Mr Lanni, although he added that spend per visitor had fallen.Third-quarter revenues slipped from $2.07bn to $1.95bn. Net income fell from $183.9m to $61.3m, reflecting a $30m writedown related to the Primm Valley Golf Club.
156;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-10-05T18:48:07Z;Gambling industry holds weak hand as downturn bites;;When a man like Sheldon Adelson, one of the richest in America, has to pour $475m of his family’s money into his casino empire to tide things over, it is time for the gambling industry to worry.The majority owner of Las Vegas Sands, whose assets include the Venetian and the Palazzo on the Strip, made the move to prevent breaching banking covenants last week.Mr Adelson is up to his neck in new casino projects – $12bn is being sunk into new resorts in Macao, $4bn into one in Singapore. “Had the availability of money been more plentiful, we would have gone out and borrowed,” he explained.But the lack of available credit is just one of his problems. Las Vegas aficionados have always gone to the gambling mecca to forget their worries, but a fall in consumer spending combined with the crisis in the credit markets means the city now has some significant worries of its own.Gambling revenues at the city’s casinos on the Strip are plummeting as cash-strapped punters keep their hands in their pockets: latest quarterly figures for MGM Mirage, the biggest operator in Las Vegas with casinos such as the Bellagio and the Mirage, show a 10 per cent fall in revenues from table games and an 11 per cent fall in slot machine revenues.Four casino operators have sought bankruptcy protection this year, including Tropicana Entertainment, which defaulted on $2.67bn of bank debt. Other operators have postponed big developments. Boyd Gaming has shelved plans for Echelon, a $4.8bn project on the Strip while it tries to secure new sources of financing.A $5bn Plaza Hotel development has also been delayed by at least a year. The developers Elad, which owns the Plaza Hotel in New York, and IDB, an Israeli company, have deferred payment of a $625m loan used to buy the Las Vegas site.The problems facing operators have taken the shine off the city’s image as recession-proof. Previous economic downturns have not been as keenly felt in the city but the current slump is having a pronounced affect.But even when this slump is over, there are longer-term worries. Land-based casinos have become “a growing energy problem”, said Warwick Bartlett, a UK-based gaming consultant.Half of Las Vegas’ visitors arrive by air. The rest come by car or coach. To keep Las Vegas powered will require a daily average of 8,000 megawatts of electricity by 2015, way beyond the output of the Hoover Dam.“The slowdown in the US will hit the pockets of Americans and Las Vegas will feel the effect of that, along with high energy costs and a transportation system reliant on road and air,” Mr Bartlett said.The impact is also being felt in the jobs market. MGM Mirage and Harrah’s Entertainment, which owns Caesars Palace, cut jobs this year, and jobs have been cut at the Las Vegas Department of Building and Safety.The slump has been exacerbated by capacity issues. The city has more hotel rooms than at any point in its history, with aggressive expansion fuelled by cheap and easily available credit.Las Vegas could afford to expand while punters still beat a path to the city. But economic woes mean there are fewer people visiting, while all-important convention businesses has also slowed.All this helps the online gambling industry, in spite of its ban in the US. “People are leaving their cars in the garage, playing online bingo or watching a match on TV and placing a bet from the comfort of an armchair,” Mr Bartlett said.
157;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-10-02T09:33:45Z;Adelson pours own money into LVS;;Sheldon Adelson poured $475m of his family’s money into Las Vegas Sands, the gaming company of which he is the majority owner, in an attempt to strengthen its liquidity during the global financial crisis.The move late on Tuesday came on the day the operator of the Venetian and the Palazzo resort casinos in Las Vegas faced a deadline for meeting loan covenants.LVS shares on Wednesday fell 13 per cent to close at $31.32.Mr Adelson, the LVS chairman and chief executive, said in a press release that the investment would help the company advance developments in the US and abroad.“While the credit markets are experiencing turbulence, our strategy remains alive and well and our business continues to march forward,” Mr Adelson said.“Little of our fundamental business strategy has changed and this investment will strengthen our capitalisation and liquidity position as we continue to execute our plans.”LVS has development projects totalling nearly $17bn, including a $12bn complex in Macao, and the $4bn Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. In Asia, it already operates the Sands Macau and Venetian Macau.The Adelson family bought convertible senior notes at 6.5 per cent cash interest. The notes are convertible into common stock at $49.65 per share and mature on October 1, 2013. Mr Adelson also made a $50m capital injection to LVS’s Las Vegas operations, which include the Sands Expo and Convention Center.Mr Adelson on Wednesday told Reuters: “Had the availability of money been more plentiful, we would have gone out and borrowed. This way, I am minimising the dilution to shareholders.”According to Robin Farley, analyst with UBS, negotiations are continuing for an extra $5.3bn credit facility for the Macao development, with $2bn needed to finish construction in time for its scheduled opening in the second quarter of next year, and the remainder for refinancing existing debt.LVS was “not out of the woods yet”, the analyst said.Mr Adelson told Reuters he preferred to keep the Macao debt terms in place rather than renegotiate a new package.Shares in LVS have taken a battering this year, falling nearly 70 per cent, as US consumers give up Las Vegas vacations, partly because of spending pressures, but in particular because higher fuel prices are making trips to the casino resorts more expensive.LVS is also building a casino resort development in Pennsylvania, due to open next year.
158;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-09-21T17:53:22Z;Gamble pays off for Ho as SJM profits rise 8%;;Last week, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, the gaming flagship of tycoon Stanley Ho, issued its first set of results as a publicly traded company, recording an 8 per cent increase in first-half net profit to HK$571m ($73m). In doing so Mr Ho adhered to one of the cardinal rules of corporate reporting – do not disappoint the market.In spite of a 4.5 per cent year-on-year fall in revenues, SJM slightly exceeded the profit guidance it gave investors ahead of the company’s July initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange.It did help that SJM’s targets were modest to begin with. The company’s revenue and profit both fell in the three years prior to its listing, and it did not promise a miraculous turnround upon listing. Mr Ho may have waited almost 50 years to submit his gaming operations to public scrutiny – he was first given monopoly rights to the then Portuguese colony’s gambling sector in 1962 – but the 86-year-old tycoon has clearly mastered the art of managing expectations.By the time Mr Ho finally brought his company to market, completing a tortuous three-year process, the honeymoon was clearly over for the Macaogaming market.The industry had experienced a renaissance after Mr Ho’s monopoly lapsed in 2002 and five new entrants, led by Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts of the US, were given concessions. This year first-half gaming revenues in the tiny enclave, which has a population of 540,000 and reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1999, increased 55 per cent to 59.3bn patacas ($7.3bn), exceeding its two next largest rivals – the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City, New Jersey – combined.However, during the past year the Chinese government has become increasingly concerned about the strains that the sector’s explosive growth is putting on Macao’s labour market and infrastructure. Public frustration at inflation and other stresses boiled over during last year’s May Day holiday, when the previously quiescent territory was shocked by rowdy street protests.In an effort to calm the industry’s torrid growth, the Chinese government has recently restricted the frequency and ease with which mainland gamblers can visit Macao, contributing to a run on Macao casino stocks. SJM’s shares have fallen by more than 50 per cent in their first two months of trading.Macao, in turn, has extended a freeze on new concessions that was set to expire next year and indicated that it would cap the commissions payable to junkets, who ferry high-rolling VIP “whales” to the territory, probably at 1.25 per cent of chip sales. VIP gamblers still account for 70 per cent of Macao’s gaming revenues, in spite of expectations that liberalisation would transform the territory into more of a mass-market-dependent resort and convention destination.In a statement accompanying SJM’s results, Mr Ho cited the challenges of “increasing competition and tightened restrictions on travel to Macao from mainland China”.Francis Lui, vice-chairman of Hong Kong-listed Galaxy Entertainment, another concession holder, said: “China quite rightly wants sustainable growth [in Macao].“We have been paying [junkets] more than 1.25 per cent and welcome a cap [on commissions].”Reflecting more difficult market conditions, Galaxy last week reported a 15 per cent decline in revenues. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 50 per cent to HK$356m. Galaxy, which last year sold a 20 per cent stake to Permira private equity firm of the UK for $838m, has experienced four quarter-on-quarter declines running in ebitda.
159;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-08-17T16:35:08Z;Singapore property set for a fall;;Singapore has taken on the appearance of a vast building site. Old apartment blocks are being torn down to make way for futuristic condominiums, including one in the shape of a huge sail. A new financial district in central Singapore is rising next to the city-state’s first casino resort complex, to be operated by Las Vegas Sands.The boom in construction, which rose 17 per cent between April and June, reflects a recent surge in property prices, including a 70 per cent increase in homes since 2005. Residential and office rents also jumped nearly 70 per cent last year. Prime office rentals are now the highest in Asia, beating traditional leaders Tokyo and Hong Kong, according to Colliers International.But, having reached stratospheric heights, the property market looks set to hit some turbulence that could produce an equally significant fall.There are increasing signs that property prices have peaked. New home sales have slowed significantly, with residential prices rising only 0.17 per cent in the second quarter. Increases in office rents are tapering off at a similar rate.Developers are reporting lower profits for the second quarter as the property market cools. City Developments, Singapore’s biggest private property group, last Thursday reported a 15 per cent drop in earnings. CapitaLand and Keppel Land, the two big state-owned developers, have announced profit falls of 43.5 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. Meanwhile, Singapore’s FTSE property share index has fallen 35.2 per cent from its peak last October.Liew Mun Leong, CapitaLand’s chief executive, partly blamed the earnings fall on “the moderation in the price increase for the Singapore property market,” adding that the outlook for the high-end market would “probably be very flat”.Singapore has suffered similar boom-bust property cycles before owing to the peculiarities of the market. With nearly 90 per cent of Singaporeans living in state-subsidised apartments, the fate of the private residential sector has rested on a rather small customer base of well-off local and foreign investors.Just a few years ago, Singapore had one of the most anaemic property markets in the world. In an effort to boost the sluggish construction sector, the government in 2005 eased lending rules to encourage developers to replace old apartment blocks with new ones. The resulting destruction of housing stock created an artificial shortage that drove up rents and triggered a wave of property speculation.Office rents also climbed owing to a shortage of space as Singapore’s ambitions to attract private banks and asset management firms proved successful. Predictions that more foreigners would move to Singapore added to the optimism about the market’s future.But the global credit crunch and rising construction costs are now taking their toll, with a slowing economy and falling share prices undermining confidence.But demand is drying up. Many are struggling to meet mortgage payments as rents begin to fall as a result of the increased supply of new apartments. Citigroup estimates luxury property prices could fall 20-30 per cent from their peak as speculators unload properties. Office rents are also due for a correction. Companies are relocating from the expensive central business district to more affordable areas.Chua Yang Liang, Singapore research head for Jones Lang LaSalle, the property consultancy, believes the city-state will probably avoid the property market collapse that occurred in 1997 with the Asian financial crisis. He expects Singapore will suffer a moderate downturn similar to that in 2003 when the outbreak of the Sars disease depressed demand.“Developers are better able to stabilise the market than previously, since the big ones now have the financial capacity to delay new [residential] launches to prevent supply excess while low interest rates are expected to support demand,” he says, predicting a recovery from 2010.
160;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-07-16T10:02:33Z;SJM debut dips in line with expectations;;Macao tycoon Stanley Ho’s gaming flagship finally made its stock market debut on Wednesday, dipping below its offering price in Hong Kong trade after overcoming a last-minute legal challenge.The debut for SJM Holdings, which raised $494 million in a scaled-back share sale amid a poor market, comes as the casino operator struggles to compete with aggressive US operators led by Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts.Ho’s Sociedade de Jogos de Macau has seen its market share of Macau’s $15 billion gaming market, the world’s largest, shrink to 40 per cent from 75 per cent three years ago, with more competition on the way and costs for labour and construction materials on the rise.The stock ended the morning session down 1.6 per cent at HK$3.03, below its HK$3.08 IPO price, which was at the bottom of an indicated range. The lacklustre performance was in line with market expectations.Hong Kong’s Court of Appeal dismissed an application for a judicial review launched by Winnie Ho, Mr Ho’s estranged sister, that sought to derail the $494m listing of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (SJM) by the casino tycoon.“In my judgment, none of the challenges sought …in the judicial review proceedings could be reasonably arguable,” Chief Justice Ma said on Tuesday.Ms Ho’s lawsuit had previously prompted SJM to delay its initial public offering by a week and to give retail investors until last Friday to return shares they had bought in return for a full refund.SJM said about 55 per cent of individual investors had withdrawn applications, which accounted for 146.99m shares. The retail tranche accounts for 15 per cent of the global offering.Even some SJM employees withdrew their share allocations, representing about 3.2 per cent of the shares they had sought.All the unwanted shares have been reallocated to the institutional portion of the offering. The withdrawal left the initial public offering undersubscribed by 102.87m shares.Deutsche Bank, the IPO’s bookrunner, has stepped in to make up the $40.7m shortfall. The bank has entered into derivatives transactions with a number of investors who will take on the economic benefits and exposure to the shares.SJM is selling 25 per cent of its shares for $494m, less than half the $1bn it had originally planned to raise in January. That attempt had to be postponed after the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong’s market regulator, sought more information about Ms Ho’s long-running dispute with her brother – which has given rise to more than 30 lawsuits in Macao and Hong Kong courts.Undeterred by Tuesday’s failure, Ms Ho said she planned to take her case to Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal. Even though SJM is finally able to get its long delayed listing off the ground, the company is expected to face other challenges.SJM lost its 40-year monopoly of Macao’s gaming market in 2002 and its share of casino revenue plunged to 40 per cent last year because of intense competition.The company also faces shrinking margins and labour shortages.Additional reporting by Tom Mitchell in Hong Kong
161;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-07-10T22:58:50Z;Wynn eyes HK listing for Macao growth;;Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas gaming magnate, is laying the groundwork for a possible listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange as he seeks funding for project development in Macao.Nasdaq-listed Wynn Resorts has mandated UBS, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank for the offering, according to people familiar with the company’s plans. However, they warned that the timing and fundraising target of a Hong Kong listing was impossible to predict given turbulent market conditions.“It is early days, but if it does get away we are looking at Wynn raising between $500m and $1bn from a [Hong Kong] listing,” one person said.Wynn is one of six licensed casino operators in Macao, the Chinese special administrative region and the world’s largest gambling market. In the first quarter of this year, Macao casino revenues grew more than 60 per cent to $3.7bn – bigger than its two nearest rivals, the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City in the US, combined.Wynn would be the second Macao casino company to tap funds in Hong Kong this year, following next week’s debut of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau. Controlled by Stanley Ho, SJM enjoyed a monopoly over Macao’s gaming market until 2002, when it was opened to outside competitors including Wynn and Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands.SJM has struggled to get its offering, led by Deutsche, off the ground, in spite of reducing its offer size from $1bn, set in January, to $494m this month. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index has fallen more than 30 per cent since its high last October.In spite of the local gaming market’s growth, Macao casinos are contending with a host of challenges, from rapid capacity build-out to higher labour costs and commissions for so-called “junkets”, which lure high-rolling VIP gamblers to the territory.Reacting to these pressures, Edmund Ho, the territory’s chief executive, extended a moratorium on new licences in April and said his administration would freeze land grants for new casino developments.Wynn operates the $1.1bn Wynn Macau and is scheduled to begin construction of its second casino in the territory, the Wynn Cotai, by the end of next year.Wynn, UBS, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche declined to comment on Thursday.

163;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-04-24T02:35:07Z;Macao casino move cheers markets;;"The Macao government’s decision, announced on Tuesday, to rein back rapid growth in the world’s largest gaming market has been a long time in the making.Edmund Ho, chief executive of the Chinese special administrative region, said his government would – among other measures – extend a moratorium on the number of licensed casino operators in the territory, halt land allocations for new gaming investments and restrict expansion plans at existing casinos.Revealed at an otherwise routine question-and-answer session with Macao legislators, Mr Ho’s shot across the bow initially shocked the market, then cheered it. Share prices of US and Hong Kong-listed companies with gaming interests in Macao surged on the news.“It stops unfettered competition,” said one industry executive, who is nonetheless anxious to see the fine print from Mr Ho. “People can’t just come in and set up casinos. It will drive profitability per table up.”The growth of Macao’s casino industry has surged in recent months, especially noticeable in a city with a population of just 500,000. In the first quarter of this year gaming revenues increased more than 60 per cent year on year to $3.72bn – more than the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City combined.“We have to ensure our continued economic growth – but also resolve the new problems that have arisen as a result of [it],” Mr Ho said.“This move reflects the Macao government’s concerns – and probably also Beijing’s – about the side-effects of the gambling boom,” says Au Kam-san, a pro-democracy legislator who has long been critical of Mr Ho’s administration. “The gaming industry’s explosive growth has already exceeded the capacity of Macao’s limited resources.”The Macao government’s angst can be traced back to early last year when Jorge Oliveira, an influential policy official at the territory’s gaming commission, e-mailed senior casino executives the March cover article from Macau Business, an English-language monthly magazine. The article’s headline was unambiguous: “The Game’s Up: Revenue sharing threatens the system; Gov moves to block new players”.At that time Macao had just eclipsed the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s largest gambling market, vindicating the government’s decision five years earlier to terminate tycoon Stanley Ho’s monopoly in the industry. Five players were ushered in including Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, which has opened the world’s two largest casinos in the territory, Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts and MGM Mirage, which formed a joint venture with Mr Ho’s daughter, Pansy.But all was not well in Macao. The government was worried about “revenue sharing” or “franchise” agreements, under which outside parties piggy-backed off the licences of established players. Mr Ho’s gaming flagship, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, had pioneered these arrangements, running casinos for partners who bore most of the properties’ investment risk.Although typically involving businessmen and companies little-known outside Hong Kong and Macao, bigger fish were beginning to surface as well. In January of last year, Sir Richard Branson told the FT the Virgin Group intended to open a $3bn Macao gaming resort in co-operation with a licensed casino operator.Sir Richard’s public enthusiasm was the final straw for Macao government regulators. “That was probably not the best way to do business in China,” says one person familiar with Virgin’s approach. For its part, Virgin says it is still exploring opportunities in the territory.The Macao government’s skittishness was aggravated by anti-government protests on May 1 last year – the largest since the former Portuguese colony reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1999 – as people complained the boom had left them behind. In his remarks on Tuesday, Ed­mund Ho said the government would pay every Macao resident 5,000 patacas ($625) from its overflowing fiscal surplus – a sop that could damp turn-out at next week’s May Day march.Further illustrating the stress the casino industry is putting on Macao’s social and physical infrastructure, the Venetian Macao – the world’s largest casino – opened in August with 15,000 employees, 5 per cent of the territory’s workforce. When William Weidner, Las Vegas Sands president, spoke of his new property as “the casino that ate Macao”, his joke struck some as being too close to the bone.In this context, Edmund Ho’s announcement was perhaps inevitable. But as one senior casino executive says: “The government must get the new regulations out quickly so the industry knows what they are talking about. So far it’s only been a lot of froth.”"
164;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Macao curbs gaming;;The odds suddenly look a lot better for casino operators who took a punt on Macao, the world’s biggest gambling den. On Tuesday the government unveiled plans to extend a moratorium on new casino licences and stop doling out land for gaming developments.The move delighted investors in US gaming companies: shares in Las Vegas Sands surged 9 per cent on Tuesday, while Wynn Resorts jumped 7 per cent. The new rules play right into the hands of existing operators. Although they are technically subject to the new restrictions it is unclear how much will be grandfathered: expansion under discussion is unlikely to be halted. But newcomers, including hopefuls such as Sir Richard Branson, will not make it over the starting line. That leaves a lot of growth for a small club of players. Macao, the only part of China where gambling is legal, chalked up a 62 per cent rise in revenues to $3.7bn in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis.But government restrictions are only part of the story. Inadequate infrastructure, for example, is already posing a constraint on growth. The social consequences of turning a once sleepy village into one large casino add to the mix: frustration spilled out into anti-government protests last year. Even the market is signalling tentative signs of oversupply. Not all the spanking-new casinos are heaving with punters. Some ambitions have been trimmed. Overall, the number of gaming tables fell on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the first quarter, a rare occurrence. Las Vegas Sands’ year-on-year revenue at its older resort fell in the fourth quarter. And at least one would-be player appears to have lost out from the new curbs. Harrah’s Entertainment, which last year shelled out heavily for a Macao golf course, will have to drop any thoughts of building a casino there, for now. A few (hideously expensive) rounds of golf look like poor compensation.Post and read comments on this Lex
165;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-04-23T10:01:36Z;Macao to limit casino growth;;Macao is to rein in the growth of its gambling industry by extending a moratorium on the issue of new casino licences and freezing land allocations for the construction of gaming developments.In the first quarter of this year, gaming revenues in the territory soared 62 per cent year-on-year to $3.72bn – exceeding the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City’s revenues combined.Edmund Ho, Macao chief executive, told legislators about steps the Chinese special administrative region would use to address a backlash and ease concerns of Beijing politicians.They include a freeze on land allocations for future casino developments that could affect some projects planned by the six companies currently allowed to operate gaming establishments in the territory. Mr Ho also said a government moratorium on the number of casino operators, which is due to expire next year, would remain in place “for the foreseeable future”.The news sent shares of Galaxy Entertainment up 13 per cent and Melco International Development up 5.5 per cent in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Australia’s Crown, with which Melco has a joint venture, rose 5.5 per cent in Sydney.The territory’s casino industry was opened to overseas investment in 2002, ending the 40-year monopoly enjoyed by Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong-born Eurasian tycoon who is not related to Edmund Ho. The liberalisation led to a flood of investment from the likes of Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Mirage. Stanley Ho’s Sociedade de Jogos de Macau hit back with the launch of a flagship property, the Grand Lisboa.Macao’s established casino operators have already locked in government approvals for their future projects, most of which are already under construction.The amount of investment in new casinos has badly strained Macao’s social and physical infrastructure. Parents fret about the number of students dropping out of school to take dealer positions, which are reserved for local residents. Government departments, banks and even dentist offices are also finding it difficult to hold on to their staff.Macao’s government has struggled to contain the backlash, which erupted during anti-government protests on May 1 last year.In an effort to mollify critics who say that most of the population have not shared in the wealth created by the boom, Edmund Ho announced that the government would give every Macao permanent resident a cash payment of 5,000 patacas ($625) from its fiscal surplus.
166;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-02-26T18:00:29Z;Government buries plans for supercasinos;;Casinos will have to close their doors for six hours a day, the government has announced, as it formally buried plans for supercasinos in Britain.Andy Burnham, the culture secretary, did give the go-ahead for 16 smaller casinos in towns such as Leeds, Milton Keynes and Newham in east London, but told MPs there were concerns about the “negative impact” of a Las Vegas-style resort in Manchester.The eight large-sized and eight small-sized casinos he approved did not “pose the same level of risk”, as the supercasino, Mr Burnham told MPs.But they would still have to provide “non-gambling areas”, and must introduce a series of new restrictions on opening hours, a move that the government hopes will kill off the notion that it was introducing 24-hour gambling in the UK.The new regime, which includes already announced restrictions, such as banning the practice of giving customers free drinks and allowing them to use credit cards to purchase chips or play slot machines, created the “toughest regulatory controls for gambling in the world”, Mr Burnham said.The culture secretary added he was disappointed at the level of contributions made by licensed operators to the Responsibility in Gambling Trust, which helps problem gamblers, and said he would introduce a statutory levy unless those contributions increased substantially by the end of the year.Gordon Brown launched a review in July of Tony Blair’s policy to liberalise the UK casino market partly in order to regenerate deprived parts of the UK.At one stage, US operators such as MGM Mirage and Las Vegas Sands courted local and national politicians in the expectation that up to 40 supercasinos would be built in the UK.But a media backlash, coupled with the prime minister’s own reservations about encouraging gambling, has seen the policy rapidly scaled down.A report on Tuesday from the communities and local government department said the benefits from casino-led regeneration were not much different from “alternative, but equally effective projects”, such as retail, commercial and housing development.These projects did not carry with them “the specific social costs associated with problem gambling”, the DCLG report said.Manchester city council, which estimated the supercasino would have created 3,500 jobs in the deprived east Manchester area, said it would examine the government’s announcements in detail before deciding whether to launch a judicial review over its decision not to proceed with the supercasino.Manchester was awarded the supercasino by an independent advisory panel, beating off favourites Blackpool and Greenwich, but MPs voted against it following sustained anti-gambling campaigns by religious groups and parts of the media.The government sought to soften the blow for Manchester by announcing a series of regeneration measures, including £10m funding from English Partnerships, the national regeneration agency, for sports venues in the city.The large regional casinos will be allowed to provide up to 150 slot machines offering jackpots of up to £4,000. They have been approved in Leeds, Southampton, Great Yarmouth, Middlesbrough, Solihull, Hull, Milton Keynes and Newham.Smaller casinos have been approved in Somerset, Dumfries and Galloway, Scarborough, Wolverhampton, Swansea, Luton, Torbay and East Lindsey.The 16 were chosen by the same panel that chose Manhcester for the ill-fated supercasino.
167;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-02-13T22:02:59Z;Airbus in talks to create A380 casino;;High-rolling gamblers may soon be cashing in their chips with the great casino in the sky.Airbus has been approached by potential Asian buyers who are looking to turn its A380 “superjumbo” aircraft into a flying casino, says the European aircraft-maker.François Chazelle, who heads the Airbus executive and private aviation division, said: “Discussions are under way, and not just with casino operators.” Should the talks lead to an order soon, a fully-fitted casino A380 could be delivered between 2012 and 2017, he said.“This [gambling] is clearly a growing business in Asia and what this interest reflects is what is happening in Macao and Singapore,” he said. “The idea of a flying casino has been mentioned before but it’s now looking a lot more concrete.”Macao has overtaken Las Vegas as the world’s biggest gaming centre, while Singapore is planning to open its first casino next year.However, there are strict curbs, or outright casino bans, on gambling in much of Asia, including Thailand and mainland China. Nevertheless, operators have long offered gambling-boat cruises out of cities such as Hong Kong into international waters.Mr Chazelle said the legal loophole aspect was “certainly a factor but I think it is more about the attraction of being able to offer such an extraordinary activity”. He said the A380 was the first aircraft large enough for a full-fledged casino operation. “If this could have worked before, I’m sure it would have,” he said.The Airbus talks also follow recent reports that US gaming operator Sands is planning an air link between its Venetian casinos in Las Vegas and Macao that will allow passengers to play baccarat on two private jets. Mr Chazelle would not name possible casino clients for the A380 and whether Sands was among them.Contacted on Wednesday, Macao-based gaming executives said they were not aware that any of the territory’s six licensed operators had entered discussions to purchase a flying casino. “It would give ‘fiscal flight’ a whole new meaning,” said one sceptical casino executive, who noted potential government concerns that aerial gaming would be unregulated and untaxed.Daniel Lehnberg, business development manager for the Asia Pacific Poker Tour, which last year arranged Macao’s first Texas Hold’em tournament, said governments would most probably want to enforce new laws if flying casinos were to develop.Additional reporting by Tom Mitchell
168;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-02-11T18:54:25Z;Europe’s saplings need financial fertiliser;;"After recent financial turmoil, it would be tempting for European policymakers to rein in the scope of financial innovation – tempting, but misguided. On the contrary, the current focus on financial stability must go hand in hand with a renewed policy impetus to improve the European financial system’s ability to foster enterprise growth.A look at the world’s largest companies offers both comfort and concern. On the face of it, Europe holds its ground well. Its share of the FT Global 500’s market value has increased over the past five years and now reaches 32 per cent, while the US share has plummeted from 57 per cent to 38 per cent. But, in contrast with the US and most other economies, Europe’s champions are ageing giants. Only 12 out of the 154 European companies in the ranking were created after 1950. Among US companies, those born after 1950 number 51 out of 174. Europe has a prosperous stock of established large companies, but does a dismal job of grooming new ones.One reason is that Europe lacks the high-powered innovation ecosystems that generate the Microsofts, Genentechs and Googles of this world. But among US companies now worth more than $20bn and born in the past half-century, high-technology companies remain a minority. Apart from a few energy companies, most of the rest are service innovators: the likes of FedEx, Carnival Cruises, Las Vegas Sands, retailers such as Wal-Mart or Home Depot, media outfits and financial services companies. Technological innovation, while crucial, is not the only factor driving the continuous emergence of new giants in the US. Others are the size of its domestic market, especially for services, where Europe remains fragmented; the flexibility of its labour market; and the higher cultural and social status of entrepreneurs.But an additional factor is often overlooked: the American finance industry offers more support for the growth of emerging companies than its European counterpart. Economic research in the past 20 years has firmly established that financial development is not only a consequence, but also a cause, of economic growth. Efficient financial systems enable the allocation of capital to businesses and entrepreneurs with the highest growth potential.Europe’s recent financial development has been impressive but remains unbalanced. The continent’s large companies can now rely on deep, liquid and efficient capital markets. But every available indicator suggests that emerging enterprises benefit from a wider range of appropriate financing solutions in the US than in Europe.Private equity comes first to mind. Beyond it, many credit offerings, such as high-yield bonds, mezzanine loans and other subordinated debt instruments are well suited to high-growth service businesses that can pledge no tangible assets as collateral. The markets for these financial products remain comparatively underdeveloped in Europe, especially outside the UK and Nordic countries.Moreover, corporate finance for mid-sized businesses is a proximity business: it must reach the companies where they are and it requires the intensive use of local information. The concentration of a very efficient finance industry in a few places cannot be a substitute for widespread financial development.This important factor in economic growth remains a blind spot of policy. The European Union’s much-heralded Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs has 24 “integrated guidelines”, but none specifically touches the financial system. The reasons may be found in the political economy of Europe’s post-war economies, when capital scarcity was the norm and the financial sector was managed under tight state control.A new impetus is needed to make Europe’s financial system more supportive of emerging enterprises. The times for direct provision of financing by governments, through co-investment or public guarantees, are largely gone. Instead, policy initiatives should focus on creating a level playing field with the right incentives for market players. Much could be achieved with a mix of assertive competition policy, less prescriptive securities regulation in markets reserved for professional investors, a Europe-wide effort to simplify and harmonise insolvency procedures, the elimination of tax distortions between financial instruments and an evolution of prudential rules to encourage investment in emerging companies. Many levers are at national level, but a concerted effort by the EU’s member states would maximise the chances of success.In the current turmoil, policymakers must keep their eye on the ball. Europe’s priority remains higher long-term growth and that means entrepreneurial new companies. The financial crisis will inevitably result in a rash of initiatives and regulations: in their discussion, all should remember that what Europe needs is more private equity for growth and expansion, more venture capital, a liquid market for high-yield bonds and more sophisticated and competitive corporate finance offerings.Policy responses to the perils of instability should not put a heavy lid on those financial innovations that are necessary to improve Europe’s growth potential. From an economic and political point of view, Europe’s financial system must be improved so that more young sprouts can grow and challenge Europe’s tall old corporate trees.The writers, respectively assistant professor of finance at NYU Stern School of Business and research fellow at Bruegel, are the authors of Financing Europe’s Fast Movers (www.bruegel.org)"
169;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Learn how to read writing on the wall;;Things are simpler than they appear. I’ll give you an example. Let’s say you want to beat your family at Scrabble. You have two choices. You can read every book you can find, build an enormous vocabulary and look up the definitions of words you don’t know to defeat all opponents. Or you can remember the following five words: “xi”, “xu”, “za”, “qi”, and “qat”. “Ka” and “ki” are not so bad, either. And every now and then “aa”, “ae”, and “ai” can prove incredibly useful. These are all legal words in the last edition of the official Scrabble dictionary.What do they mean? I have no idea. You don’t need to know. Somehow, “za” is slang for “pizza”. I’ve never heard of that before. Apparently it’s used on the West Coast but I’ve never heard anyone from there say “za”. I’m told people from Trenton, New Jersey, use the phrase “tomato pies” instead of “pizza” but I grew up 20 minutes from Trenton and never heard anyone use that phrase, either. Some things are mysteries and are best ignored.But once you are OK with the fact that “xu” is a word, it means you can slap down that “X” on a triple-letter score with much greater ease than your opponents thought possible. While they are all stuck with their Qs and Zs, you’re racking up 50-point, two-letter words and winning the game.The same goes for poker. Do you want to know how you can beat your friends? Never bluff. When you have a good hand, bet and raise everyone. Someone out there will think you’re bluffing and pay you off. Meanwhile, if you don’t have a good hand, just fold. Expect to play two hands an hour in a casual game with friends. And take all their money.I taught my eight-year-old daughter how to play poker the other day. Since I’m dead-set against the idea of her going to college, I figure she might as well get some skills as a gambler. Every time she’s about to lie during the game, she looks to the left. When I told her she did that she then sometimes looked to the left on purpose to make me think she was lying. That’s called “controlling your opponent” – when you tell them something and then they try to use that information against you, but you know in advance they will do that. She became a fool two times over and had no chance, while I took all her money. But it was a learning experience for her.(Although as a wise shaman once told me: “Show me a learning experience and I’ll show you a loser.” Actually, it was my wife, a former flyweight Golden Gloves champion, and I happened to be the loser, but that’s another story.)While we’re on the subject of gambling, you don’t have to be a brain surgeon to know that, regardless of the economy, more people will be gambling next year than last year.It’s been like that since the beginning of time. Casino revenues have gone from $15bn in 1995 to $32bn last year, with no down years in between, in spite of the recession of 2001. More casinos are being built in Las Vegas and around the country as laws are being relaxed. Macao in China has replaced Las Vegas as the world leader in gambling revenues, and that trend is only going to get bigger with a rising middle-class there. So it becomes easy. Buy casinos.But let’s make it even easier. Las Vegas Sands is one of the largest holdings of the Marsico Focus Fund, which has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years by an average of 6.3 per cent a year. LVS also happens to own the Sands Macao casino. I also like the fact that Thornburg Value Fund (another firm that has beaten the S&P 500 by over 6 per cent a year over the past 10 years) also owns LVS. Gambling is a huge trend and two great funds own it. Check!Let’s go in through the back door. Every casino being built needs slot machines. Who makes the slot machines? The world leader is International Game Technology. Its income has risen for the past nine years, from $65m in 1999 to $508m in 2007. Need to make this decision simpler? I like the fact that Private Capital, run by Bruce Sherman, is one of its largest shareholders. Private Capital has the claim to fame that it has probably been an investor in more companies bought by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway than any other fund.It doesn’t take detailed knowledge of string theory to appreciate a sunset. And “ka”, in addition to being a word that babies sometimes use, is also the Egyptian mythology definition of the human soul. Don’t try to make things overly complicated to fool people into thinking you’re smart. Just make things as easy as possible and try to enjoy the day.james@formulacapital.com
170;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-01-15T18:21:22Z;Lisboa’s end marks a new beginning;;Stanley Ho, the Macao gaming tycoon, did something this month that he had previously refused to even contemplate. His gaming flagship, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, announced on January 2 that it would tear down the Lisboa hotel and casino.Completed in 1970 and immortalised four years later when it was featured in a James Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun, the Lisboa and its roulette-wheel design have long been synonymous with both Mr Ho and Macao, which in 2006 eclipsed the Las Vegas strip as the world’s largest gaming market.The decision to redevelop the 12-storey landmark casino was motivated by more than economics – the Lisboa could be replaced by a much taller tower. Coming just weeks before SJM’s planned $1bn initial public offering in Hong Kong, it also symbolised a break with Macao’s past and a new beginning for the company.Macao, a former Portuguese colony which reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1999, has only recently begun to shed its reputation as a sleazy, triad-infested den of iniquity – an image that has rendered Mr Ho, who has long denied having any links to the territory’s underworld, persona non grata in the eyes of many overseas gaming regulators.Macao’s image began to change for the better this decade following the entry of five new casino operators.The new entrants, including Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Mirage of the US and Australia’s Publishing and Broadcasting (now known as Consolidated Media Holdings), have invested billions of dollars in nine new casinos since Mr Ho’s 40-year gaming monopoly was scrapped in 2002.SJM, which operates 18 casinos owned by its parent, Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau, is undergoing an equally radical overhaul, with potentially important consequences for Mr Ho’s sprawling family.The tycoon, who recently celebrated his 86th birthday and is estimated to have a fortune worth more than $7bn, has fathered at least 17 children by four wives.“This is as much about succession planning as it is about the IPO,” says one person involved in the transaction. “Ho’s own legacy is complete. He’s more worried about his children.”Including SJM, Mr Ho and his family have interests in three of Macao’s six gaming concessions. Mr Ho’s heir apparent and daughter from his second marriage, Pansy, has partnered with MGM Mirage in an independent capacity. Lawrence, Pansy’s younger brother, has a joint venture with James Packer’s CMH.Rounding out this complicated set of Ho family dynamics is the tycoon’s fourth wife and mother of his five youngest children, Angela Leong.Ms Leong, who is just two years older than Pansy, is a director at SJM, which would appear to put her in pole position to take over the helm at the most lucrative operation in her husband’s business empire.While neither Pansy nor Lawrence have any direct ties to SJM, Ms Ho is an STDM director and also managing director of her father’s transportation and property arm, Shun Tak Holdings.MGM Mirage initially considered partnering with Shun Tak, but was dissuaded by regulatory concerns in its home market.“The regulators in the US frowned on that, especially in Nevada,” Terry Lanni, MGM Mirage chairman and chief executive, recalled in an interview before last month’s opening of the $1.25bn MGM Grand Macau.“Nevada didn’t think it would be appropriate because of the ownership that Dr Ho has in [Shun Tak] …They just made it very clear to us that he was an individual we could not do business with.”Ms Ho, who owes the bulk of her net worth to her father, has had to reassure US regulators that he has no influence over her partnership with MGM Mirage.“Rich fathers tend to give money to their kids,” Mr Lanni said. “I mean, who else would they give it to? [Nevada regulators] asked her: do you expect to receive any more money from your father? She said I have no idea but I’m not going to turn it down.”Ms Ho, who is also managing director of the MGM Grand Macau, said last month: “I think [people] are a little bit confused because the Ho family represents many things at the same time.“It becomes a bit cumbersome when I need to explain which side of the family business I’m involved with and …convince people that we are independent …Doing both the MGM venture on a private basis and continuing to manage and develop Shun Tak’s business itself do not carry, at least to date, any contradiction.”
171;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2008-01-15T18:00:30Z;Regulator query delays Macao gaming IPO;;Sociedade de Jogos de Macau has delayed the launch of its long-awaited initial public offering until at least next week, after the gaming company controlled by tycoon Stanley Ho was asked by the Hong Kong market regulator for more information.SJM, which plans to raise $1bn on the Hong Kong stock exchange, had been scheduled to start its roadshow on Tuesday but postponed the launch pending what one person involved said was a minor “procedural delay” to answer queries from the Securities and Futures Commission, the market regulator. SJM had been hoping to debut on February 4.“It’s just got so many moving parts. Don’t expect the roadshow this week,” one person said. “But it’s not a showstopper.”SJM’s listing, which was approved by the Hong Kong stock exchange’s listing committee, must also be cleared by the regulator’s corporate finance department before it can print a draft prospectus for investors. SJM and Deutsche Bank, which is leading the offer with support from CLSA and BNP Paribas, declined to comment, as did the market regulator.The IPO has been in the works for two years and involves a complicated corporate restructuring at SJM and its parent, Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau. Mr Ho is managing director of both companies, and also their public face.STDM’s multiple shareholders include the families of Cheng Yu-teng, who controls the New World group, and Henry Fok, the late Hong Kong tycoon. The company has also been at the centre of a long-running and highly litigious feud between Mr Ho and his estranged sister Winnie over her interest in the company.“We’ve had more lawyers working on this than bankers,” said another person involved in the deal.Macao’s gaming market, which surpassed the Las Vegas strip as the world’s largest in 2006, was monopolised for 40 years by Mr Ho and STDM. It was liberalised in 2002, paving the way for investments from some of the world’s largest casino companies including Las Vegas Sands, MGM Mirage, Wynn Resorts of the US and Australia’s Publishing and Broadcasting (now called Consolidated Media Holdings).SJM would use part of the proceeds to buy the 18 casinos it manages on its parent’s behalf, according to people close to the transaction. While still the dominant player in the sector, the company has lost market share to rivals.BNP Paribas estimates that the company will report a 60 per cent decline in net profit to $128m for 2007, after investing in a new flagship casino that opened in February, the Grand Lisboa.Total gaming revenues for all of Macao reached $7.36bn in the first nine months of last year – compared with $7.19bn in all of 2006.
172;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-12-18T19:08:55Z;Christmas cheer at the gaming tables;;Edmund Ho, Macao’s chief executive, appears to be doing his bit to broker a Christmas truce among the big egos who dominate the global gaming industry.On Tuesday night Kirk Kerkorian, who controls MGM Mirage, followed peers such as Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn into Macao with the opening of his first casino in the Chinese special administrative region, which last year eclipsed the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s largest gaming market. At the insistence of Ho, invitations to the opening of the MGM Grand Macau were extended even to sometimes bitter rivals.“The [Macao] chief executive has strongly recommended all competitors be invited to all openings,” Terry Lanni, MGM Mirage chief executive, told Observer’s man in Macao. “I mean, we invited Sheldon Adelson and he wouldn’t be on my Christmas card list.”Adelson, head of Las Vegas Sands, did not make an appearance. But at least he finally has something from MGM Mirage to put on his mantelpiece.Hard labourFor two decades, the United Auto Workers union has tried – and failed – to persuade workers at Toyota, Honda and other foreign-owned plants in the southern US that union membership is the way to more secure jobs and better working conditions.Despite all that effort, not a single plant has signed up. So it is now trying a warmer and more fuzzy tack. A new television and online advertisement campaign, entitled “I am the UAW”, makes no mention of greedy bosses or the downtrodden proletariat.Instead, it seeks to overcome southerners’ suspicions of organised labour by featuring union members talking about the safety of toys imported from China, foreign sweatshops and community work.“Look at the letters, UAW,” enthuses a worker at a Ford plant in Michigan, who helps cancer patients and coaches cheerleaders in her spare time. “It’s unity, unique …all working …all wonderful. I look at it as a family, not an organisation.”The TV adverts will be shown first in four cities. Detroit, the UAW’s home town, is one. The others are in Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi, all home to Asian car plants.With the auto industry facing tough times next year, the union may get a more sympathetic hearing. But don’t count on it.Too easy?The Christmas gift card has made shopping much easier. But does the convenient card have a downside?According to Deloitte Financial Advisory Services, the pre-paid store cards are becoming a conduit for money laundering, allowing fraudsters to shift dodgy money across the US and the world illegally. While banks have regulatory measures in place to spot shifty transactions, Deloitte says retailers and other businesses that trade in gift cards have no measures in place to find the dreaded “anomaly” transactions.But don’t worry too much. Lawmakers in Washington are on the case. Two bills in the House of Representatives could see gift cards treated more like regular currency under the law. Dirty money will have to find another way to travel.Holiday surplusSpare a thought this Christmas for the fisheries ministers of the 27 European Union states. Every year at this time they convene to haggle over who gets to catch the few remaining cod and sprats in European waters.Quota talks usually drag on until the early hours and this year it is even worse, as they have to wait for their agricultural colleagues to thrash out a fundamental reform aimed at draining the EU wine lake.So Observer is touched to hear that they give each other presents every year. In keeping with the theme, Jonathan Shaw of the UK offered up British sparkling wine and apples.He got plenty in return. “Hilary [Benn, his boss] does not drink or eat meat and there is a lot of booze among the presents so I end up taking his, too,” he said.Partying downNicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is making life hard for British diplomats in Paris.The embassy has decided to cancel next year’s sumptuous summer party to save money. The Queen’s birthday party was a highlight of the diplomatic calendar. Each year thousands of guests stroll the ambassador’s elegant gardens on the rue du Faubourg St Honoré, quaffing Pol Roger and strawberries and cream. But not in 2008.Sir Peter Westmacott, the British ambassador, has decided to spend the money instead on extra temporary staff. France takes over the EU’s six-month rotating presidency in July. With a hyperactive Sarkozy in charge, the embassy will have to work harder to protect vital national interests.It is just the kind of diplomatic effort the ascetic Gordon Brown approves of.Slopes, not pollsWhy vote when you can ski? South Koreans get precious few days off, so with the presidential election falling on a Wednesday and the outcome obvious, many people are taking the opportunity to snatch a long weekend.Mountain resorts around the country report a sharp spike in reservations over the rest of this week, while travel agents have been inundated with requests for five-day packages to south-east Asia. Polls suggest that voter turn-out will plumb a record low on Wednesday.Observer guesses that democracy means voting with your feet.
173;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-10-11T10:07:43Z;Permira takes $838m stake in Galaxy;;Permira placed a bet on the booming Macao casino market on Thursday, agreeing to pay $838m for a 20 per cent stake in one of the territory’s licensed industry operators.In its first deal in Asia, the UK private equity company is taking a minority stake in Galaxy Entertainment, controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Lui Che-woo, in what marks a change from Permira’s modus operandi.“It’s unusual in itself,” Martin Clarke, Permira partner and head of global consumer investments, said of the transaction. “In Europe traditionally we’ve done LBOs [leveraged buy-outs] and been in control – or been part of a consortium that controls.”However, Mr Clarke made it clear that Permira, whose investments include European gaming group Gala Coral, would take an active interest in Galaxy’s development plans and gain two seats on its board.“We are not a passive investor. We will be involved in all major strategic decisions of the company,” he said, adding that Permira and Galaxy had a “shared vision” outlined in a five-year strategy paper. It will also have veto and non-dilution rights and a commitment from the Lui family not to sell its stake.The deal highlights a new trend for big private equity groups to invest more in emerging markets, minority stakes and faster-growing companies that require less debt, to make up for their inability to do “mega buy-outs” of large listed companies as a result of the credit squeeze.Permira’s partner in Macao, which last year eclipsed the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s largest gaming market, is a Hong Kong property magnate who fell out with his last international ally.When Macao’s gaming market was liberalised in 2002, Mr Lui and Sheldon Adelson, chairman of Las Vegas Sands, formed a joint venture casino company. But after it became apparent that the two men had different visions for the joint venture, they agreed to part ways.Mr Lui said he was confident his second overseas marriage would be better than his first. “We had different viewpoints [with Las Vegas Sands],” he said. “But [Permira] has spent a lot of time getting to know us. It was not an overnight decision.”Permira was advised by Deutsche Bank and Galaxy by Merrill Lynch.
174;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-08-27T21:36:56Z;Venetian Macao plays a strong hand;;The opening of Las Vegas Sands’ Venetian Macao resort and casino will force rivals to step up their game or “shrivel up and die”, according to the company’s president and chief operating officer.“A huge gauntlet has been thrown down to the marketplace,” William Weidner told the Financial Times. “You have to build the physical infrastructure to draw the customer.”The Venetian, whose facilities include the world’s largest casino, was built at a cost of $2.4bn and has 3,000 suites – equivalent to 25 per cent of Macao’s stock of hotel rooms – and 1.2m sq ft of convention space. It is believed to be the world’s second largest, non-industrial complex behind the Aalsmeer flower market in Holland.The Venetian’s resort, casino and retail operations will initially employ 16,000 people. When all of Sands’ expansion projects are completed by the end of 2009, the company expects to employ 70,000 people – equivalent to one-quarter of the tiny territory’s workforce.The Venetian’s opening represents the second time in four years that Las Vegas Sands and its chairman, Sheldon Adelson, have turned Macao’s gaming industry upside down. Monopolised by tycoon Stanley Ho for 40 years, the market was liberalised in 2002 and last year eclipsed the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s largest gambling centre.Mr Adelson’s first investment, the Sands Macao, opened in 2004, formally ending Mr Ho’s dominance in the former Portuguese enclave. Intended to cater to day-tripping gamblers from nearby Hong Kong and mainland China, the Sands Macao paid back Mr Adelson’s $265m investment in less than one year.Mr Adelson, famous for launching the Comdex computer trade show, is now gambling that Macao will trace Las Vegas’s evolution into a convention and holiday mecca.“We had to build critical mass,” Mr Weidner said. “The leap here is to move Macao from a day market to a multi-day stay market. You need all the bells and whistles to do that.”Mr Weidner also recalled his first visit to Macao and Mr Ho’s original flagship casino, the Lisboa, as a young industry executive in 1980.“It was just an amazing sight. The Lisboa looked like the cockfight scene in The Deer Hunter,” Mr Weidner said. “We in Las Vegas couldn’t believe a place as poorly executed as the Lisboa did as well as it did.”Mr Ho’s riposte to the Macao Sands – and also Steve Wynn’s Wynn Macau – came in February when he inaugurated the Grand Lisboa. But neither the tycoon nor Mr Wynn, who recently announced the delay of a planned expansion at his Macao casino, have revealed plans for a resort facility on the scale of the Venetian.
175;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-08-27T12:04:07Z;Macao gaming;;Tuesday sees the opening of the world’s largest casino on one of its tiniest spits of land. Las Vegas Sands’ $2.5bn Venetian Macao is big enough to hold 90 jumbo jets or – shimmying through streetscapes “reminiscent of Venice” – many, many customers. Can Lady Luck keep smiling on the tiny Chinese enclave and its (largely US) casino operators?Macanese gaming has grown rapidly since deregulation in 2004. Macao, China’s only legal gambling den, last year overtook Las Vegas as the biggest gaming spot. The Venetian takes that to new levels, increasing the number of gaming tables by 20 per cent and machines by 33 per cent, according to PwC. Nonetheless, few would make a wager on the Venetian flopping. Sheldon Adelson, chief of Las Vegas Sands, recouped the $265m investment on his first Macao casino within a year of opening.The bill is bigger this time: Moody’s expects development costs of $4bn through to the end of 2008. But visitors continue to flood Macao. Nearly 13m visited in the first half, up 21 per cent from last year. And Macanese table yields are about treble those of Las Vegas, a margin that leaves plenty of room for some competitive erosion.That said, the Venetian – along with other upcoming mega-casinos from the likes of MGM Mirage and Steve Wynn – is still taking a gamble. The resort complex transforms a gaming den into a destination for shoppers and convention delegates: the Las Vegas model but without the Las Vegas infrastructure. Generating the bulk of revenues from non-gaming activities is harder when transport is lamentable and the labour force just 275,000 strong. Reliance on imported labour has already caused friction, resulting in the sort of protests likely to make delegates think twice about heading over for a conference.
176;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-08-07T17:34:27Z;The Short View: Extreme volatility;;What in the markets can we rely upon? It was hard, ahead of Tuesday’s announcement from the Federal Reserve’s federal open market committee, to discern patterns in the extreme volatility of the past weeks. But one or two trends were clear.First, markets have lost faith in small-cap stocks. That is a logical response to more expensive credit. Small stocks are more likely to be bought out by private equity – justifying a premium while debt was cheap – and have debt on their balance sheet.The Russell 2000 index of smaller US stocks has endured a true “correction”, down more than 10 per cent from its recent high, even after Monday’s rally.Another long-term pattern that seems to be over is the dominance of “value” investing (buying stocks that are cheap compared to the underlying value of their assets) against “growth” investing (picking stocks with fast-growing earnings). It had grown difficult for bargain-hunters to find true “value” after a lengthy bull market, and investors are now attracted by the relative safety of stocks with strong earnings.What has endured the mess of the past few weeks? First, faith in emerging markets remains almost undimmed. Normally in risk aversion, emerging markets would be expected to fall further than the market as a whole. They have budged but barely any more than the rest of the market. By Monday’s close, MSCI’s emerging markets index had fallen 7.5 per cent since July 19, when the MSCI world index peaked. The world index itself was down 6.1 per cent. For the year, emerging markets were up 16.5 per cent, against 4.8 per cent for the world index. Compared with other risky assets, faith in emerging markets remains robust.Faith in human frailty also remains constant. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts have both gained more than 40 per cent in less than a month.For FOMC reaction, visit www.ft.com/shortview
177;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-07-12T18:37:40Z;Observer: The shopping bag is the message;;A charity sale of British designer Anya Hindmarch’s canvas tote bag – wittily adorned with the phrase “I’m not a plastic bag” – was meant to raise awareness about the excessive use of plastic bags.The limited edition bags, designed for activist organisation We Are What We Do, became must-have fashion statements after celebrities including Keira Knightley and Alicia Silverstone were photographed with them.Crowds mobbed shops in Taiwan and Hong Kong last week when the bags, which are ostensibly environmentally friendly, went on sale. So many people showed up in Hong Kong that the sale had to be delayed and those at the front of the queue were given tokens to pick up their bags at a later date.When the lucky shoppers in Hong Kong went to pick up their bags on Tuesday, they were given their tote bag wrapped in three plastic bags so it would be disguised. It was apparently an ill-advised attempt by the store to avoid a repeat of the earlier, frenzied scene.We are what we do, indeed. But then again, in terms of making a public point about how people misuse plastic bags, it was a stroke of genius.Roll againLas Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts may have changed the way casino gambling is played in Macao, but the two US operators have not managed to change the games.It was the local Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, however, which this week introduced the traditional American casino favourite, craps. At SJM’s flagship Grand Lisboa casino, craps now competes for attention with Chinese dice games sic-bo and fish-prawn-crab and Macao’s perennial top draw, baccarat.SJM’s parent company tried to bring craps tables to Macao about 30 years ago, but the dice sat still. Tim Gilbert, vice president of table gaming, thinks this time may be different.“They’ll be drawn across the floor to this game,” he says, referring to the heavily Chinese clientele. “They are naturally drawn to crowded, boisterous entertainment.’’The Grand Lisboa is hedging its bet. So far it is opening one craps table and offering free lessons with dummy chips each weekday.Eight is the most auspicious number for Chinese, as against craps’ focus on the western lucky seven. So the casino might have boosted its odds by changing the game slightly – but no dice.Gore’s campaignAl Gore claims the Live Earth concerts he helped to organise last weekend were the biggest media event in history, based on global television and internet audiences.But in many countries, viewing figures were poor.In the US, for example, Live Earth suffered the ultimate humiliation of being beaten in the ratings by a soccer match.Only 2.75m people tuned in for the climate change awareness concerts compared with the 2.9m who watched Argentina trounce Peru 4-0 in the Copa America.The ratings were a disappointment for those in the Democratic party who hoped Live Earth would act as a springboard for Gore to enter the 2008 US presidential race.But there could be one final catalyst for the former vice-president to revive his White House ambitions before primary elections start in January.Gore has been nominated for this year’s Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his efforts to save the planet from global warming.The winner is scheduled to be announced in October and Gore supporters believe the award would provide the perfect piece of free publicity with which to launch a presidential campaign.Gore has repeatedly said that he has no intention of running for the Democratic nomination. But polls show he could be a threat to Hillary Clinton if he did.Perhaps Mrs Clinton should start lobbying for Bono – the rock star activist and perennial Nobel prize hopeful – just to make sure.Dim prospectFloodlight failure is nothing new at football matches in south-east Asia. International gambling syndicates have been known to pay a small fortune to ensure that games do not end in a result that would cost them a large fortune.So when half the lights went out on Wednesday in the Asian Cup group match in Jakarta between Saudi Arabia and South Korea six minutes before the final whistle with the score at 1-1, it seemed very suspicious.Interpol did not have to be alerted, however. The cause of the blackout was a problem at the state electricity company’s local base station.Luckily for all concerned, staff at the 45-year-old Gelora Bung Karno stadium (which has undergone an $8m facelift for the tournament) were able to dust down the generator. They got it started in just under 30 minutes, after which the match would have been abandoned.The embarrassing fiasco is not surprising. Indonesia’s creaking infrastructure needs $140bn to be spent on it in the next decade to maintain current growth levels.“Brownouts”, where the electricity dips, are common across much of the country, the water system is crumbling and there has been a litany of fatal transport crashes this year.Now that the world has witnessed the problems, it remains to be seen whether foreigners will have been encouraged to invest.And as for the floodlights, tournament organisers say the generator will now be working overtime to ensure they stay on for as long as necessary.Spoilers uniteEconomists have developed many econometric models aimed at estimating how valuable certain actions are to people. They could soon have an interesting case study to put some of their theories to the test.Certain members of the Bancroft family, the clan that controls Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal, have put pressure on the board to meet investors interested in coming up with a rival bid to the $5bn on the table from Rupert Murdoch.The meetings, some of which took place this week, seem to be mainly with billionaires or multi-millionaires who have an axe to grind against Murdoch.Ron Burkle, the Californian supermarket billionaire, took a drubbing in Murdoch’s New York Post’s Page Six gossip pages. Brad Greenspan, the internet entrepreneur who had a stake in the company that owned MySpace (and made millions when Murdoch bought it for $580m) has been trying to get more money from the sale, though his legal challenges failed. There was even talk of Charlie Ergen, who owns US satellite group Echostar, getting involved. Ergen bought rival DirecTV several years ago only to have the deal blocked by regulators after a mighty lobbying effort led by Murdoch. It looks as though the talks are not really amounting to anything serious – so far Murdoch remains the only bidder.The others seem unlikely to cough up the cash to thwart him, but if they are able to give the board enough ammo to press for a higher price from News Corp, they will be rubbing their hands with glee and notching up lots of utility value.Bankers banquetAnyone left with doubts about why The Rolling Stones still endure marathon tours when they could be kicking back in luxury can rest assured – it’s all about the money. Despite a busy schedule on their current “A Bigger Bang” world tour, The Stones last night gave a private show to a select group of bankers and financial analysts at the ultra-trendy Hotel Arts in Barcelona.The band was reportedly paid about €4m to strut its stuff in the middle of a two-day financial products conference hosted by Deutsche Bank. Observer expects news soon of a Stones bond issue securitised on future royalties and tours.Send your comments to observer@ft.com
178;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-06-27T19:23:00Z;Playboy mansion planned for Macao resort;;Playboy Enterprises on Wednesday said it would open a 40,000 sq ft “entertainment destination” in Macao in 2009. It will feature not just bars, restaurants and shops but also a “Hugh M. Hefner Villa” modelled on the famous mansion built by the company’s founder.The complex will be part of Macao Studio City, a $2bn integrated resort and casino being built by Hong Kong-listed eSun Holdings and a US investment consortium.A casino will be run by Melco PBL, one of Macao’s six licensed gaming companies. Macao Studio City will also include television and film production facilities, a theatre, an arena and three hotels, among them a Marriott and a Ritz Carlton.Playboy is the latest globally recognised brand – including Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts – to have come to the region. Macao’s gaming industry last year eclipsed the Las Vegas strip as the world’s largest with revenues of $6.9bn.Although classy new casinos have transformed Macao, brothels, thinly disguised as sauna parlours and karaoke lounges, remain an integral part of the city’s underbelly and continue to draw many visitors.Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts entered the territory with casinos in 2004 and 2006 respectively.The debut of the $2.3bn Venetian Macao, a Sands development, will be the first test of Macao’s ambition to become a premier convention, tourist and entertainment destination.The 3,000-room resort’s facilities and attractions will include a 15,000-seat arena and another theatre for a resident Cirque du Soleil troupe.Sands is also sponsoring exhibition tennis matches featuring Roger Federer and Pete Sampras, and the Manchester United football team. Macao could not have dreamt of hosting such acts when it was a sleepy backwater.Not everyone is convinced that Macao will be able to match Las Vegas as an entertainment capital. “It does take time for [non-gaming] assets to ramp up,” one casino executive in the territory said.“None of us knows what the entertainment piece will be.”
179;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;On Asia: Place your bets as investors punt on Macao boom;;"There is a place in greater China where the economy is growing even faster than the soaraway mainland, where gross domestic product is rising at 15 per cent a year, and where average wages are climbing at a similar rate.Welcome to Macao, the special territory handed back by Portugal to China in 1999, which is experiencing a casino-led, once-in-a-lifetime boom.The ratio of cranes to surface area whirring away on the Cotai strip – land recently reclaimed between two of Macao’s three islands – is high enough to give Dubai a run for its money.For international investors looking to put money into Asia, a Macao punt must be tempting.However, a debate rages over whether the growth story forms part of a genuine, sustainable re-rating of the economy or an investment-led boom that is likely to blow up when the speculators move on to the next opportunity.Of course, the simplest way to make money out of Macao is to jump on the one-hour ferry from Hong Kong and head for one of the territory’s casinos.Local casino king Stanley Ho lost his monopoly five years ago, after which US groups such as Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands landed to spruce up the Macao gaming experience.However, fund managers can play Macao via that other risky casino – the stock market.It is worth remembering that gaming revenues in Macao last year climbed 22 per cent to $6.95bn, surpassing the Las Vegas strip as the world’s biggest gaming hub in revenue for the first time.The forecast further rise in gaming revenues, as China allows millions more of its citizens every year to travel to Macao, has helped turn the spotlight on listed gaming operators.Several are listed in the US, including Wynn and Sands, whose share prices have been boosted by their Macao adventures.There is Melco PBL, the joint venture between Macao’s Melco and Australia’s PBL, which listed on Nasdaq last December and is a pure play on the territory.Melco PBL’s first casino, Crown Macao, opened last month over budget and with most of its higher-margin VIP tables unfinished. Investors will be hoping the opening of the partnership’s City of Dreams underwater casino on the Cotai strip next year runs smoother.Then there is Hong Kong-listed Galaxy Entertainment, which runs five casinos and is quietly fancied by many analysts.Galaxy focuses on attracting the nouveaux riches of the mainland, who make up 80 per cent of the gamblers who visit Macao. The company’s market share is a creditable 21 per cent, while its share of the crucial VIP market is nearer 30 per cent.At only eight times 2009 earnings, Billy Ng at JPMorgan rates Galaxy as the cheapest of the Macao gaming plays, given that its peers trade at between 11 times and 16 times forward earnings. He believes the share price could rise 25 per cent to HK$10 by the end of the year from HK$8.06 yesterday.The other sector to target is property. Choice abounds here too.Among them are Hong Kong-listed Shun Tak, which is developing many of Macao’s high-end residences, and the Macau Property Opportunities Fund, whose share price has risen 30 per cent since listing on London’s Alternative Investment Market a year ago.However, analysts are divided on whether property companies will continue to benefit from the boom.For instance, the brains at Goldman Sachs are bullish on Polytec Asset Holdings, believing the Hong Kong-listed developer is well positioned to benefit from the territory’s strong fundamentals. Goldman’s Anthony Wu says: “Macao is becoming less dependent on gaming, and this will help support the economy and the housing sector over the long term.”Not so, according to George Choi at Citigroup, who this week slapped a sell recommendation on the stock. He says: “We believe that the property market is driven by speculators; also, that developers will face higher land acquisition and labour construction costs, which will depress future margins.”Citigroup notes that a record 17,000 residential units are committed to be built over the next four years, fuelling rampant wage inflation among the hard-hat brigade. The government is also set to change policy and dispose of its land through auctions, not back-room deals, a move likely to drive up acquisition costs.Then again, owner occupation in Macao is close to 80 per cent, and locals typically spend only a quarter of household income on mortgage repayments. With wages rising fast, there is room for the Macanese to upgrade to newer apartments.The bulls say only 20 per cent of the $35bn committed to investment in the territory has been spent, ensuring the growth story will continue for a while. Even Sir Richard Branson, the UK entrepreneur, is trying to jump on the bandwagon and acquire land and a licence to build a $3bn casino.sunny.tucker@ft.com"
180;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-05-22T20:36:41Z;S&P 500 gives up earlier gains;;Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday, with technology the bright spot, as blue chips and the S&P 500 index failed to sustain record breaking momentum.Without fresh economic data, investors focused on deals news, with shares in MGM Mirage surging 27.1 per cent to $79.98. Kirk Kerkorian said Tracinda, his investment company, was negotiating with MGM about buying the casino operator’s Bellagio Hotel and City-Center properties in Las Vegas. Mr Kerkorian holds a 56 per cent stake in MGM.The S&P 500 made another foray above its record close of 1,527.46 set on March 24, 2000 on Tuesday, but could not hold gains. The S&P reached an intra-day high of 1,529.24, a shade under Monday’s intraday high of 1,529.87.The US benchmark again struggled to make the decisive move higher that would eclipse the all-time intraday high of 1,552.87 – set on the same day as the all-time closing high seven years ago. Late in New York, the S&P had closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,522.11. Technology and financials were the only two positive sectors among the 10 major industry groups in the index. Materials and energy stocks led losses.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.4 per cent higher at 2,588.02, and had reversed weakness earlier in the day as semiconductor stocks rebounded.Blue chips set an new intra-day record high, but failed to hold that rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.02 per cent lower to close at 13,539.95 after it had set a new record high of 13,586.68.The S&P’s flirtation with record levels comes after more than 90 per cent of companies in the index have reported first-quarter results.“Although US growth has been slowing, S&P 500 margins seem to have been maintained in part thanks to the strength of the global economy and a weakening dollar which have boosted overseas sales. Around 30 per cent of revenues now come from abroad,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.“While earnings growth may continue to decelerate, we are not likely to see outright falls as long as the US does not go into recession and growth elsewhere stays robust.”Although recent economic data have been inconsistent, the stock market is riding a wave of liquidity, say analysts. “There is an ample supply of inexpensive investment capital and real interest rates remain low,” said Doug Peta, equity strategist at J&W Seligman.As stock prices have rallied since the end of March, short sales of shares have risen sharply – indicating that some investors expect the market to suffer a reversal.A short sale is a sale of a security that the seller does not own, and makes money if prices fall.Late on Monday, the New York Stock Exchange said the number of shares that have been sold short, known as short interest, increased to 11.8bn as of May 10, a new record high, from 11.0bn on April 13.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said the 7 per cent rise in short interest over the past month was the 10th largest monthly increase in short interest over the last 16 years. They concluded: “It is hard to imagine that investors are overly bullish with short interest hitting record highs month after month.”Amid the MGM casino news, other gaming stocks rose on Tuesday, led by Boyd Gaming, up 5.5 per cent to $49.64, Wynn Resorts, up 7.4 per cent to $101.15 and Las Vegas Sands higher by 5.6 per cent at $80.19.On the back of Fremont General’s sale of its commercial real estate business to iStar, other mortgage lenders rallied, with shares in Accredited Home Lenders rising 4.9 per cent to $13.38. Shares in iStar rallied 3.9 per cent to $47.60.In company news, Chevron said it planned to sell its 12 per cent stake in power producer Dynegy, the power producer, in a move to exit non-core operations. Shares in Dynegy fell 3.3 per cent to $9.83, while Chevron was 0.8 per cent lower at $82.18.In earnings news, Staples said its first-quarter profit rose 12 per cent, but lowered its guidance for future earnings. Shares in the office products supplier had slid 2.4 per cent to close at $25.05.A brokerage upgrade boosted Citrix Systems, by 5.4 per cent to $32.91. The software maker set a recent high of $34.63 in late April.
181;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-03-28T20:36:23Z;Casino defeat adds to disillusionment in gaming;;Wednesday night’s parliamentary defeat over plans for 17 new casinos is just the latest in a series of highs and lows that must have left the gambling industry identifying with the emotional roller coaster ridden by many of its consumers.First, there was euphoria when ministers kick-started liberalisation of the industry, followed by angst when casino expansion plans were watered down, and despair when Gordon Brown, the chancellor, last week upped the tax rate on big casinos to 50 per cent.Small wonder that Wednesday night’s rejection of the Manchester super-casino and 16 other large and small casinos was greeted with open hostility.Blackpool supporters know that this is a pyrrhic victory, however. If there is any real winner here it is the Conservatives, who supported the choice of locations put forward by the Casino ­Advisory Panel but voted tactically against the ­recommendations.Marc Etches, one of the earliest proponents of a Las Vegas-style casino in Blackpool, said the government’s gambling policy had lacked clarity from the beginning.“The political mess it finds itself in is entirely of its own making,” he said. The policy had already caused the near-wholesale retreat of US ­operators, such as MGM and Las Vegas Sands, frustrated by wasted years lobbying for what was originally meant to be several super-casinos.Neil Goulden, chief executive of Gala Coral, said: “The whole industry is just very disillusioned with the way the Department of Culture, Media and Sport has handled the whole thing.”The Gambling Act had started out with a good balance of social responsibility and legitimate commercial interest, he said. “But the government meddled and created more problems than they solved.”From the wreckage of her policy, Ms Jowell could come up with a new set of locations. The government could even perform a dramatic U-turn by deciding that Blackpool should, after all, be the super-casino location.But if Manchester, and any locations originally recommended by the Casino Advisory Panel, were to be discarded, they would be hot-footing it to the courts to seek a judicial remedy.Rank, the bingo and casino group that last week issued a profits warning on the back of the chancellor’s Budget tax rise, felt sympathy for the local authorities affected.“They have made significant investments in time and money to reach this stage in the expectation of future regeneration benefits and we can only imagine their frustration and disappointment,” Rank said.In spite of Rank’s supportive response, however, the industry has failed to maintain a united front in favour of the expansion.The prospect of new casinos had prompted ambivalence among operators already fretting about oversupply. That was why the British Casino Association had wanted a judicial review of the panel’s decision.Casino operators now find themselves back where they started.The government does have more time. But at the fag end of Tony Blair’s premiership, it may be hard to recapture the impetus for a fresh attempt at casino-inspired regeneration.
182;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-02-05T23:57:10Z;Macao casinos shuffle their dealers’ hands;;It was too good an opportunity for Stanley Ho to ignore.When the Macao gaming tycoon’s arch-rival, Sheldon Adelson, chairman of the Las Vegas Sands empire, sacked 160 dealers at the Sands Macao in November for not being up to snuff, Mr Ho was quick to take advantage.He invited the former Sands dealers to apply for jobs, declaring: “It is our duty of care to the Macao community to employ quality, talented local Macao residents and to nurture them for a long and successful career with our company.” His group, Sociedade de Jogos de Macao, has since hired 110 of them, the company said on Monday.Mr Ho’s eagerness to hire Mr Adelson’s former dealers highlighted a problem that gambling companies now flocking to Macao face: dealer jobs are reserved for local residents. Macao pipped the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s largest gaming market by revenues late last year, but while the territory’s gaming revenues have trebled in the past six years, over the same period its population has increased by only 16 per cent to 510,000.This is not far off Las Vegas’ population of 590,000. But casinos in Las Vegas, America’s fastest growing major city, can recruit dealers from surrounding Clark County (population 1.9m) or seek talent from across the US.“If all the projects [under construction] open, are there enough Macanese to man the tables? No, there are not,” says one industry ­executive. “We need to discuss how we are going to staff this thing with the ­government.”Management and support jobs at casinos and most positions at ancillary hotel and restaurant facilities can be held by non-residents if they are issued “blue cards” by the government.But industry executives complain that securing a blue card can take six months or longer.“It’s the number one strategic issue for us – it’s very difficult to get them,” says one senior casino executive.The labour shortages may have social ramifications for Macao, critics say. Across Macao, tales are told of university students for­saking tuition deposits and doctors’ receptionists abandoning their posts to take up casino jobs.“Economically it represents development, but the consequences are unfortunate,” says Father Luis Xavier, whose 1885 church now sits in the shadow of Mr Adelson’s $2.3bn (£1.2bn, €1.8bn) Venetian Macao.When it opens this summer, the Venetian Macao will have more than 700 tables, 3,000 rooms, a 1.2m sq ft convention centre, and 850,000 sq ft of retail space.People who share Father Xavier’s concerns about his new neighbour, which is just one of many big “integrated resorts” in the pipeline, worry that Macao risks becoming “a society of croupiers”. Casino executives say that they are simply doing their best to service explosive growth in a tightly regulated labour market.Galaxy Entertainment – controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Lui Che-woo – ran around-the-clock training sessions for dealer trainees, the bulk of whom are in their late teens or early twenties, before the opening of two big casinos last year.Mr Ho’s Sociedade de Jogos de Macao, which has been on the defensive ever since it lost its gaming monopoly in 2002, is under the most pressure. It has been losing dealers and market share to Mr Adelson, Mr Lui and Steve Wynn, who opened his Wynn Macau casino in ­September.The sackings at the Sands not only gave Mr Ho a golden public relations opportunity, they also came just three months before he was due to inaugurate his first big new casino since the market’s 2002 liberalisation. The Grand Lisboa opens its doors this Sunday.“It was seen as a free kick for SJM at the time because they had taken the lion’s share of dealer losses [to poaching],” says one Macao-based industry executive. “It was a free gift back for SJM.”
183;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-01-23T23:42:46Z;Macao gambling;;It’s official: Macao, the tiny Chinese enclave, has overtaken the Las Vegas Strip to become the world’s biggest gambling den. Macao last year raked in revenues of $6.95bn, slightly ahead of estimates for the Strip.Few expect the dollars to stop flowing in Macao – and certainly not US operators such as Las Vegas Sands and industry veteran Steve Wynn. They are making multibillion-dollar bets on the former Portuguese colony, in part to offset their more mature home market. Lady Luck would seem to be on their side. As China’s sole legalised gambling joint, Macao hosts millions of mainland visitors each year: 12m last year as well as 7m from the more affluent Hong Kong. Those numbers, up 15 per cent and 24 per cent respectively on a year-on-year basis, should continue to swell as China grows richer and more liberal with tourist visas. Macao is also more profitable and, so far, operators have recouped their initial investments far more quickly than in other jurisdictions.True, yields are dropping as Macao embraces the mass market – but yields on tables, according to PwC, are still treble the size of those in Las Vegas. Macao’s biggest bugbears are poor infrastructure – meaning gamblers can get snarled up in traffic jams – and limited human resources. Importing labour is politically delicate in an enclave of half a million people and has already sparked protests.For now, robust demand overrides these snags. But profitability may suffer as the number of gaming tables virtually doubles by 2010 and regional neighbours such as Singapore start encroaching on Macao’s turf. Of course, the government has an incentive to tackle transport and labour issues: the bulk of its revenue is from gaming. Even so, investors look as starry-eyed as punters when it comes to Macanese gamers: Hong Kong-based Melco trades at 63 times this year’s forecast earnings.
184;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2007-01-03T23:27:30Z;Singapore;;The wages of sin is growth. The decision by Singapore’s government to abolish bans on gaming and bar-top dancing seems to be paying off. Fuelled by tourists and shopping and in spite of a slowdown in electronics exports, growth in the island state exceeded expectations, reaching 5.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter. In 2006 as a whole, the economy is estimated to have grown 7.7 per cent, a rate probably only surpassed in Asia by India and China.Such an achievement is owing, in part, to efforts to reduce the economy’s dependence on electronics and biotechnology exports. Large budget surpluses mean the state can assist as well as direct these efforts, for example by releasing land for development. The need for diversification is pressing. Goods and services exports are equivalent to about 2.5 times gross domestic product – and half go to the US, where demand is slowing. In addition, like its neighbours, Singapore is grappling with unwanted currency appreciation and with the resultant loss of competitiveness against China.The diversification path chosen looks a profitable one. After the government awarded licences last year, Las Vegas Sands and Genting are spending an estimated US$6.5bn building two mega-casinos. Tourist arrivals – a record 9.5m in 2006 – are targeted to increase to 17m by 2015. By then, DBS Vickers estimates, the resorts will each be adding US$1.8bn, or 0.8 per cent, to GDP. The projects are spurring both job creation and a boom in construction and property. These in turn are underpinning consumer demand and the surging equity market, up 27 per cent in 2006.Singapore may end up shedding its traditional straight-laced image as a result of these changes. But on many fronts, not least in order to maintain strong economic growth – another Singaporean tradition – such a sacrifice may be more than welcome.
185;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-12-18T17:23:33Z;Vice beats virtue in the battle for high returns;;"Bugs Bunny would occasionally have an angel sitting on one shoulder and a devil on the other. Each one would be pulling on his ear, telling him what to do in critical situations. Vice versus virtue. Virtue versus vice. Those two opposing poles distract us at every major decision point during out lives.This year Vice is the winner. The Vice Fund, run by Charles Norton, is up 20 per cent so far this year, while the Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund is up 14 per cent. While keeping pace with the market - no small feat - Vice has clearly pulled ahead thanks to stalwart companies like Las Vegas Sands (up 131 per cent) and cigarette company Reynolds (up 40 per cent). I had a chance to sit down with Norton and dig a little further on how Charles, a self-described family man, finds value in vice.Define “vice”?The Vice Fund (VICEX) is really an alternative sector strategy that focuses on the alcohol, tobacco, gaming and defense industries, and we do so because we believe they offer true investment merit. By the way, many of the most widely held and well-known mutual fund families own shares in companies engaged in the alcohol, tobacco, gaming or defense businesses – Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest holders of Anheuser-Busch. We just happen to focus exclusively on these four sectors.Why is that an investment theme?The ideology is simple: people around the globe have been drinking, smoking, gambling for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Wars have been around since the earliest, hunter-gatherer societies. Few industry groups have a history that dates back that far. And no matter what is happening in the world economy, people will continue to drink, smoke, gamble and nations will need to defend themselves. As a result, in general these companies tend to be steady performers in good times and bad – they are mostly insulated from economic slowdowns.Besides the unvarying demand for their goods and services, there are other investment merits in the companies within these sectors. These businesses have high barriers to entry, and, in general, these companies are highly profitable with deep management teams. With regard to tobacco and alcohol specifically, the products are never made obsolete by a newer technology. And these businesses are global in nature; we have roughly 23 per cent of our portfolio invested in foreign companies that trade in the U.S. via ADR, and many of the domestic firms we have a stake in operate internationally.Do you think the Vice Fund presents a more attractive opportunity than funds like Ave MariaVirtues Fund?We do not perceive them as our competitors. It’s a gray area. I should point out that many of the companies we own in the Vice Fund are stand-up corporate citizens.What are some of your current holdings and why are they cheap?Our top holding right now is Altria Group. The stock is trading at a significant, 20-plus percent discount to the global consumer staples industry despite in-line earnings growth prospects. I believe there are three issues that have depressed MO’s valuation: litigation risk; its current corporate structure; and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the break-up of the food and tobacco businesses. All of those issues are now largely removed, but the valuation still doesn’t reflect that. On the litigation front, the industry has enjoyed a huge streak of defense verdicts. Today, the U.S. tobacco industry has a legal risk profile comparable to other large-scale industries. The timing of Altria spinning off Kraft is now certain – it will be announced on January 31 and will likely be effective in the first quarter. As the restructuring approaches, I believe the stock move towards its sum-of-parts valuation, which is conservatively $100, or around 20 per cent higher than current levels.Las Vegas Sands has been a core holding of ours for well over a year, and it’s been a huge winner for our shareholders. The stock isn’t cheap, but the growth potential here is off the charts. In 2004, Las Vegas Sands opened the first casino in Macao after the long-time monopoly was liberalized in 2001. Macao is just exploding – this year, only two short years after the first non-monopoly casino opened, total Macao gaming revenue is going to surpass the Vegas Strip. The company recently expanded the Sands Macao and is developing the Cotai Strip. As a result, Las Vegas Sands will benefit tremendously as Macao goes from largely a VIP market to a mass market, and convention business booms. Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore ended a 40-year casino ban last year and Las Vegas Sands will open the first casino there 2009. And Japan and Thailand are also studying whether to allow casino gaming; Las Vegas Sands has already been in talks with Japanese officials. Today, roughly 60 per cent of Las Vegas Sands’ revenue and EBITDAR comes from Macao. All told, in the coming years, around 90 per cent of revenue and EBITDAR will come from Asia.On the alcoholic beverages side, our largest holding is Diageo, the leading premium spirits business in the world by volume, by net sales and by operating profit; it also manages 9 of the world’s top 20 spirits brands. North America is experiencing the fastest growth in spirits volume in the world, as consumers are choosing spirits (and wine) over beer. The market leader in the fast-growing U.S. spirits market is Diageo, with about a quarter of the market. The company is a key supplier of liquor to Wal-Mart, which is aiming to aggressively boost its liquor sales, and it’s buying back stock hand over fist.What’s your outlook for the US economy over the next year and how do you think the Vice Fund will behave in various economic climates?The alcohol, tobacco, gaming, and defense sectors, in aggregate, are defensive in nature and tend to outperform the broad market in periods characterized by relatively low returns and periods with relative stagnancy, or worse, in the U.S. economy. Ironically, the Vice Fund was launched in August 2002 and has only operated in an economic expansion. It would logically seem that a defensive fund like the Vice Fund would lag the market in that environment, but in fact the Vice Fund has outperformed the S&P 500 – and is in the top decile of all multi-cap core funds – over every time period, according to Lipper.But the fact is, when the economy contracts these sectors truly shine. And that is the precise environment we seem to be entering.The economy is slowing rather dramatically, led by a sharp contraction in the housing market, and the yield curve’s steep inversion suggests a recession cannot be entirely ruled out. The Fed Chairman himself has said that the time lag from when a policy action is taken and when it’s fully felt could be as long as 18 months; there have been 9 interest rate hikes in the past 18 months that might not have made their way through the system, so further slowing is a real possibility. And, of course, geopolitical tensions are high: conflicts in the Middle East, North Korea’s missile tests, and Iran’s nuclear arms intentions.We think that with time and the changing economic environment, the Vice Fund will perform strongly in all seasons.Do you use all the products you invest in?I’m a family man. My wife and I live in the Dallas suburbs with our three-year-old and infant daughters. I don’t smoke, rarely gamble, and drink only on occasion.

186;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-12-12T00:04:22Z;Casino bid win has tonic effect on Genting;;Shares in Genting and two of its affiliates rose sharply on the first day of trading since the Malaysian gaming and leisure group won the bid to develop the $3.4bn casino complex on Singapore’s resort island of Sentosa.Three Genting group companies listed in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong will raise about $1.4bn selling new shares in the next few weeks to fund the project, scheduled for 2010.Lim Kok Thay, Genting group chairman, said the company would fund the rest of the deal by bank loans, project financing and bonds.Shares in Singapore-listed Genting International, which will take a 75 per cent stake in the project, closed up 24 per cent at 52 Singapore cents on Monday. Star Cruises, which will take a 25 per cent stake in the Sentosa casino resort, saw its stock surge nearly 17 per cent in Hong Kong and 24 per cent in Singapore. Malaysian-listed Genting closed up 9.4 per cent at 32 ringgit.“The stocks just went ballistic today even though there is a flood of new paper coming in,” one Singapore analyst said.Genting International and Star Cruises are expected to use current buoyant stock market sentiment in Asia to raise nearly S$2bn during the next few weeks by separate rights issues.Malaysia’s Genting said on Monday it would place 30m new shares, or 4.25 per cent of its issued paid-up capital, in an exercise to raise about 915m ringgit.Genting International will raise S$350m in a zero-coupon convertible bond issue.Genting lost out to Las Vegas Sands in May for Singapore’s first casino project. But it had long been favoured over two competitors, Kerzner International and Eighth Wonder, for the Sentosa “integrated resort”.
187;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-12-08T11:51:15Z;Genting wins bid for Singapore casino resort;;Genting was selected on Friday to operate Singapore’s second casino resort, which could transform the Malaysian gaming and energy group into one of the leading players in Asia’s fast growing gambling market.The $3.2bn project on Singapore resort island of Sentosa, combined with its casino monopoly in Malaysia, secures Genting’s dominance in the south-east Asian gaming market and makes the region a strong competitor to Macao, Asia’s main gambling centre.“Genting’s selection by Singapore increases its credibility in gaining other licences in Asia as more countries consider legalising gambling,” said Winston Liew, with OCBC Investment Research in Singapore. “Its growing size and international expansion could make it the only serious Asian competitor to US gaming groups coming to the region.”The award of the Singapore licence comes after Genting recently acquired Stanley Leisure, the UK’s biggest casino operator, in a $1.2bn deal that improves its chances of gaining more casino licences as the UK deregulates the gaming industry.Genting, which lost to Las Vegas Sands in May for Singapore’s first casino project, had been favoured over two competitors, Kerzner International and Eighth Wonder, for the Sentosa “integrated resort.” Las Vegas Sands also operates several casinos in Macao.Singapore said Genting offered “the most compelling proposal,” including a Universal Studios theme park that is likely to attract repeat visitors and boost the city-state’s tourism.The project also includes the world’s largest marine park, a museum and six hotels.Genting estimates the Sentosa resort could generate $1.2bn in annual sales for the group. But the project’s cost and the Stanley Leisure takeover is expected to increase debt significantly for its overseas unit, Genting International. Star Cruises, a Genting affiliate that is Asia’s biggest cruise-ship operator, will help finance the Sentosa project.The finances of the parent Genting group are strong due to its Malaysian casino monopoly.Genting’s other businesses, including palm oil plantation, property and oil and gas production, are also expanding, including a recent oil find in Indonesia, and account for a third of total revenue of $1.4bn last year. The group reported profits of $330m.Analysts predict that Singapore’s two casinos could be highly profitable, because they will attract high-rollers. “Singapore offers a more sophisticated environment than Macao,” said a Singapore-based gaming analyst.Singapore estimates that the Sentosa resort could attract 10m visitors annually by 2015, contributing $10bn to the economy and creating 45,000 jobs.
188;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-12-04T20:03:23Z;US deals new blow to UK web betting;;UK online gaming companies hit by the US ban on internet gambling faced a fresh blow on Monday as one of the biggest American casino companies took advantage of their plight with plans to launch its first online gaming site next year.Las Vegas Sands, the world’s largest casino company by value, is teaming up with Cantor Gaming, a Cantor Fitzgerald subsidiary, to build an online platform offering company brands such as The Venetian, Sands, Palazzo, and Paiza. The move comes three months after the US passed a law making it illegal for credit card and other financial payment processing companies to accept online wagers.Bill Weidner, president and chief operating officer of LVS, said in a statement that given the changing online gaming landscape, its move would “put us in a strong position to evaluate and react to other potential opportunities”.LVS officials said the move into online gaming would allow the company to take advantage of the changing environment in the regulation of online gaming worldwide and also of the consolidation of the sector, which is now seen as inevitable.LVS said it would initially use its site to serve the UK market where the where online gambling is legal but due to become subject to regulation next next year.But insiders at LVS said it could see a point when the US eventually regulated online gaming, leaving LVS well placed to build US online customers.MGM Mirage, rivals to LVS, wants the new Democrat-led Congress to conduct a review of the effects of online gaming. Terry Lanni, chief executive of MGM Mirage, last month called on Congress to reverse the ban and to regulate online gaming.The US ban brought leading listed companies in the industry to their knees almost overnight, after they concluded their executives faced arrest on US soil if they continued to take bets from US customers.The ban saw European companies including PartyGaming, Sportingbet, Bwin and 888 Holdings lose billions in their valuations as a result of the ban, effectively cutting them off from much of their revenues.Companies are now regrouping around the UK and continental Europe, hoping a more benign regulatory climate will enable them to take risk out of their operations.But they now face stiff competition from US companies who have up to now failed to engage in online gaming.LVS’s move follows the acquisition by Harrah’s, its Las Vegas rival, of London Clubs International, its first foray in the UK gambling market. Harrah’s took control of LCI, which has seven casinos in the UK, in October after a bid of around $570m.
189;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-10-10T20:47:02Z;Singapore casino bids;;The online gambling industry may be in disarray but in the physical world the stakes just keep getting bigger. A clutch of international gaming groups on Tuesday submitted bids to run Singapore’s second casino: a US$3bn or so mega-complex aimed at wooing tourists to squeaky-clean Lion City.Singapore wants to boost its economy – it hopes its two complexes will add 0.8 per cent to gross domestic product and create 30,000 jobs. Gaming companies, meanwhile, are looking to Asian gamblers to augment flagging US revenues. Already, the industry is moving eastwards: Macau, a special economic zone in China, is poised to overtake the Las Vegas strip as the world’s top gambling centre, possibly this year. Others, such as Thailand, plan to follow Singapore.More tables improve returns for the operators, as Macau’s erstwhile monopoly operator has discovered. By the time Singapore’s casinos are up and running, Macau – its skyline now emblazoned with the names of Las Vegas Sands and gambling tycoon Steve Wynn – is forecast to have 4,500 tables. That is more than double today’s number. Financially, too, Singapore is a longer-term investment. Las Vegas Sands, which will operate Singapore’s first casino, is counting on a five to eight-year payback period, more than double Macau’s time frame.Companies such as Eighth Wonder, operator of Las Vegas’ New York New York resort and one of the bidders in Singapore, hope the continued relaxation of tourism restrictions in mainland China will sustain growth. The mainland is home to roughly half of Macau’s gamblers, helping to fuel annual revenue growth of about 15 per cent. Singapore’s new resort will not be entirely dependent on gambling: one bid includes a Universal Studios theme park. However, with upfront investment levels now comparing unfavourably to Macau, and the risk of Asian market saturation, Singapore and its investors may regret being late to the table.
190;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-09-10T21:52:40Z;Wynn places firm bet on Macao future;;Steve Wynn, the US gaming mogul, plans to open the second phase of his new casino in Macao seven months ahead of schedule despite growing fears that a large number of new developments in the former Portuguese colony is creating excess supply.Mr Wynn said expansion of the US$1.2bn Wynn Macau, the first Las Vegas-style resort in Macao, would be launched in two stages in February and June next year, instead of in September 2007 as initially expected. The first phase of Wynn Macau, with 600 hotel rooms and 200 gaming tables, opened last week.“We need the capacity,” Mr Wynn told the FT. “We accelerated it about four weeks ago. We put Leighton-China State [the project’s construction management company] on overtime, 24-hour schedules.”The speeding up of the expansion underlines Mr Wynn’s confidence in Macao’s gaming market, which is expected to overtake the Las Vegas strip as the world’s largest as early as this year.But as casino operators such as Mr Wynn and Sheldon Adelson of Las Vegas Sands continue to place big bets on Macao, with the number of gaming tables expected to double from 2,800 this year to 6,400 in 2008, concerns about excess supply are growing.Chinese visitors, who make up of the bulk of Macao’s tourists, are perceived to be willing to spend money at the gambling tables, but not necessarily in luxury hotels and plush restaurants. Mr Wynn, however, is not concerned.“Someone said to me ‘How do you jump from Las Vegas to China?’ as if there was a Las Vegas thing and a Chinese thing. People who are upscale and mobile all want the same things. They want good shopping, good restaurants and good environment. What’s the mystery?” he asked.Mr Wynn is the second foreign investor to have opened casinos in Macao since the gaming industry was liberalised there in 2002. Mr Adelson, who opened the Sands Macao in 2004, is building a US$2.3bn mega-resort – the Venetian Macao – on Cotai, an area of reclaimed land between Macao’s two islands that is being developed into Asia’s Las Vegas.Mr Wynn is also planning a project on Cotai. He declined to reveal details of the new development, but did not rule out collaborating with other casino operators, such as PBL-Melco, a joint venture between James Packer’s Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, and Hong Kong’s Melco, controlled by Lawrence Ho.
191;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-09-05T18:59:05Z;US casino moguls target Macao;;"Arriving fashionably late, Stanley Ho sauntered up to his front-row seat. It was May 2004 and the tycoon who for four decades had monopolised Macao’s gambling industry was encountering his first real taste of competition.Mr Ho, one of 30,000 people who flocked to the opening of Sheldon Adelson’s Sands Macao casino, seemed anything but worried. His entrance, a few minutes after Mr Adelson had begun his opening speech, obliged the self-made American billionaire to interrupt the ceremony and welcome his rival.Two years on, Mr Ho does appear anxious, extremely so. In a series of recent public comments, he has described gaming competition in the former Portuguese colony as out of control, said the operators of his VIP gambling halls were struggling and even suggested that Macao’s “social stability” now hung in the balance. Mr Ho, scion of a rich Eurasian family from Hong Kong, has learnt the hard way that Mr Adelson, who grew up on the mean streets of Boston, is a tough operator.Last night brought another opening, another competitor: now Mr Ho has to reckon with Steve Wynn’s $1.2bn (£634m, €937m) Wynn Macau, too. But even Mr Wynn’s gambit – the territory’s first modern “integrated” resort and casino, with 600 suites and 220 tables in its first phase – pales in comparison to what Mr Adelson is planning next. That is the $2.3bn Venetian Macao, a 3,000 suite, 750-table mega-resort due to start trading in the middle of next year.The chips are thus down for what promises to be an epic clash between two of Las Vegas’ leading moguls – whose antipathy for each other is already the stuff of legend – and one of Asia’s most vibrant tycoons. The stakes, too, are appropriately huge: Macao is poised, perhaps by the end of the year, to eclipse the famed Las Vegas Strip as the world’s largest gambling market. Casino operators in the Chinese territory booked gross revenues of $3.1bn in the first half, only just behind the $3.3bn on the Strip.For Macao and Hong Kong, its sister special administrative region across the Pearl River Delta, the showdown is unprecedented in both style and substance. As between Mr Adelson and Mr Wynn, who in the US have warred over everything from parking spaces and the decibel levels of competing attractions to bank financing, there is also little love lost among the dozen or so families that dominate economic and political life in Macao and Hong Kong.But their feuds are usually quiet ones and the fiefdoms they control tend to be secure. The battle pitting Mr Adelson, Mr Wynn, Mr Ho and a handful of lesser-known characters against each other is not only a very public one, it will also be a competitive
free-for-all.Responding to Mr Ho’s gripes, Mr Adelson advised those who “can’t stand the heat [to] get out of the kitchen”. That drew a vigorous riposte from Mr Ho: “I not only won’t stay out of the kitchen, I will also cook a barbecue rice set and whoever comes to my hotel will receive a dish. Chinese kitchens are hot and our cuisine is the best.”According to CLSA, the Asian brokerage house, by the end of 2007 the number of gambling tables in Macao will more than triple to 4,300 from 1,400 at the end of last year. Over the same period, hotel rooms will increase 63 per cent to 17,200. “What Las Vegas built in 40 years, Macao will build in 10,” says Prentice Salter, a former executive of Mr Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands group who is now with Superesorts, a Macao-based consultancy.Macao’s growth has come amid a relaxation of travel restrictions for mainland Chinese over the past few years. With growing wealth and an itch to gamble, mainlanders have been the biggest supporters of Macao’s transformation from a gambling den to Asia’s Las Vegas.Indeed, before the Sands Macao opened, gambling in the territory was a dreary affair for most. While the high-
rolling punters known as “whales” were pampered in VIP suites, ordinary punters crowded into dingy smoke-filled halls operated by Mr Ho’s flagship Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macao and its sub-licensees.According to estimates by Credit Suisse analysts, prior to liberalisation almost 80 per cent of Macao casino revenues flowed from VIP baccarat and annual net gaming wins per table were in excess of $8m. Comparable per-table figures for casinos in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Malaysia and Australia ranged between $500,000 and $1.5m.The Sands Macao injected glamour into the city. Its high ceilings, spaceship design, restaurants, long bar and floor shows attracted gamblers in droves. “What the Sands tapped was an unrecognised reservoir of demand,” says one Macao-based industry executive. “It’s the buzz around the place that attracts people – and the Chinese like to go where the luck is.”Built at a cost of $265m, the casino booked operating income of $541m in its first two years. Already the world’s biggest casino in terms of tables, last month it opened a $99m expansion that increased its capacity by more than 50 per cent to 740 tables.Because the Sands Macao initially attracted relatively low-rollers, it was a wake-up call for Mr Ho but no big threat to his VIP gaming income. However, the Sands Macao is now making inroads into this segment as well. Two years after the Sands Macao opened, Mr Ho’s market share of gaming revenue in the VIP segment has fallen to 70 per cent.According to Mr Ho, the Sands Macao destabilised the industry by increasing the standard commission rate paid to so-called junkets, organisers whose job it is to “harpoon” the whales and other affluent players and bring them to a company’s VIP halls.Las Vegas Sands executives acknowledge that their junkets earn more than those working for Sociedade de Jogos de Macao, Mr Ho’s gaming operation, but say this is because of inefficiencies inherent in SJM’s business model. Mr Ho, they argue, franchises his VIP rooms to independent operators, who then split the 1.1 per cent commission with the junkets. The Sands Macao pays the same rate but, because it operates its VIP rooms in-house, the junkets get the commission outright.“The difference is Stanley’s middlemen,” says William Weidner, president of Las Vegas Sands and Mr Adelson’s right-hand man. “His commissions don’t get to the field reps. They are all taken by the people in the middle.”“The Macao government wanted competition – we’re competition,” adds Mr Adelson. “We live in a competitive environment [in Las Vegas] where there are over 100 casinos. We have to compete. If we don’t compete we don’t survive. The junkets bring the business to us because they get the whole 1.1 per cent. They don’t have to do business with an intermediary.”But SJM sees no need to change its business model. “We have been here for a very long time. We know what is a good model and what works for us. We know the market and our customers very well. I don’t think there need to be any changes for the moment,” says Ambrose So, SJM’s director and Mr Ho’s right-hand man.While Mr Ho’s baccarat chips may be down, he has at least two more cards to play. The first is his $385m Grand Lisboa casino, an 800-room, 200-table project being built across the street from his iconic Lisboa hotel and casino. Its casino portion is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter.“The Grand Lisboa is the key that will determine whether Stanley Ho can really compete with Sands and Wynn,” says one Hong Kong-based industry analyst. “It will be very negative if it doesn’t do well.”Nor will Mr Ho, who has married four times and has 17 children, be taking on the likes of Mr Adelson and Mr Wynn alone. His daughter Pansy is involved in a 247-table casino and resort joint venture with MGM Mirage of the US. His son Lawrence has joined forces with James Packer’s Publishing and Broadcasting to develop three projects worth $1.7bn.Mr Ho’s other potential trump card is that he still owns at least half of Macao. Either directly or through Shun Tak Holdings, his Hong Kong-listed company, Mr Ho controls stakes in 16 casinos, Macao’s dominant ferry company and helicopter service, its duty-free monopoly, the territory’s airport, its flag carrier, its only short-range budget airline and many hotels.“There are a lot of things we can’t do that Stanley Ho does,” Mr Adelson says. “We don’t own ferries. We don’t operate [Macao’s] ferry terminal.”“Stanley Ho had an integrated resort before we even invented the term,” adds Mr Salter, referring to the shops, restaurants and other amenities that have fed, and fed off, the crowds making their way to the Lisboa hotel and casino since it opened in 1970. “It’s not like he’s asleep at the wheel.”Nonetheless, it is at the roulette wheel, the baccarat table and other games of chance that Mr Ho will have to hope that luck, and the profit it generates, stays on his side."
192;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-08-28T21:05:34Z;Sands chief says Macao fight to intensify;;Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino mogul, on Monday warned Stanley Ho and other gaming operators in Macao that competition in the world’s second largest casino market has only just begun and would intensify.“If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen,” said Mr Adelson, chairman and chief executive of Las Vegas Sands.Visiting the former Portuguese enclave to mark the topping off of his company’s $2.3bn Venetian Macao resort, Mr Adelson was responding to Mr Ho’s complaints earlier this month that the Las Vegas Sands’ first operation there – the Sands Macao – was squeezing his casinos.Mr Ho, who enjoyed a monopoly in Macao’s gaming industry for 40 years until 2002, said the Sands Macao raised the commissions it paid to junket operators, whose job it is to round up high-rollers for Macao casinos. As a result, many of his VIP halls were having difficulty maintaining their business.Junket agents earn an estimated 0.75 per cent to 1.1 per cent commission on the value of chips purchased by the gamblers they bring in.William Weidner, Las Vegas Sands president and Mr Adelson’s right-hand man, countered that Mr Ho had only himself to blame, criticising the tycoon’s business model and denying that the Sands paid higher junket commissions.“The difference is Stanley’s middlemen,” Mr Weidner said. “His commissions don’t get to the field reps. They are all taken by the people in the middle.”As competition intensifies with the opening of more casinos – including the launch of Steve Wynn’s first project in Macao next week – Mr Weidner warned that Mr Ho’s system of having layers of agents could not last.Las Vegas Sands, the first foreign investor to enter Macao’s gaming industry in 2004, has transformed the market with the Sands Macao, a world-class casino that appeals to the mass market. The 700-table Venetian Macao, a Las Vegas-style resort, is due to open next summer.The market share of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, Mr Ho’s gaming flagship targeted at VIPs, has since fallen from about 85 per cent to 70 per cent.
193;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-08-28T20:58:14Z;Wall Street gains buoyed by falling oil;;Wall Street closed higher on Monday in a broad-based rally, buoyed by a fallback in the price of oil.Google and Ebay rose after they announced an alliance on Monday. Google will sell text-based advertising on Ebay websites outside the US, echoing a similar deal Ebay reached with Yahoo this year. Ebay rose 1.9 per cent to $25.79 on the news. Google gained 2.1 per cent to $380.95.Other technology stocks advanced. Dell climbed 2.1 per cent to $22.21 and Intel added 2.5 per cent to $19.38. Apple Computer, however, fell 2.6 per cent to $66.98, and software maker Red Hat lost 3.5 per cent to $24.56 on fears that falling computer server sales would depress Red Hat’s subscriber growth.Amazon gained 3.1 per cent to $28.91 after the online retailer announced plans to buy back up to $500m of stock.Chicago Mercantile Exchange continued to fall, losing 2.5 per cent to $437.25. The stock has lost more than 10 per cent in the past three weeks.The energy sector was sluggish. Crude prices fell back to $70.61 a barrel after forecasts suggested that tropical storm Ernestowould not hit oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Valero Energy fell 3.2 per cent to $60.39 and Marathon Oil dropped 2.7 per cent to $89.67.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent, or 6.69 points, at 1,301.78. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1 per cent, or 20.41 points, at 2,160.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent, or 67.96 points, to 11,352.01.Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck, said the fallback in crude was supporting a relief rally. “I would put it squarely on the price of oil.”But Mr Battipaglia did not believe there were any other catalysts to sustain the rally.“I do not see the wherewithal for a sustained rally. Volume is not explosive, and it isn’t an extraordinary move across key sectors,” he said.Consumer stocks gained as investors bet lower oil prices would buoy consumer spending, while robust August sales figures from Wal-Mart fuelled fresh hopes of resilience in the consumer sector.Toymaker Mattel rose 4.6 per cent to $18.73, and casino operator Las Vegas Sands jumped 4.6 per cent to $69.30.Airlines were also boosted by the fall in oil prices. American Airlines parent AMR added 2.7 per cent to $19.92, while Southwest rose 2 per cent to $17.29.Chipmaker Nvidia jumped 3.4 per cent to $27.39 after Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co raised its rating from “underperform” to “outperform”. It has gained 57 per cent in the past six weeks.Rohm & Haas, a maker of acrylics used in paints, sank 2.8 per cent to $42.77 – a nine month low – after it was cut from “buy” to “hold” by Citigroup, which said a slowing housing market was likely to hurt paint-related industries.
194;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-08-23T13:30:24Z;Casino battle heats up in Macao;;The Las Vegas Sands on Wednesday upped the ante in its high-stakes battle with tycoon Stanley Ho for dominance over Macao’s gaming market, opening a $100m expansion of its Sands Macao casino – the world’s largest with more than 700 tables.The move comes less than two weeks after Mr Ho complained publicly about the competition arising from the 2002 liberalisation of Macao’s gambling industry, in comments that have riveted the former Portuguese enclave.Competition will further intensify on September 6, when Steve Wynn, the US gaming magnate, opens his first casino in the territory. Featuring a 600-room hotel, Wynn Macao will be the territory’s first truly integrated casino and resort project.“What was already the largest casino in the world just became larger,” Mark Brown, Sands Macao president, said on Wednesday as he unveiled the 250-table expansion that will increase the casino’s capacity by more than 50 per cent to 710 tables. Mr Brown, former chief executive of Trump Entertainment Resorts in Atlantic City, New Jersey, moved to Asia in April to assume control of operations at the Sands Macao.The Las Vegas Sands, Controlled by Sheldon Adelson, is investing another $2.3bn in The Venetian Macao, a 700-table casino and integrated resort facility that is scheduled to open in the middle of next year.Mr Adelson’s lieutenants would not be drawn on the recent comments by Mr Ho. The tycoon said that competition from the Sands was putting pressure on his bread-and-butter VIP gaming operations, threatening both job losses and “social stability” in the territory.However, in a low-key ceremony held to mark the expansion’s formal opening, Mr Brown and Walter Power, Sands Macao’s vice president of operations, emphasised the job creation and promotion opportunities created by their company’s investments. After the expansion, the casino’s pay-roll will increase 25 per cent to some 8,000 employees, 85 per cent of whom hail from Macao.The market share of Mr Ho’s gambling flagship, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, has fallen from about 85 per cent to 70 per cent since the Sands Macao opened in May 2004. According to statistics compiled by Macao’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, gross revenues from VIP baccarat – the game of choice in Mr Ho’s VIP halls – declined slightly last year after years of 25-35 per cent growth.Mr Ho’s complaint has engendered little sympathy in Macao, where liberalisation of the gaming industry has sparked a frenzy of construction.“I’d expect a man in Mr Ho’s position to say something like that – his business is under a lot of pressure,” said one gambling industry executive.“The Monopoly game is over,” added an executive at one of Macao’s five-star hotels, which have lost market share to cheaper competitors serving the influx of thrifty Chinese tour groups.
195;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-08-23T12:57:24Z;Macao;;"The tables are turning in Macao, Asia’s top gambling den, which now rivals Las Vegas in size. Given their mature domestic market, US casino operators began placing big bets on China’s only legal gambling market after it liberalised in 2002.Las Vegas Sands is spending $12bn-$15bn in Macao and next month industry veteran Steve Wynn will open his first casino. That has shortened the odds for local tycoon Stanley Ho, who had long monopolised Macao’s tables.In an echo of its gangland reputation, the territory has experienced the first murder of a casino manager since 1996. Still, newcomers can take comfort that Macao’s government will be quick to crack down on organised crime, not least since gambling and taxes contribute 70 per cent of its revenues.There are fewer assurances on the competitive landscape. Macao now has 21 casinos with 2,000 gaming tables; come 2010, that will more than double to 4,500. New entrants are piling in all the time, wowed by speedy break-even times and proximity to mainland China, home to some of the world’s biggest gamblers. External competition is escalating as other Asian governments latch onto casinos as a potential economic stimulus. Some US operators are hedging their bets: Sands, for example, is also investing in Singapore.There are other reasons why Macao could sour. These include constraints such as labour (the population is below 500,000). Gaming taxes are far higher than in Las Vegas. Macao’s bread-and-butter Chinese gamblers have traditionally been the high-rollers; the burgeoning mass market requires different skills and infrastructure. Shares of companies operating in Macao are among the most expensive in the gaming universe – Hong Kong-based Melco trades at almost 50 times next year’s estimated earnings. Blackjack players are not the only ones taking a punt."
196;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-08-15T15:38:24Z;Market insight: Casino investors bet on Asia for trump card;;"The recent arrest in America of David Carruthers, chief executive of the London-based online gambling site BetonSports, illustrated a peculiarity about gambling in the US.Although America has no shortage of casino companies, it is European businesses that are hoovering up revenue from sports betting, which is still illegal in the US.However, US gaming companies do not appear to be suffering severely from this particular loss of revenue – they are still growing domestically and abroad.This growth has not escaped the attention of investors. Shares in casino operator Harrah’s Entertainment have doubled since the start of 2003, while MGM Mirage has more than tripled. By contrast, the S&P 500 gained 45 per cent in the same period.“The long-term performance [of casino stocks] has been very strong,” says Tom Graves, gaming analyst with Standard & Poor’s.Part of the growth has been driven by the building of more casinos during the 1990s, a move driven in part by cash-strapped states seeking a new source of revenue. “Usually what we see are periods of expansion [of gaming licences] in the US when there are budgetary issues at the state level,” says William Lerner at Deutsche Bank.Mr Graves believes other factors also play a role. “It’s tax revenue, its tourism revenue and its jobs,” he says.The result is that casinos have become cash cows for impecunious states.“In states that already have gambling, those taxes from gambling became one of the top three to five sources of revenue,” says Harry Curtis who covers the sector for JPMorgan.With the continued reliance of local government on casino-generated taxes and increasing demand from consumers, casinos have been able to increase revenue growth at home. Las Vegas still provides major muscle for the industry as it has learned to branch out beyond its traditional role as a destination for gamblers.“Traditional convention cities like New York and Chicago are losing share to Las Vegas. It’s less expensive, it’s easier to get to, and many people think its more fun,” says Harry Curtis.The result is more footfall through Las Vegas’s casinos as the city attracts more visitors
who might not have made the trip solely to gamble.Outside of Las Vegas, in local markets in the US, growth has been driven by refitting and sprucing up regional casinos that had been traditionally viewed as low-rent offerings.“They’re not grimy places with low ceilings and cigarette smoke,” says Mr Lerner.Steve Kent of Goldman Sachs agrees. “Visiting a riverboat casino or one in Atlantic city, you will notice the quality of the casino is better,” he says.However, Mr Kent thinks the real growth opportunities do not come from increasing volume in pre-existing casinos. “Casinos need either new markets or new buildings to stay in high growth,” he says. “Same-store sales will only get you so far. The biggest driver of revenue is new capacity being added.”For this reason, casino companies are increasingly looking overseas to drive growth. “International markets have really opened up, in particular in Macau,” says Mr Kent. “Over time, the majority of revenue for Las Vegas Sands will come from Asia.”Shares in Las Vegas Sands are up 59 per cent year-to-date. The company has staked a lot on the Asian market and its stock surged in May after it won a licence to open a casino in Singapore. It already operates one in Macau, and will be joined by Wynn’s, which is opening a casino there next month.Las Vegas Sands company is currently trading at 47 times forward earnings, significantly ahead of MGM Mirage at 20, and Harrah’s, which has a price-earnings multiple of 17 times.“It’s a very big deal,” says Mr Curtis. “Macau is the only legalised gambling venue for China. The Chinese government is now allowing travel to Macau and Hong Kong for mainland Chinese without a visa.”Joe Greff, gaming analyst at Bear Stearns, says: “I think broadly speaking, growth in the US is going to slow. We see more growth in Asia.”"

Las Vegas Sands posted solid profit growth thanks to a strong performance at its Macau casino, but revenue fell below analysts’ expectations, pushing shares down 6.9 per cent to $60.81.MGM Mirage also sold off, losing 7.1 per cent to $35.31, after second-quarter earnings fell shy of Wall Street forecasts.
198;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-08-02T20:56:31Z;Wall Street gains on robust earnings;;US markets closed higher on Wednesday as investors were cheered by robust earnings news.Procter & Gamble reported a 36 per cent jump in fiscal fourth quarter profit, just ahead of analyst expectations, pushing its shares up 4.2 per cent to a three-month high of $58.29.TimeWarner added 2.6 per cent to $16.67 after it beat Wall Street estimates by reporting $1bn in profit in the second quarter, up from a loss of $409m in the same period last year.Health insurer Cigna leapt 10.2 per cent to $102.10 after beating analysts’ estimates with its second quarter results and raising its full-year forecast.The news pulled other insurers higher.

199;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Las Vegas Sands to put $8bn in China;;Las Vegas Sands is planning to invest more than $8bn in its casino, leisure and convention facilities in Macao and on a neighbouring island over the next four to six years.The size of the investment, double that reported originally, is part of the US-based gaming company’s plans to change the face of the former Portuguese enclave’s tourism industry from offering one-day gambling trips to becoming a longer-stay destination.Bill Weidner, Las Vegas Sands president and chief operating officer, said: “These development opportunities are contingent upon approvals by government at several levels and will occur in phases over time as the markets develop and mature.”The company’s plans for Macao follow its success in Singapore, where it has won the rights to build and operate the $3.6bn Marina Bay casino complex, scheduled to open in 2009.Analysts say both investments should allow it to dominate Asia’s two largest casino markets: the greater China market, which Merrill Lynch this year estimated to be worth $7.3bn in sales, and the $3.8bn south-east Asian market.Mr Weidner said the US company’s total investments and turnover would triple as a result of its initiatives in Asia.“Most of the company’s investments and revenues will be in Asia,” he said.In Singapore and Macao, the company is seeking to emulate its business model in Las Vegas, where industry-wide non-gaming revenues last year, at $9.2bn, outstripped casino sales of $6.3bn.In Macao, the company plans to spend $3bn each in two phases on the Cotai Strip. The company is also in talks to develop Heng Qin island, a Chinese island bordering the Cotai Strip.
200;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;On Asia: Foreign investors flock to Singapore;;Shortly before he was arrested in Tokyo for insider trading, Yoshiaki Murakami, Japan’s famed “shareholder activist”, bought a lavish penthouse in Singapore for S$16m ($10m) as he moved his controversial management fund to the city-state.The St Regis Residences, which will adjoin the St Regis Hotel near Singapore’s shopping mecca on Orchard Road, has been posting record sales for luxury accommodation even before it is built. Foreign investors, including buyers from India and the Middle East, have been paying S$4m-S$19m for the upscale apartments.The boom in local luxury home prices, after a decade-long property slump, and a sharp rise in top-end rents fuelled by the return of expatriates, is seen as an indicator that Singapore’s financial markets could prove to be a safe haven over the next several years.Foreigners are buying landmarks such as the Raffles Hotel. Las Vegas Sands has been selected to build and operate Singapore’s first casino resort, which is expected to boost residential sales as the government seeks to make Singapore a “global city” with international appeal.Fund managers are dismissing the recent drop in the Straits Times Index as a short-term market correction reflecting global trends. The STI has fallen 11.5 per cent since hitting a record high of 2,666.33 on May 3, although it remains south-east Asia’s second best performing market this year after Indonesia.Analysts think attention should be focused on Singapore’s expanding private bank and asset management sectors, which are attracting rich investors to the city-state. Singapore is making a concerted effort to woo funds from Middle East investors, flush with cash from high oil prices, by offering a new range of Islamic financial products.Christopher Wood, regional strategist for CLSA, thinks one reason for the high-end property boom is that private bankers are persuading clients to bid for new residential projects because of Singapore’s low-risk environment and expectations that the Singapore dollar could become “the Swiss franc of Asia”. The rapid growth of Singapore’s private banking industry, a response to the European Union’s crackdown on European tax havens, “implies long-term appreciation of the Singapore dollar. For as the inevitable disintegration of the US dollar paper standard draws ever nearer, the private banking clients will need a new reference currency,” said Mr Wood in a recent report.A stronger currency suggests that overseas investors who buy Singapore-listed shares will enjoy foreign exchange gains in the years ahead. There are also signs of increased merger and acquisition activity as foreigners flock to buy Singapore assets.Indonesia’s Lippo Group has taken stakes in retailer Robinson & Co and property developer Overseas Union Enterprises. Japan’s Tokio Marine acquired insurer Asia General Holdings, while Australia’s Toll Holdings recently took over SembCorp Logistics.More asset sales are expected, particularly by Temasek Holdings, the state investment company that controls most of Singapore’s leading companies, including Singapore Airlines, Singapore Telecommunications and DBS Bank.Some of Singapore’s blue-chip shares, such as SingTel, are beginning to look like bargains after the six-week market slide and the promise of more hefty dividend payments ahead.Singapore’s attractions are underlined by the problems that Temasek faces as it ventures into emerging markets. While Temasek can claim a $3.2bn paper gain from the recent Bank of China initial public offering, it has fared less well on its investments in StanChart and Shin Corp.Shin Corp’s shares have dropped nearly 40 per cent since a Temasek-led consortium in January bought a controlling stake of 49.6 per cent for $1.9bn. The tumble in the share price reflects the political crisis that the deal triggered because of protests that the family of Thaksin Shinawatra, Thai prime minister, sold its Shin holdings without having to pay taxes on the proceeds.The value of Temasek’s stake in StanChart has dropped by 17 per cent since the deal was concluded in March, leaving Temasek with an estimated paper loss of £370m ($674). The share price has been hurt by global market turmoil and Temasek’s investment, which ended speculation about a takeover battle for the bank that had sent the share price up 60 per cent since March 2005.While investors are flocking to Singapore’s tropical climes, Temasek is finding that leaving home can be a chilling experience.
201;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
202;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-05-31T18:33:01Z;Lex: Asian gambling;;"International gaming companies are betting big on Asia. Las Vegas Sands, which is already spinning the wheel in Macao, Asia’s top gambling den, last week won the right to run Singapore’s maiden casino. Australia’s Publishing & Broadcasting is planning to list a gaming joint venture on Nasdaq, raising $1bn to help fund expansion across Asia.Putting money into Asian casinos looks a sure-fire bet. The region offers voracious demand and scant supply, largely due to the fact that gambling is barred in several countries. That has created huge opportunities for less puritanical administrations.Macao, poised to overtake Las Vegas as the world’s top gaming market this year, derives much of its income from Chinese and Hong Kong tourists who cannot gamble at home. Macao is a magnet for mass-market gamblers, who account for more than half of all gaming revenues. These day-trippers are good for business, with the average win per table roughly four times as big as that in Las Vegas.The trouble is that as casinos proliferate, the odds shorten. Singapore plans two casino resorts, and while the tiny island state’s ritzy ambitions may be good for itself – it expects to generate an additional 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product and 30,000 jobs – they are less so for Las Vegas Sands.The US gaming company reckons it will take five to eight years to recoup its $3.2bn-plus Singapore investment. That is reasonable by global standards but a far cry from Macao, where casinos break even in half that time, or even less. Fancier joints mean bloated costs and, going on Macao’s experience with high-end punters, more modest growth. New markets bring new challenges in areas like debt collection and staff compensation.

203;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-05-26T11:20:09Z;Singapore picks Las Vegas Sands to develop casino;;Las Vegas Sands, the US gaming group, was selected on Friday by Singapore to operate what was billed as the world?s most expensive casino.The project represents an effort by Singapore to shed its nanny-state image and attract more tourists as it competes with Macao to become one of Asia?s main gaming hubs.The $3.6bn complex, which will include convention and performance halls, shopping malls, a museum and a 2,500-room luxury hotel, is the centrepiece of plans to create a new central business and entertainment district that will be based around the city?s Marina Bay.But the large costs to build what Singapore calls its ?intergrated resort? has raised concerns whether it will attract enough visitors to support it when the government has placed strict limits on locals using the gaming facilities.Singaporeans will have to pay a S$100 a day levy if they want to gamble, which could limit the casino?s appeal. The government imposed the charge to curb betting among the local population.Religious groups had campaigned against the casino, saying it would cause widespread social problems. The decision to proceed with the project overturned a long-standing government policy to ban gaming facilities.Las Vegas Sands, the world?s biggest gaming group, was selected over three other competing bids by MGM Mirage, Harrah?s Entertainment and Malaysia?s Genting group to operate the casino on a 30-year concession.While two state-owned property developers supported rival bids, the Sands was advised by City Developments, Singapore?s biggest private-sector property group.It is the second big gaming investment in Asia by the Sands, which operates a casino in Macao in addition to the Venetian in Las Vegas.The casino is seeking to attract visitors from the rest of south-east Asia. But its biggest potential source of customers could come from China, where gambling is banned.Macao has become the main destination for Chinese gamblers, which has turned the former Portugese colony into the world?s biggest gaming centre outside of Las Vegas.But Singapore officials said the Sands could ?leverage? its strong operations in Macao to persuade customers to visit Singapore.Singapore faces stiff competition in the region?s $14bn gaming sector, with Thailand and other Asian countries proposing to relax rules on setting up casinos.The Marina Bay casino will the first of two in Singapore that are expected to open in 2009, with the second to be located on the resort island of Sentosa. The operator for the Sentosa casino will be selected later this year.The government said it wanted the casino to be an ?iconic? architectural landmark that would create ?a signature skyline? for Singapore.The winning design was by Moshe Safdie, a US-based architect whose projects included the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem. The project includes three 50-storey hotel towers that resemble decks of cards being shuffled and connected by a sweeping rooftop garden. The Sands said Clear Channel Entertainment, a Broadway producer, will provide high-profile acts for the resort.Other nearby attractions at Marina Bay will include a botanical garden and giant ferris wheel based on the London Eye.
204;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-04-25T00:37:28Z;Macao gaming draws new entrants;;A US investment fund and former Las Vegas gambling executive are teaming up to invest in a HK$15bn (US$1.9bn) resort and gaming complex in Macao in a bid to challenge the international casino operators in one of the world’s biggest gaming markets.Silver Point Capital, a Connecticut-based fund with US$5bn under management, and David Friedman, a former lieutenant of Las Vegas gaming magnate Sheldon Adelson, will invest up to HK$2.97bn for a 40 per cent stake in a project controlled by Hong Kong-listed eSun Holdings, the media and entertainment arm of property group Lai Sun Development.The partners plan to invest about HK$15bn in a casino resort on Macao’s Cotai Strip, which will have up to 500 gaming tables, 4,000 hotel rooms, a film studio and other exhibition facilities. The project is expected to open in 2009.Of the HK$15bn, HK$6bn will be paid to the Macao government for the 35-acre site.The partners, which have working capital of about US$800m, will raise the remainder of the fund through a number of ways, such as high-yield bonds.Macao’s gaming market, which had been monopolised by tycoon Stanley Ho, was liberalised in 2001.Gaming concessions have since been awarded to five additional companies including Mr Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts, MGM and Publishing & Broadcasting of Australia, all of which are building large casino and resort developments in the former Portuguese enclave.In order to operate a casino at its Studio City development, eSun and its partners said yesterday they were in negotiations with Macao’s established concession holders over a licensing arrangement.Such agreements are not uncommon in Macao. In most arrangements, companies pay about 20 per cent of their gaming revenue to the licence-holders in order to operate casinos in the enclave. Mr Friedman said yesterday the companies would seek a different agreement, but declined to give further details.As a top aide to Mr Adelson, Mr Friedman, who quit Las Vegas Sands in 2004, played a major role in the launch of Macao’s first foreign-operated casino, the Sands Macau.Earlier this month James Packer suggested the possibility of an alliance between PBL’s gaming joint venture and Melco, controlled by Mr Ho’s family, and Wynn Resorts.
205;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-03-30T19:40:48Z;Las Vegas Sands bids $3.6bn for Singapore resort;;Las Vegas Sands, a US casino operator, on Thursday unveiled a $3.6bn bid to build the first casino-resort in Singapore as it vies for a bigger slice of the burgeoning Asian gaming market.The Marina Bay Sands, as the project is to be called, would include 2,500 hotel rooms, shops, business convention space, high-end restaurants, theatres and a museum. It would open in 2009. The size of its shopping mall alone would be equivalent to five Wal-Mart super centres in terms of square footage.Las Vegas Sands owns the Venetian casino-resort in Las Vegas and opened the Sands Macao in 2004. Business has been booming for the first US-owned casino in the former Portuguese colony, which is the only place in Asia where gambling is legal.Fourth-quarter operating income at Sands Macao jumped 56 per cent to $93.3m against the previous year.Plans for the Singapore project underscore the evolution of casinos from gambling halls to full-scale resorts where gaming is just one component of entertainment.Strong growth in Las Vegas has been fuelled by the growth of non-gaming businesses – such as dining, shopping, shows and spas – over the past decade.In a controversial move, Singapore’s conservative government last year approved casino-resorts at two sites to boost tourism. Las Vegas Sands hopes to drive non-gaming revenues at Marina Bay Sands with “extensive entertainment programming . . . and an array of entertainment from south-east and north Asia”.The group is one of four contenders to submit its proposal.It is competing with Harrah’s and MGM Mirage, the world’s largest- and second-largest casinos, and Genting of Malaysia. With just two casinos, Las Vegas Sands is dwarfed by Harrah’s and MGM Mirage, but Las Vegas Sands has a head start in Asia with its success in Macao.
206;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-03-16T01:12:57Z;Hilton bets on operating resort hotels in Macao;;Hilton Hotels has become the latest international hotel chain to bet on a fundamental transformation of Macao’s gaming market from a playground for day-tripping punters into a fully-fledged resort destination.Hilton signed a “non-binding letter of intent” with Las Vegas Sands, controlled by gaming and convention magnate Sheldon Adelson, to operate a 1,200-room Hilton Hotel and a 600-room Conrad hotel and suite development at The Venetian Macao.The Venetian, a giant development under construction on Macao’s Cotai Strip, has signed similar deals with the Four Seasons group, Starwood’s Sheraton and St Regis chains, and tycoon Robert Kuok’s Shangri-La and Traders brand hotels.Macao’s casino industry has been growing at breakneck speed, with gaming revenues last year approaching those of Las Vegas, at about US$5.5bn.But unlike its US peer, the former Portuguese enclave has yet to develop the accommodation and other attractions to draw longer staying visitors.Including the latest Hilton agreement, The Venetian will boast 4,900 hotel rooms, compared with Macao’s stock of just 10,537 rooms as of the end of last year.By contrast, there are more than 134,000 rooms in Las Vegas.Prentice Salter, managing director of Macao-based consultancy Super Resorts, noted that “a majority of [Macao’s existing hotels] don’t come even close to the three-star level” and argued that Sands and other international gaming operators would change the face of Macao’s gaming industry.The Venetian is Sands’ second significant development in the former Portuguese enclave, where it operates the Macao Sands casino. Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts and James Packer’s Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd are also building casinos in Macao.According to Kenneth Tsang, head of South China research at Jones Lang LaSalle, visitors to Macao increased 12.2 per cent to 18.7m in 2005. The average stay was just 1.1 days as mainland tourists and Hong Kong gamblers popped in to try their luck at the tables.“Comdex was Adelson’s baby,” Mr Salter said, referring to iconic computer industry tradeshow that Mr Adelson launched in 1979 and sold to Japan’s Softbank Corp in 1995. “That’s his forte and one of the reasons he was invited to the party in Macao. These hotels are definitely needed.”However, Koos Klein, the Singapore-based head of Hilton’s Asia Pacific and Middle East operations, admitted the bet was no certainty. “The short answer is we don’t know [if Macao will change],” he said.
207;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-01-04T16:41:21Z;Four players left at the Marina Bay table;;"Singapore has taken a big gamble. The city-state’s decision last year to approve the $3bn Marina Bay project overturned a decades-long ban on casinos.The project, near Singapore’s central business district, quickly attracted interest from nearly 20 international gaming groups.But the loss this week of yet another high-profile bidder has raised questions about the attractiveness of Singapore’s first casino.The latest to drop out of the competition is a joint venture between Publishing and Broadcasting, the Australian media and gaming group controlled by the family of the late Kerry Packer, and Macao’s Melco International Development, owned by Stanley Ho.PBL-Melco’s departure leaves four groups competing for the Marina Bay casino. Marina Bay is the bigger of two casinos that Singapore plans to open in 2009, with the other on the resort island of Sentosa.Despite the dwindling pool of bidders, officials in Singapore insist they remain confident that the project will proceed as planned and that there are strong proposals still on the table from the remaining groups.Three of the remaining bidders are partnerships between US gaming groups and Singapore property developers, two of them state-owned.They include Harrah’s Entertainment and Keppel Land, MGM Mirage and CapitaLand, and Las Vegas Sands and City Developments.In addition, Genting, the Malaysian gaming group, is also interested as it seeks to expand outside its home base. It owns Singapore-listed Star Cruises, which offers gambling on its vessels in international waters.Singapore believes the casinos will attract more tourists and provide service jobs for unskilled workers as basic manufacturing mig-rates to China and Malaysia.The four remaining groups had always been considered among the favourites to win the concession, with several also expected to bid for Sentosa if they are eliminated from Marina Bay.Hannah’s, MGM Mirage and Las Vegas are among the world’s biggest gaming operators, while Genting has large cash reserves. Final bids for Marina Bay are expected to be submitted by March 31.Nonetheless, the shrinking shortlist of bidders underscores the competition that Singapore will face from Macao, which is rapidly emerging as Asia’s gambling centre.“Macao has a very well- established gaming market [which draws visitors from neighbouring China]”, says Karen Tang, a Deutsche Bank analyst in Hong Kong.PBL-Melco and Wynn Resorts dropped plans for Singapore because of previous investments committed to Macao. Several potential investors cited high costs associated with the Marina Bay casino for pulling out.Bidders are expected to invest US$2.5bn-$3bn for the Marina Bay, including US$720m to purchase the land. PBL-Melco says it believes expected returns would be “insufficient to justify the higher projected capital costs”.Singapore plans to introduce restrictions for its citizens in using the casinos, such as imposing a daily admission charge of S$100 (US$60) to discourage gambling among those less able to afford it.The conditions will make the casinos highly dependent on foreign tourists.Ms Tang estimates that the return on investment offered by the Singapore casinos will be in the mid-to-high teens against more than 40 per cent in Macao. “For US investors, the Singapore market could be attractive because the return on equity is in the low-teens at home. But for Macao operators, it may not be very appealing.”Singapore, meanwhile, says it is seeking to create an “iconic” architectural landmark at Marina Bay, including related convention and entertainment facilities that would amount to an “integrated resort”.The proposed participation of state-owned property developers CapitaLand and Keppel Land in the Marina Bay project underscores the government’s commitment.But the casinos represent a political gamble for
Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister, who pushed through the proposal in

208;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2006-01-03T18:36:48Z;PBL withdraws from Singapore casino bid;;Publishing and Broadcasting, the Australian media and gaming group, has withdrawn its joint bid with Macao’s Melco International Development to build Singapore’s first casino.The decision marks the company’s first significant business step since the death last week of Kerry Packer, Australia’s richest man and the group’s founder.Analysts had forecast that James Packer, who now heads the group, would continue to expand the casino and gaming business of PBL’s A$11.1bn (US$8.2bn) empire, a strategy that he has aggressively pursued since becoming executive chairman in 1998. However, in his first major statement since his father’s death, James Packer said on Tuesday: “Expected returns from the integrated resort are insufficient to justify the higher projected capital costs of the project.”The withdrawal from the PBL-Melco bid will leave four groups competing for the US$3bn Marina Bay casino site, the bigger of the two planned by Singapore. Contracts for the second site, on the resort island of Sentosa, will be awarded later.Three of the remaining Marina Bay bidders are partnerships between US gaming groups and Singapore property developers, two of them state-owned. They include Harrah’s Entertainment and Keppel Land, MGM Mirage and CapitaLand, and Las Vegas Sands and City Developments.Mr Packer on Tuesday insisted the group’s gaming strategy remained on track. PBL is set to continue to focus on developing opportunities throughout Asia in partnership with Melco, the group controlled by the family of Stanley Ho, the Macao casino billionaire.“We are enthusiastic about the potential for new casino projects as governments in the region liberalise gaming laws. Expansion beyond Australia and Macao remains an important strategy for both PBL and Melco,” Mr Packer said.The PBL-Melco joint venture, established in November 2004, is building a casino-hotel in Macao and is planning a large-scale integrated resort on the Cotai Strip to be known as the ‘City of Dreams’ .“It’s just a normal business decision they’ve taken,” said Greg Fraser, an analyst at Shaw Stockbroking. “And it’s not entirely surprising given the level of international competition.”Singapore lifted a ban on casinos in April 2005 to boost its share of Asia-Pacific tourists.Karen Tang, analyst at Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong, said the PBL/Melco decision to withdraw was “well thought of”, as the return on investment in Singapore was expected to be in the mid to high-teens only, compared with more than 40 per cent in Macao.

In 12 years since then, full-time after his retirement through injury in 1998, Rockett qualified as a chartered surveyor and has worked for SDG in Scarborough, Leeds and London.Rockett, 36, has now been named chief executive of Sheffield United, Aim-listed owner of the Championship- leading football club, and McCabe’s ‘other’ company.It’s his property expertise, not his football background, that got him there. McCabe is intent on establishing Sheffield United as a property and leisure company that funds its footballing ambitions.It’s a model that will be helped by, but does not rely on, McCabe’s plans to build a mega-casino. Sheffield United has a contract with Las Vegas Sands and, ahead of most of its rivals for casinos, planning consent.Capacity at Bramall Lane is due to be 33,000 by next season, in the top dozen among Premiership clubs, among whose ranks McCabe hopes the Blades will be.Troc a blockGolfrate, the property investment company run by Asif Aziz, has plans to turn round the Trocadero Centre in Piccadilly Circus that it bought for £220m a few months ago. It is understood to be close to signing up Travelodge to run a 600-room hotel.The group has also spent about £150m buying a prominent building across the way – The Criterion, which houses the Criterion theatre and Lillywhites.Ready for milkingA champagne reception at St Stephen’s Club this week to toast the Conservative party’s most generous donors was over-subscribed, for the wrong reasons.The party’s chief fundraiser complained that with so many rival Tory leadership candidates crammed into the room there was not enough space to squeeze in the cash cows, donors from the party’s exclusive Team 2000.Mudlark hears that the protracted bun fight over the top job is scaring off contributors and means party finances are unlikely to be healthy by year-end.Call of the seaThe attention given to the bicentenary of Trafalgar may have overshadowed the success of SeaBritain2005, umbrella organisation for that and other celebrations of nautical heritage.SeaBritain is chaired by David Quarmby, former British Tourist Authority chairman and, in the more distant past, former joint managing director of J Sainsbury. Based at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, SeaBritain has operated on a virtual shoestring, only £750,000 over three years.Its secret, Quarmby explained ahead of a breakfast speech today at the Walbrook club, was to encourage local groups to organise their own celebrations. SeaBritain offered unified branding and a central website.SeaBritain will wind itself up after this year, but Quarmby is preparing a paper on the lessons of its ‘distributed’ model. There was a contrast, Mudlark noted, with a previous project, not far downstream, of which Quarmby briefly was chairman – the Dome. In fact, wasn’t the World’s Fair-style expo an outdated, 20th century concept?Quarmby reflected for a moment and said: “The idea of the millennium was too big to be able to be captured in one place.”But the Millennium Commission, although centrally funded, had encouraged local initiative in selecting the projects that would likely be a more lasting legacy of 2000. www.seabritain2005.comAs others see usThe Chinese company behind the biggest Ferris wheel in the world was probably trying to be nice.“The construction of observation wheels,” it said, “has become a window for many economic-focused cities of developing countries to show off their cultural, economic and high-tech standards.

210;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2005-09-20T20:40:14Z;Mudlark: Knight shows when it pays to say No;;"Angela Knight has been chief executive of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers since 1997, when she lost her seat as a Conservative MP and her ministerial role as economic secretary to the Treasury. Her victory on Tuesday on behalf of UK holders of Royal Dutch – although too late for those who had accepted the original offer – caps her highest-profile campaign.Other of her causes have had broader impact. Knight returned on Tuesday from speaking at a Channel Islands conference about the impact of European regulation. But Shell was important to Knight because it epitomised the peripheral treatment of individual shareholders.Hold-outs don’t always have such happy endings. Shareholders can be left with illiquid unlisted paper. In the case of Shell, with a reputation to look after, it was inevitable that a face-saving solution would be found. It’s odd that Shell’s advisers, who were paid $115m (£64m), didn’t think of it earlier.Dudley Eustace, chairman of Smith & Nephew, has topped up his stake in the medical devices maker with a £72,000 share purchase.The shares, which cost him 490p each, would have been more than 50p dearer before last week’s trading statement that blamed hurricane Katrina, in part, for slower sales growth in knee-replacement products.Eustace, of course, could not have dealt before the trading statement and could only buy or sell before September 30, when the company’s close season begins. Hurricane season, incidentally, lasts another two months after that.Las Vegas Sands, the US casino operator that on Tuesday obtained planning permission from Glasgow City Council for a £200m development, including a super casino beside the Ibrox home of Rangers Football Club, knows it has a battle on its hands to beat Blackpool if the government allows only one such gambling emporium.It will have an even tougher struggle to attract any Celtic supporters.While insisting fans of all clubs will be welcome, the Americans realise a complex that features a superstore displaying Rangers trophies and memorabilia will be a distinct no-go area for some.They say they have had similar discussions with Celtic FC concerning its Parkhead ground, but “nothing is on the table”.Including no wagers on Ibrox gaming tables from anyone who favours the green and white, Mudlark can confidently predict.Did Sir Terry Leahy sound grumpy on Tuesday, in spite of Tesco’s industry-beating first-half performance? Several people noticed it.Could it be related to the current form of his beloved Everton, lying second from bottom of the Premiership and 5-1 down after the first leg of a Uefa Cup tie against Dinamo Bucharest?What’s Somerfield up to? The supermarket chain is sending cards, unsolicited, to selected journalists offering 10 per cent discounts on their grocery shopping for three months.No such effort was made to seduce Mudlark; perhaps Somerfield has noticed from rivals’ experience what happens when Mudlark turns his laser gaze on supermarket shelves.“This appears to be a rush of overenthusiasm and naivety,” commented Somerfield’s urbane PR adviser, who – Mudlark suspects – rarely frequents the aisles of his client, whatever the discount.SABMiller, the UK-listed brewer, is celebrating its South American acquisition, Bavaria, with a Latin American-themed drinks reception in December.To help guests mark the date, it has sent each a replica of a Peruvian vessel flute (below). There’s also a reference, though, to lifting “people to a higher state of consciousness”. They can’t say they weren’t warned.mudlark@ft.com"
211;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2005-08-26T18:12:43Z;Christopher Caldwell: US’s bluff on gambling;;"Gambling is a hot business in the US. The initial public offering last December of the Las Vegas Sands casino was immensely profitable, evoking comparisons to the big high-technology IPOs of the 1990s. If the published estimates are reliable, American gambling is an $80bn (€65bn) business, more lucrative than sports, movies and music combined. The US, of course, is not alone in its recent betting boom. PartyGaming, the online gambling service based in Gibraltar, was on the threshold of blue-chip status from the moment it was floated for £5.6bn (€8.2bn) in London in June and similar online start-ups are thriving in Sweden, Asia and the Caribbean. That the US does not have a piece of this business may teach it a lesson.Because where the US is very much alone is in the illogic of its gambling regime and the disingenuousness and sanctimony with which politicians defend it. Thirty years ago, Gambling was illegal in 49 of 50 American states 30 years ago. Today, all but two of them allow gambling in some form. Most states are fiscally dependent on public lotteries (what used to be called “numbers rackets”) and special casino taxes. These cover an increasing part of the budget, or simply shift the tax burden from all citizens on to those who gamble – particularly those who do so compulsively. Advocates of gambling like to claim that betting has been used to raise revenue throughout American history. This is true only in the most restricted sense – holding a raffle to buy uniforms for the local youth baseball team, for instance. Only since the 1970s have states made gambling a budgetary mainstay. A number of recent political scandals have brought to light the extent to which Washington lobbyists have profited from the gambling business. But state governments now rely upon gambling so heavily that to abandon it would wreak fiscal havoc.Gambling began creeping back into American life only in the 1970s. Perhaps due to a vestigial Puritanism, its advocates began to claim that gambling served a high moral purpose. The purpose settled on was to provide economic opportunity for American Indians. There are now about 400 tribal gambling areas in the country. The 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act permitted the opening of casinos on Indian reservations on the grounds that, since the tribes were sovereign there, gambling could take place without violating state laws. The result was a clamour for tribal status from small (and hitherto unheard-of) Indian groups. One such was the Mashantucket Pequot, who run Foxwoods,
one of two big casinos in Connecticut that receive at least 20m patrons a year. The casinos pay $420m a year – 25 per cent of slot machine revenues – to the state. If the tribes are as sovereign as the official rationale claims, it is not clear why they owe any money to the state of Connecticut at all.A more basic absurdity is that gambling in the US should be under the control of the states in the first place. It is Congress that regulates interstate commerce, and US gambling is interstate by design. States that have established casinos, whether through Indian intermediaries or under government aegis, are not simply finding an alternative way for their citizens to pay state taxes. They do not want their own citizens to pay taxes at all – they want the citizens of other states to pay them. As one economist told State Legislatures magazine: “If you can figure out a way to attract non-residents to your community to gamble, it can be economic development. If not, it’s just another thing for people to spend their money on.” That – and not the romance of paddle-wheel steamers – is why so many casinos are located on riverboats in the Mississippi River, which marks the border between many Midwestern states. Gambling has its benefits and its drawbacks. The benefits are money and jobs. The drawbacks are debt, bankruptcy and broken families. Infor instance, the newspapers of Nebraska, one often runs across laments that Iowa’s gambling revenues are particularly high in four locations where the two states meet. Iowa gets the income and the jobs. Nebraska gets the externalities: the bankruptcies and the broken families.Faced with this service-economy equivalent of dumping, many states unsurprisinglylegalise gambling as a defensive measure. But North Dakota several months ago decided it would go even a step further – it would become the first US state to legalise online gambling. That would allow it them to peel half a billion dollars out of the other 49 states, as an alternative to paying for the government services it consumes. At that point the justice department warned North Dakota that it considered online gambling illegal under the 1961 Interstate Wire Act. For now, none of the world’s 2,500 online gambling sites are on US soil.But this does not mean that Americans do not play virtual poker for high stakes. They do, which means that revenue is now flowing out of the US to Britain and Sweden and Antigua as fast as it flows from Nebraska to Iowa. Following the justice department’s lead, a number of US banks have banned the use of credit cards for gambling online, but the poker sites keep coming up with new instruments – from “electronic wallets” to foreign-issued credit cards – faster than American politicians can legislate against them. There is some poetic justice in this.One of two things is bound to happen to American gambling law in the age of online poker. Either new laws will explicitly permit it, so that US companies can compete in this boom area of the global economy. Or – more desirable and less likely – the outflow of unfortunate punters’ life savings to other countries will lead states to take a second look at the cost of funding government through gambling. This, one hopes, will lead
them to reconsider the scandalous practice of preying on the most vulnerable citizens of neighbouring jurisdictions, siphoning their money away

212;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Casinos take a bet on Macao;;"Just as homeowners are always on the look-out for good contractorsbuilders, so Bill Weidner, president of US casino operator Las Vegas Sands, found a feng shuimaster through a referral from a friend, Wing Chao, who is a head of design at Walt ­Disney.Las Vegas Sands wanted advice on the layout of its $260m Sands Macao casino, the first foreign casino to open on Macao, the tiny island that is Asia’s gambling hub.The master of feng shui, the Chinese design practice, warned against the angle of Sands Macao’s casino floor, which he said funnelled good luck out towards the water. Instead, he suggested a round beehive shape that would retain the casino’s “honey”.The company duly complied. “We can’t make a guailo mistake,” said Mr Weidner, using the a Cantonese term that translates roughly as “foreign devil”. “We can’t have people say that we don’t understand Chinese culture.”To meet projected demand in Macao, Las Vegas Sands is building a $2bn replica of its 3,000-room Venetian casino resort in Las Vegas, which is scheduled to open in 2007. And next month it will [September] break ground on an expansion of the Sands Macao, opened just last spring, that will add 65 per cent more capacity.The feng shui master, whose name Mr Weidner declined to disclose for competitive reasons, was called on again to advise on the Venetian in Macao. This time, the expert suggested that canals for the replica of St Mark’s Square should be realigned in relation to the sea and nixed vetoed the linear layout of the original plan. He also suggested that buildings should not protrude above surrounding mountains.Feng shui is just one example of Las Vegas Sands’ efforts to capture the Chinese market. It is ­betting its future on China with massive investment in Macao, the former Portuguese colony that is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal.The company this year announced plans for a $12bn-$15bn hotel, casino and retail development that it claims will transform Macao’s Cotai Strip into the Las Vegas of Asia within ten 10 years.“There is pent-up demand for more international growth,” says Mr Weidner. “There are hundreds of millions of mainland Chinese who are looking for extraordinary experiences.”Banc of America Securities estimates Macao’s gaming revenues will grow to $13bn-$16bn by 2010, eventually outstripping those of Las Vegas, which in 2004 stood at $6.8bn.Aside from good publicity, Mr Weidner says feng shui is both “a salute to Chinese culture and a defence mechanism” against criticism from local pundits.Yet competition is formidable in Macao. Stanley Ho, the Hong Kong gambling tycoon, held a 40-year monopoly over Macao’s gaming industry until the ­Chinese government agreed in 2001 to offer licences to international operators.Other US gaming companies are preparing to enter the market. MGM Mirage and Wynn Resorts, headed by US casino icon Steve Wynn, are both slated to open casinos in Macao.Before rivals open their doors, Las Vegas Sands is trying to deepen its foothold by catering heavily to local customs and taste.At Sands Macao, “tea boys” have replaced cocktail waitresses on the casino floor because Asians tend not to drink alcohol while they are ­gambling. Also, because food is central to Chinese culture, the new Venetian will have extensive “noodle capability” to feed hungry Asian gamblers, says Mr Weidner. The casino will have a plethora of noodle bars and 25 sit-down restaurants serving 40-50 varieties of noodles.Even the focus of gambling has changed in Macao. Slot machines, the main source of gambling revenue in US casinos, total 2,100 at the Venetian in Las Vegas while there are only 850 at Sands Macao.Chinese have an aversion to slot machines, known as lofugei or “tiger machines” because they “eat your body and spit out the bones”, so Las Vegas Sands has created special slot machines with a tiger-slaying theme.Sands Macao also offers 360 tables in contrast to 130 in Las Vegas because Asians favour table games, particularly high-stakes baccarat.As well as developing the gambling market in Asia, Las Vegas Sands also caters to Asian customers on its home turf. Chefs from Asia are routinely flown to Las Vegas to prepare authentic Asian cuisine.The most sumptuous room in the Venetian’s 3,600-room hotel in Las Vegas is reserved for gamblers with credit lines of at least $1m. a million dollars.These high-rollers typically hail from east Asia. The four-bedroom “chairman’s suite”, which boasts a fountain in the foyer, televisions in its marble showers and 24-hour butler service, has distinctly Asian décor, complete with silk bedspreads and Chinese screens.Macao’s success as a gambling hub is also important to China. Las Vegas Sands pays a tax of 39 per cent of gross revenue to the Chinese ­government.But some analysts worry that heady expectations for Macao could be unsustainable. Preliminary reports indicate that Macao’s gaming revenue last month [JULYcould be as much as 12 per cent lower than July last year. And tourism growth in Macao slowed from 40 per cent last year to 19 per cent in the first three months of 2005.There is also the question of what kind of profits can be reaped from the influx of relatively low-paid workers from mainland China.“Even if their gross income is lower, they have more disposable income,” insists Mr Weidner. “They have a higher propensity to play at different levels.”So far, efforts in Macao appear to be paying off.
Las Vegas Sands this month said earnings from Sands Macao offset weaker results at the Venetian in Las Vegas. But looking back at its design, Mr Weidner does have one regret.“We didn’t make the ­noodle bar big enough,” he laments.That’s one thing even the feng shui master didn’t ­predict."
213;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2005-06-01T15:47:48Z;MGM plans Macao growth;;MGM Mirage and its partner Pansy Ho, daughter of Hong Kong gambling tycoon Stanley Ho, on Wednesday signalled plans for a possible expansion of a US$1bn casino joint venture in Macao, despite suggestions that the former Portuguese colony may be in the throes of an unsustainable gaming bubble.“We are making preparations towards looking into our future expansion but there is nothing fixed,” Ms Ho said as MGM Grand Macao, 50:50 owned by MGM Mirage and Ms Ho, began construction of a casino with 300 gaming tables and a 600-room resort hotel.Ms Ho said the venture was close to securing a US$600m syndicated loan from a consortium of investment banks to help fund the US$975m project.MGM Grand Macao's project is the latest in a string of gambling investments in Macao, the only part of China where gaming is legal. Gaming revenues in the tiny enclave rose 44 per cent to US$5bn last year, mainly on the back of spending by tourists from the mainland.Las Vegas Sands, owner of the Venetian casino in Macao, announced plans in March for a US$12bn-US$15bn project that aims to turn Cotai, a reclaimed area in the territory, into Asia's Las Vegas within 10 years.Melco, a Hong Kong company controlled by Mr Ho, unveiled a HK$8bn project for the same area in May, to be built in partnership with Kerry Packer, Australia's richest man. Mr Ho said on Wednesday that Melco would announce another project in Cotai next month. Wynn Resorts is also investing more than US$1bn in Macao.However, some analysts have started to question whether the growth in gaming revenue is sustainable after Las Vegas Sands reported worse than expected first-quarter results recently. Tourism growth in Macao also slowed from 40 per cent last year to 19 per cent in the first three months of 2005.Andes Cheng, analyst at Hong Kong's South China Finance and Management, said he expected the number of casinos to rise from 15 in 2004 to 28 in 2009. Gaming tables are expected to surge from 1,092 last year to more than 4,500 by then.“The growth in tourist arrival is set to drop but the number of gaming tables is still growing very rapidly. That's why oversupply is a big concern among investors now,” Mr Cheng said.

Singapore said this week it would build two casino resorts by 2009.Macao’s gaming revenue, which jumped 44.3 per cent last year to US$5bn, is expected to overtake that of Las Vegas this year or next year following the opening of more foreign-owned casinos in the enclave. Las Vegas’s revenues rose 12.1 per cent to US$5.33bn in 2004.Macao, the only Chinese city where casino gambling is legal, ended local billionaire Stanley Ho’s 40-year casino monopoly in 2001 and awarded three licences to Mr Ho, Mr Lui’s Galaxy and Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts.Galaxy granted a sub-concession in December 2002 to the Las Vegas Sands, controlled by Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson, which unveiled a US$12bn-US$15bn project in the former Portuguese colony last month.
215;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2005-04-18T11:17:38Z;Singapore bets on casinos to lift economy;;Singapore said on Monday it would build two casino resorts, worth a combined S$5bn (US$3bn), in a controversial move to increase tourism and create jobs.The two casinos, which will be located on the recreation island of Sentosa and a new central property development Marina Bay, will be completed by 2009 and are expected to add S$1.5bn a year to the economy, the government said.The casinos would form the centrepiece of what are expected to be Singapore’s biggest entertainment, hotel and retail complexes and spearhead efforts to double the number of visitors to 17m in 10 years, reversing Singapore’s declining share of Asia’s tourism market.The casino would help create new jobs for unskilled workers as assembly-line manufacturing moves from Singapore to China, said Dominique Dwor-Frecaut, regional economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore. The “integrated resorts” are also expected to boost the ailing construction sector.The prospect of large profits has already attracted 19 of the world’s leading gaming operators to submit initial proposals to build the new resorts. The government said it would award licences for resort development by the end of this year.MGM-Mirage, Las Vegas Sands, Harrah’s Entertainment and Wynn Resorts are seen as the favourites to gain the casino licences since all four are seeking partnerships with state-owned CapitaLand and Keppel Land or other local property developers.But some analysts are sceptical that the casinos will deliver promised economic gains because of doubts they will attract many foreign gamblers.The risk is that Singapore could remain a secondary gambling destination in Asia behind Macao, which has become the centre of Asia’s gaming industry since opening to foreign operators in 2002.“Singapore’s proposed casino would by itself struggle to attract a critical mass of foreign clientele, thus undermining the economic logic of this project,” said a recent report by Morgan Stanley in Singapore.Another worry is a government proposal to charge Singaporeans a S$100 a day entry fee to the casinos to curb the growth of gambling among the local population.But this threatens to reduce significantly casino revenues since Asia’s gaming industry is “highly fragmented and casinos have to rely to a large extent on local clientele”, said Morgan Stanley.In contrast, Merrill Lynch predicted that Singapore’s casinos will attract gamblers from neighbouring countries and capture 60 per cent of the US$735m that Singaporeans spend on gambling abroad.

Their reversal of fortunes in financial health is even more striking.Leeds went for broke under Peter Ridsdale and nearly went broke. The club has spent two seasons staving off administration, with local owners led by Gerald Krasner holding the fort until a Swiss company fronted by Ken Bates took control. This week, the new regime angered supporters with huge increases in season ticket prices. The top price at Elland Road in 2005-06 will be £640, more than £200 above the best seats at Sheffield United.The contrast was underlined this week with Sheffield United's interim results. The club reduced its pre-tax loss from £1.28m to £902,000 and its net debt from £10.1m to £7.1m, helped by the £5.2m proceeds of a share issue in September.Kevin McCabe, chairman and 47 per cent shareholder, is pursuing a strategy of diversification to reduce reliance on football revenues. The club operates a complex of serviced offices for small to medium-sized businesses and is applying to build a casino next to Bramall Lane with a US partner, Las Vegas Sands.Another diversification was signalled this week with the launch of a £50m commercial property development joint venture with Scarborough Property, a company controlled by McCabe. Of course, property development was the strategy once pursued by a younger Ken Bates at Chelsea Village, and look where he is now.Clear skies aheadSunday night, weather permitting, Terrence Collis will be on his rooftop in Pimlico observing Jupiter at its best and brightest.

As it happens, his predecessor at the bank, Geraldine Davies, left Prudential earlier this year when the life assurance group did the opposite and integrated communications roles. Whatever the structure, it seems, someone always wants to change.Collis joined Lloyds TSB after a similar stint at National Westminster Bank. He is especially proud of NatWest's pioneering corporate support of the gay rights group Stonewall.But some say his finest hour came just as NatWest was being taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland.

A fitting farewell before moving to the Black Horse.Down to earthAs leaving announcements go, Flightstore Group's comment on Ian Walberg's resignation as technical director with immediate effect was oddly opaque.The company, which operates inflight internet shopping, said: ""His departure represents a continuation of the transition of Flightstore's business model to be better able to exploit the mainstream internet advertising market and other interactive channels.""Say, what? Walberg, who was also thanked for his contribution, shouldn't read anything bad into that obtuse sentence. Chief executive Andy Mitchell, appointed a year ago, simply wants to expand through acquisition of other internet-based advertising and marketing businesses. Walberg mainly dealt with the airborne operation.ConchologyShell Transport and Trading, the UK arm of the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas group, last year chose Rhysota (below left) as the shell to feature on the cover of its annual report. Its elegant transparency was perhaps intended to signal the company's new openness after the reserves debacle.Unfortunately, as we noted at the time, the image also resembled liquid going down a plughole. The previous year, the cover shell was an abalone, whose shiny mother-of-pearl surface was riddled with holes. How prescient that proved to be.Royal Dutch/Shell's 20-F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission this week was adorned with Conus marmoreus (below right). One such marble cone was etched by Rembrandt in 1650. It feeds on molluscs, including other cones. And so the message this time is?mudlark@ft.com"
218;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2005-03-08T23:17:36Z;Wall St slides after TI narrows guidance;;Wall Street stocks slid on Tuesday after a disappointing earnings update from Texas Instruments put pressure on semiconductor shares.By the closing bell, the Nasdaq Composite had lost 0.8 per cent to 2,073.55. The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 per cent to 1,219.40 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 10,912.62.The slide, which followed a mixed performance in the previous session, cast a further pall over a burgeoning rally that had appeared to be gathering strength late last week amid a fall-off in oil prices and an upbeat jobs report.The prospect of a slowdown in earnings and concerns about the sustainability of the US trade deficit have kept stock market gains in check this year, disappointing market watchers who had been hoping the sharp rally that closed out 2004 would continue through early 2005.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the market’s lacklustre performance was surprising given recent upward revisions to estimates for key economic indicators such as gross domestic product growth and business capital spending. “The fundamental things that drive performance have improved,” he said. “At some point you are going to see this market doing better as people recognise that the business conditions are better than expected.”Narrowed earnings guidance from Texas Instruments, the computer chip maker, provided much of the downward momentum. TI shares fell 3.8 per cent to $26.34. Other chipmakers also suffered. Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip maker, slipped 1.2 per cent to $24.80. Qualcomm, TI’s chief rival, gave back 2.9 per cent to $36.29 following Monday’s 5 per cent rise. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which tracks a basket of chip stocks, drifted 1.4 per cent lower to 435.44.McDonalds led shares in food groups lower. The fast food chain fell 2.1 per cent to $33.48 after it reported February same-store sales up just 1.6 per cent – its worst performance since 2003. Kroger, the grocery chain, fell 4.9 per cent to $16.85 after its quarterly losses widened.Las Vegas Sands, the casino and conventions group, weighed in with its maiden set of quarterly results following its meteoric initial public offering. LVS shares, which shot up more than 60 per cent on their first day of trading in December, fell 4.9 per cent to $47.35.The mergers and acquisitions buzz continued as Circuit City, the electronics retailer, rebuffed a takeover bid from Highfields, the Boston hedge fund, sending its shares down 2.7 per cent.Johnson Controls, the maker of car interiors, rose 3.2 per cent after it raised its second quarter guidance.Energy stocks were among the leading gainers as the price of oil resumed its climb above the $54 mark. Sunoco rose 2.1 per cent to $105.25.
219;LVS;Las Vegas Sands;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
