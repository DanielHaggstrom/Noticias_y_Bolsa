It is an obvious step that allows us to strengthen a leading position that we first achieved in 2014 [with the Novartis deal].”

This is a company with good assets that can be run better.”Hologic began courting Mr MacMillan in October, several weeks before Mr Icahn turned up on the investor register through a derivatives position that gave him a 12.6 per cent stake in the company.Mr Icahn, who in recent weeks has trumpeted the value that his representatives can add to share price performance when they join corporate boards, welcomed the appointment of Mr MacMillan. “We are enthusiastic about and supportive of the appointment,” he said.“He has extensive industry experience and a record of delivering strong financial results and creating shareholder value,” he added.The two Icahn representatives joining the board are Jonathan Christodoro and Samuel Merksamer, both managing directors at Icahn Capital.The activist investor had not made specific demands over the strategic direction of the company, according to people with knowledge of his approaches to board members. Mr Icahn spoke to Mr MacMillan for the first time only on Saturday.Mr MacMillan was forced out of Stryker in February 2012 after seven years at the helm, after revealing to the board that he had a relationship with the flight attendant on the corporate jet. He was previously talked about as a rising star chief executive and a possible contender to run Johnson & Johnson.David LaVance, Hologic chairman, said: “Steve led Stryker to strong operating performance, including nearly tripling revenue, and delivered stock price appreciation that significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index.”Mr MacMillan replaces Jack Cumming, a former chief of Hologic, who had returned to run the company this year and to launch a review of its businesses.
2;HOLX;Hologic Inc;2012-04-30T18:35:10Z;Gen-Probe deal boosts Hologic;;Hologic, the US medical device company, said on Monday it would acquire Gen-Probe, which makes diagnostic tests, in a $3.75bn cash deal that will give it a stronger presence in blood screening and women’s health.Hologic is paying $82.75 a share for Gen-Probe, representing a 20 per cent premium above Gen-Probe’s closing share price last week. The deal is expected to bring $75m in cost savings in the next three years.Hologic’s acquisition comes as healthcare companies have turned increasingly acquisitive in the first half of the year. Expiring drug patents and slowing use of medical services in the US have led companies to look for new ways of lifting sales.Separately, Warner Chilcott, the Dublin-based, US-quoted speciality drug business, said it had launched a strategic review including the option of a sale to another business.Warner Chilcott said it was considering “a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, which include preliminary discussions with potential offerors”.Rob Cascella, chief executive of Hologic, said: “With the addition of this product line and these products, we feel that we’re positioned to now have a high-growth molecular business and overall diagnostic business.”Gen-Probe specialises in testing for gonorrhoea, chlamydia and human papillomavirus (HPV). Hologic expects the addition of Gen-Probe to bolster its diagnostics business, helping to grow as quickly as its core breast health business.For Gen-Probe, the combination with Hologic opens it up to emerging markets and Europe, where Hologic already has sales and marketing teams in place.“What we intend to do is leverage the products of Gen-Probe with the existing distribution that Hologic currently has, with 500 people in China today in a direct sales operation. We are direct throughout all of Europe and have an infrastructure of training, applications and support people around the world,” Mr Cascella said.Goldman Sachs is helping Hologic finance the deal and is acting, along with Perella Weinberg Partners, as a financial adviser. Morgan Stanley is advising Gen-Probe.Warner Chilcott’s shares rose amid reports that it was under scrutiny from potential buyers including Bayer of Germany.Warner Chilcott, which reported net income of $171m last year on sales of $2.6bn, specialises in US branded products for women’s healthcare, gastroenterology, dermatology and urology.
3;HOLX;Hologic Inc;2010-03-11T19:39:53Z;Philips slides amid talk of Hologic bid;;A late rumour linking Philips with a US purchase sent the Dutch conglomerate’s shares lower.The talk suggested the group, known for making items from shavers to beauty products, might seek to buy New York-based Hologic.The US company, that has a market capitalisation of $4.8bn, is a leading manufacturer of diagnostic and surgical equipment, including breast cancer treatment and cervical cancer screening. Philips closed 1 per cent lower at €23.76.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.3 per cent to 1,055.82.France’s Lagardère, the world’s largest publisher of consumer magazines, suffered the steepest fall on the FTSE Eurofirst index on Thursday after it disappointed investors with poor earnings for 2009 and a weak outlook for the year ahead. The publisher of Elle magazine and the popular Twilight series of vampire-themed novels, struggled to maintain advertising income as marketing budgets tightened in the economic downturn.Several brokers, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, cut their price targets on the stock, sending the company’s shares down 7.3 per cent to €26.39.Germany’s GEA Group, whose machines milk a third of the world’s dairy cows, jumped after it posted a 60 per cent rise in full-year net income to €161.7m.The group’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings and higher order estimates for this year sent its shares to a two-month high, up 7.9 per cent to €16.40.Geberit fell 3.5 per cent to SFr188 after the the Swiss maker of toilet-flushing systems announced an 11.2 per cent decline in sales last year.Andre Kukhnin at Credit Suisse said: “The management issued cautious guidance for the construction market. It said it expected declines in construction volumes in most of Geberit’s important markets in 2010, in particular new build and non-residential, with no recovery expected until 2011.”Volkswagen shares rallied after the German carmaker said it would use a convertible bond issue alongside a share sale to help fund planned acquisitions. The company aims to overtake Toyota as the world’s largest carmaker by 2018.The company also said two-month sales at its seven car brands and its van division surged 27 per cent, helped by growing emerging market demand. Volkswagen rose 4.4 per cent to €73.39, leading gains in the sector.BMW, the world’s biggest luxury carmaker, added 1.3 per cent to €32.69, after the company said it would rely more on its new models to boost 2010 sales than on a significant improvement in the luxury car sector.The German carmaker said it expected models such as the new 5-series to drive an increase in sales in Germany, Brazil, China, India and the United States.Panalpina, the Swiss logistics group, advanced after the company said it expected air and ocean freight markets to recover in 2010, but warned of poor visibility after it swung to a net fourth-quarter loss. Its shares added 3.2 per cent to SFr80.80.The Finnish chemicals company Kemira fell 5.2 per cent to €12.04 after its paints unit, Tikkurila, said market conditions remained challenging. Tikkurila, which is due to list this month, said it expected 2010 net sales and underlying operating profit to be flat compared with 2009.Swatch Group added 0.8 per cent to SFr327.50 after the Swiss watchmaker’s chief executive said the company had seen extraordinary growth in January and February.

Jack Cumming, Hologic’s chairman and chief executive officer, will be chief executive. Both companies are based in Boston and will maintain their current offices.Hologic, which develops and manufactures diagnostic and imaging systems, reported a record $181.1m in revenue in its fiscal second quarter and earned $21.6m. Among its leading products is the Selenia full-field digital mamography system.Cytyc makes ThinPrep, which the company says is the most widely used method for cervical cancer screening in the US. It also makes products that treat excessive menstrual bleeding and allow physicians to deliver radiation therapy from inside the breast following removal of a tumour.Cytyc said it generated a record $168.9m in revenue in the first quarter and earned $38.3m, excluding charges associated with two acquisitions.Under the terms of the deal, Cytyc shareholders will receive 0.52 shares of Hologic stock, and $16.50 in cash for each Cytyc share, for about $6.2bn based on the companies’ closing stock prices on Friday. The amount represents a 33 per cent premium to Cytyc’s closing price on Friday.Goldman Sachs and law firm Brown Rudnick advised Hologic. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase along with law firm Hogan & Hartson advised Cytyc. Jeffries & Co is providing a fairness opinion to Hologic.The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year and add 10 cents per share to Hologic’s earnings in the first year following the transaction. The companies said that they expected $25m to $30m in annual cost savings.They will have a combined sales force of 1,200 – 900 in the US – dedicated to calling on 30,000 obstetricians and gynaecologists; 10,000 hospitals and imaging clinics; 2,500 breast surgeons, 40,000 radiologists and 4,000 radiation oncologists."
5;HOLX;Hologic Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
