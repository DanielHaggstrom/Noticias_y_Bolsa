0;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2020-01-24T21:47:09Z;Shares in US credit card companies plunge as expenses rise;Discover and Synchrony also hit by impact of new accounting rule;Shares in two US credit card companies plunged on Friday as rising expenses and the impact of a new accounting rule dragged down their outlooks for 2020.Discover Financial fell more than 11 per cent after it reported fourth-quarter results broadly in line with Wall Street’s expectations, with revenue and net income growth of 5 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively. However, the company said it expects operating expenses to rise as much as 10 per cent, driven by increased marketing expenses.The company also forecast that the current expected credit losses, or CECL, rule — an accounting standard that came into effect this month — would increase loan loss reserves by $2.5bn, more than it previously expected. The rule requires lenders to recognise probable loan losses earlier, though the initial impact on reserves does not hit reported profit.Shares in Synchrony Financial, the General Electric spin-off specialising in private-label credit cards for merchants, ended the day almost 10 per cent lower as investors took issue with guidance, despite a solid fourth-quarter result.Net income of $731m met analyst expectations, but the company said 2020 margins would be adversely affected by the sale of the Walmart card loan portfolio and investments in new technology. It forecast an initial reserve impact of $3bn from CECL.Shares in both Discover and Synchrony fell despite broadly stable credit-quality indicators and positive comments about the economic outlook.“For both companies . . . [investors’] real sensitivity has been around, one, the impact of CECL and, two, expenses above expectations,” said analyst John Hecht of Jefferies.Investors responded more favourably to results at American Express, which has a wealthier customer base.Fourth-quarter revenue at Amex rose 9 per cent from the year before, to $11.4bn. Net income and earnings per share, adjusting for a tax benefit in 2018, rose 12 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively.Amex’s strongest growth was in card fees, which rose 20 per cent to $1bn in the quarter. The fees are paid primarily by users of premium cards that provide air miles and other rewards. The company forecast revenue growth of 8-10 per cent in 2020.“We expect card fee revenues will remain the fastest-growing revenue line in 2020,” said Jeff Cambell, Amex’s chief financial officer. American Express said its reserve adjustment for CECL would be $1.7bn.Amex shares closed up 2.9 per cent on Friday.“All three [card companies] are investing for growth, but this affected Discover and Synchrony more, with the CECL impact,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, card analyst at KBW.

Amex said spending by its card members was up 8 per cent from the second quarter of 2018, an acceleration from the year on year growth of 7 per cent in the first-quarter.Amex is the second-largest card issuer by purchase volume, according to the Nilson Report, after JPMorgan, which reported an acceleration in spending growth from 10 per cent in the first quarter to 11 per cent in the second.Of the major issuers that have reported results in the past week — a group that also includes Citigroup and Bank of America — all reported faster spending growth in the second quarter than in the first.Jennifer Piepszak, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, was asked about the growth in card spending volume on the bank’s earnings call. “I would say that [the business is] firing on all cylinders. So [are] its brand, its people, its products. It does certainly help to have the backdrop of a healthy US consumer as well and, in fact, retail sales this morning looked strong. So we can expect that to continue,” she said.Retail sales figures in the US have been mixed this year, though they showed a fourth consecutive month of growth in June. Expanded use of credit cards could reflect consumer confidence or signal that consumers are having to borrow money to maintain spending levels.The amount of debt that Americans are holding or “revolving” in their credit card accounts has picked up in recent months, as well. Total revolving consumer debt rose 8 per cent in April and May from the year before, hitting $1.07tn, according to the Federal Reserve. That is in contrast to the first quarter, when the growth in revolving balances rose only 1.5 per cent.The last two months aside, the recent trend has been moderate growth in revolving balances, argued Brian Riley of Mercator Advisory. “The US consumer is fine — that’s the backdrop.” Mr Riley said. “The fact that spending is up and is not being pushed into revolving [balances] is a healthy sign.”The number of accounts overdue by more than 30 days rose slightly in the second quarter at both Amex and Capital One.But Richard Fairbank, chief executive at Capital One, noted that growth in card purchase volume had outstripped the rise in card loans in the second quarter.
2;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2019-01-23T18:34:22Z;End to Walmart dispute puts Synchrony on track for best day ever;;Synchrony Financial was heading toward its best day ever on Wall Street after extending a credit card deal with Sam’s Club and announcing that Walmart dropped a lawsuit against the bank.Walmart announced in July it had selected Capital One Financial as its new credit card partner, ending an exclusive deal with Synchrony that dated back nearly 20 years. Walmart later filed a lawsuit in November accusing Synchrony of breaching its agreement with the retailer. Synchrony had called the complaint “baseless.”Synchrony said Wednesday that Walmart agreed to dismiss the lawsuit, which had sought $800m in damages.The bank also reached separate agreements to sell its existing Walmart loan portfolio to Capital One and extend its deal to service credit cards for members of Sam’s Club, the Walmart-owned warehouse chain.“We are very pleased to have reached these agreements. Obtaining certainty around the Walmart portfolio and a renewal on Sam’s Club is a great outcome for the company,” Synchrony chief executive Margaret Keane said in a statement.The company also renewed a credit-card partnership with Amazon and extended and expanded its relationship with Qurate Retail Group, the parent company of HSN and QVC. The news coincided with Synchrony’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which showed a higher profit that beat Wall Street’s forecast.Shares leapt 10.4 per cent to $29.29 in recent trading, setting a pace to record the stock’s largest one-day gain since going public in 2014.The bank, a former unit of GE Capital, issues private-label credit cards for retailers including JCPenney, Gap and Lowe’s. Walmart had accounted for more than one-tenth of Synchrony’s total interest and fees on loans in 2017.Synchrony said it expects to transfer the $9bn in Walmart card balances to Capital One late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter.Capital One shares were down more than 5 per cent after reporting weaker fourth-quarter earnings than expected. During a conference call with analysts, chief executive Richard Fairbank said the portfolio has “high credit loss” but Capital One’s share of credit losses is “fixed at a low percentage throughout the partnership.”
3;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2018-07-12T18:19:05Z;Synchrony shares cut up as Walmart reportedly mulls credit card switch;;Shares in credit card company Synchrony Financial are getting shredded on Thursday after a report that Walmart is considering moving its branded credit card business to Capital One Financial.The stock fell 4 per cent to $33.20. If the drop holds, that would be its worst day in four months.Synchrony is a provider of Walmart’s store credit cards. According to Bloomberg, more than 10 per cent of the interest and fees Synchrony earned on its loans last year came from the retail giant.The arrangement is up for renegotiation between now and next year, and the report said Walmart is mulling a proposal from Capital One alongside one from Synchrony.
4;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2018-01-19T14:42:10Z;Synchrony Financial reports solid revenue growth;Impact from tax changes weighs on bottom line.;Credit card company Synchrony Financial enjoyed solid growth in revenue during the December quarter, but bottom line profit has taken a knock owing to the impact from recent tax cuts.The financial services company, which was a subsidiary of GE Capital till it was spun off and floated in 2014, reported an revenue during the three months ended December 31 of $3.9bn. Although that was 8 per cent higher than a year earlier, it was about 1 per cent less than the mean analyst forecast in a ThomsonReuters poll.Net income for the most recent quarter was $385m, weighed down by an additional tax expense of $160m related to changes in the US Tax Act, compared to $576m a year ago. Excluding the tax hit, income would have come in above analyst estimates.On credit quality, Synchrony noted that loans 30 days or more past their due date had increased to 4.67 per cent of total period-end loan receivables compared to 4.32 per cent at the same time last year. The company’s allowance for loan losses as a proportion of its receivables portfolio rose about 1.1 percentage points to 6.8 per cent ove the past year.Synchrony pointed to higher loyalty programme expenses as a reason for a drop in other income, echoing sector peer American Express, which yesterday reported a 12.3 per cent rise in the cost of paying out rewards to card members.Last August, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed it had taken a stake in Synchrony, which now sits on 2.66 per cent of the company’s issued capital. Berkshire also holds stakes rival card companies in American Express and Visa.Shares in Synchrony, up 4 per cent so far this year, edged 0.2 per cent higher at $37.37.
5;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2017-08-14T22:13:01Z;Berkshire ramps up bets on credit cards with Synchrony stake;;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has ramped up its bet on the consumer finance sector with a new position in credit card company Synchrony Financial during the second quarter.In a regulatory filing detailing its US-listed stock holdings, Berkshire said it owned 17.46m shares in Synchrony as of June 30. The shares – the equivalent of a 2.2 per cent stake – are worth about $520.7m.Synchrony shares, down more than 18 per cent so far this year, jumped 4.5 per cent in after market trading.The Oracle of Omaha’s financial moves are closely followed by Wall Street. The foray into Synchrony could provide a much needed fillip to the credit card industry, which has been reporting rising write-downs as some Americans struggle to pay off their debts.Berkshire is already the biggest shareholder in American Express, with about a 17 per cent stake. Synchrony, a spin-off from General Electric, provides cards for retailers including Walmart, Amazon and Gap.Ironically, the June quarter also saw Berkshire exit the remainder of its 0.1 per cent – or 10.6m share – stake in GE.
6;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2017-04-30T13:04:44Z;US credit card stocks sink to fresh lows;Providers earmark $1bn more for bad loans as clients struggle to pay off debts;Investor concerns are mounting over the amount of debt Americans are accumulating on credit cards as banks and other issuers caution that more customers are struggling to pay off their balances.US credit card stocks have hit new lows for the year after figures in recent days from three of the biggest providers — Synchrony, Capital One and Discover — showed they set aside 36 per cent, or $1bn, more for bad loans in the first quarter than a year ago.Weaker than forecast financial results on Friday from Synchrony Financial, a $90bn-in-assets issuer that provides cards for retailers including Walmart and Amazon, pushed its shares down 16 per cent and sent a chill through the wider sector.Just three months after the company forecast that net charge-off — or writedown — rates would come in at no more than 5 per cent this year, Synchrony said it now expected they would in fact be at least that high.It was the latest disappointment for investors in Synchrony, a spin-off from General Electric. The company warned last June that write-off rates were running higher than forecast.Several US banks have also disclosed deteriorating credit card metrics. JPMorgan Chase declared in the first quarter that $990m worth of loans were unlikely to be collected, a fifth more than a year ago.Executives said rising losses were to be expected given the businesses had been expanding and default rates had been historically low.Marianne Lake, chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase, told analysts that losses were still running at “very, very low levels”. Margaret Keane, Synchrony’s chief executive, insisted the company was still operating in a “fairly good macro environment”, citing lower unemployment.However, analysts said the earnings season made clear that a boom in consumer credit quality had come to an end, and some were concerned that issuers were continuing to expand despite the rising levels of soured loans.Lenders have been piling into credit cards, attracted by the prospect of heftier returns than other types of banking.Issuers have been wooing customers with generous reward schemes but typically charge interest rates of between 13 and 20 per cent to those who fail to pay off balances. Some have been signing up riskier customers with lower credit ratings, for whom interest rates are even higher.US credit card users had racked up $1tn in debts by the end of last year, according to The Nilson Report.Kenneth Bruce, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: “There’s been a lot of growth across consumer credit for a lot of companies. We haven’t seen anybody really pull back.”Richard Fairbank, chief executive of Capital One, indicated the group was easing off on the lending accelerator as its first-quarter results showed that net charge-offs rose 28 per cent from last year to $1.51bn.“We have been tightening our underwriting,” he told analysts. “We still see growth opportunities in our domestic card business, but our growth window is gradually getting smaller.”Synchrony and Capital One are the two worst performing of the 65 biggest US financial stocks so far this year.They and Discover are considered a good guide to the health of low- and middle-income consumers given the scale of their mass market operations.
7;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2016-11-10T23:41:10Z;US consumer credit: loan survivors;A sector that has not dealt with recession or inflation in years;On the fringes of a prospering US economy, perhaps things may not be so rosy. One indication: Donald Trump’s surprise election victory on Tuesday night.But another one may be the prospects for listed consumer lenders — OneMain Holdings, Santander Consumer, Synchrony Financial, Lending Club — whose share prices are down so far this year.On election day, OneMain, the leading outfit making unsecured personal loans via branches, saw its shares crash 40 per cent after a poor 2017 forecast.There is little sign of a recession, but it will not take much of a downdraft to sting those companies that have exploited the economic and credit expansion of recent years.Overall, household debt remains below its 2008 peak. But that belies an explosion of credit card borrowing, student loans, and ordinary consumer debt. Returns on equity for the institutions that advance these loans can approach 20 per cent.However, profitability hinges on managing bad debt while still growing overall balances. OneMain tumbled because it said delinquencies would rise in 2017 as it integrates a substantial acquisition.Similarly, internet-based Lending Club nudged up the rates it charges riskier borrowers in response to heightened losses. Such worries have also plagued subprime motor lender Santander Consumer.The listed lenders all make the same noises about high underwriting standards and avoiding the worst credit risks.But supply is growing: OneMain’s chief noted that the availability of unsecured credit is “the greatest it has been in recent years”, citing credit card companies. At the same time, Goldman Sachs has just entered the consumer loan game with its Marcus product.The sector has rallied since Tuesday, on hopes that higher long-term interest rates will boost profits, and that regulatory oversight might be looser in future.The prospect of impending fiscal stimulus has excited equity investors, too. But this is an economy that has not sniffed inflation or a recession in years, either.What appears on the fringes can encroach much faster than imagined. Just look at Mr Trump.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
8;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2016-07-31T17:08:42Z;US $18bn credit card debt spree sparks fears;Concerns that too much risk is being taken on in slowing economy;US banks have ramped up lending to consumers through credit cards and overdrafts at the fastest pace since 2007, triggering concerns that they are taking on too much risk in a slowing economy.The industry has piled on about $18bn of card loans and other types of revolving credit within just three months, as consumers borrow more and banks battle for customers with air miles, cashback deals and other offers.The surge in lending has come as economists expect the US election to create sufficient uncertainty to impede growth for the rest of the year, increasing the stakes for lenders at a time when the credit cycle appears to have passed a peak.Recently disclosed second-quarter results showed that credit card loans increased 10 per cent year-on-year at Wells Fargo, 12 per cent at Citigroup and 16 per cent at US Bank, according to Deutsche Bank research. Expansion was an especially aggressive 26 per cent at SunTrust, the $200bn Atlanta-based lender.Across the US banking industry, credit card and other revolving loans rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.6 per cent in the second quarter to $685bn, according to Federal Reserve data.The credit card business remains among the most profitable in banking. Lenders can charge much higher interest rates — the US average is between 12 and 14 per cent — than for other types of credit, and borrower delinquencies are still low by historical standards.However, there are some early indications that the cycle is beginning to turn.“In the present environment it’s probably a safe strategy, but as we saw with housing in 07/08 that environment can change very rapidly,” said Nancy Bush, banking analyst at Georgia-based NAB Research. “They need to be very careful.”Bob Hammer, the veteran credit-card consultant, said: “Times are pretty good right now, but it’s questionable how long it’s going to last”.Synchrony Financial, the largest supplier of store-branded cards in the US, sent a shudder through the sector in June when it increased its forecast for credit losses.Several banks have since disclosed that they have boosted reserves for losses, although executives said this largely reflected expansion of their businesses rather than a deterioration in credit quality.Capital One added $375m to its loan loss reserve for its domestic card business, according to Barclays, while JPMorgan Chase added a $250m loss allowance for its credit-card portfolio.The largest US bank by assets has expanded in the past two or three years into what Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer, described as the “near prime space” — in essence, customers with lower credit scores.Executives say that the lending push is justified as the consumers they target are in good financial shape, pointing to rising house prices and low unemployment.“We’re growing our direct consumer lending portfolio at a very rapid pace,” said William Rogers, chairman and chief executive of SunTrust. “That is indeed helping to mitigate the effect of [pressure on profit margins] overall.”

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

The Nasdaq Composite added 1.6 per cent to 4,956.8.Payrolls in the US grew by 287,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said — over 100,000 more than had been forecast by analysts.But traders were reluctant to call the jobs report a sign of renewed expectations for rate rises.“I don’t know if it improves expectations but it doesn’t lower expectations,” Mr Kinahan said, adding that the focus would be on upcoming data releases for clues as to the trajectory of moves by the Federal Reserve.In the meantime, shares of retailer Gap rallied sharply after the company behind Old Navy, Banana Republic and its eponymous brand reported same-store sales in June that topped expectations.The San Francisco-based company said like-for-like sales rose 2 per cent last month, driven by strength at Old Navy. Gap shares rose 5 per cent to $22.72.Shares of Synchrony Financial, the former store credit business of General Electric spun off in 2014, jumped on news that its board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents a share and a share repurchase programme of up to $952m for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. The stock gained 5 per cent to $27.31.“We believe [Synchrony’s] capital plan is likely to be received positively given it is slightly better than some of the Street assumptions,” Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at KBW, said in a note.Alcoa was also a strong gainer, up 5.1 per cent to $9.82 ahead of its earnings report set for Monday.The energy sector made gains of 1.3 per cent after coming under pressure on Thursday as US oil prices fell below $45 a barrel to a two-month low after a weekly report showed a much smaller than expected decline in stockpiles. US oil prices were back up above $45 on Friday.
11;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2016-06-14T20:30:50Z;Equity holdings cut to four-year lows;Vix ‘fear gauge’ jumps on fourth day of US stock declines;Investors have cut their equity holdings to four-year lows as uncertainty in global financial markets rises ahead of the UK’s referendum on its EU membership and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision.Bogged down by these and other concerns, they have allocated the biggest slice of their portfolio to cash since November 2001, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s global fund manager survey, which surveyed 174 participants with $543bn in assets under managementInvestors were just net 1 per cent overweight equities, down from 6 per cent last month.But they have increased their cash positions to the highest level in nearly 15 years, at 5.7 per cent, from 5.5 per cent in May.The defensive positioning comes as polls show strengthening support for the Leave camp. However, the BofA survey showed that while investors thought a British exit, or Brexit, would be the biggest tail risk for the world economy, two-thirds thought that result “unlikely” or “not at all likely”.“Quantitative failure”, or the diminishing power of central bank bond-buying to stimulate growth, and the risk of a Chinese devaluation or default were the second- and third-largest tail risks.Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, the Vix, a barometer of expected volatility on the S&P 500 index over the next 30 days, has jumped 44 per cent this month.“The volatility spike we have seen is just remarkable,” said Randy Frederick at Charles Schwab. “This move is one you would expect to see when the S&P drops 200 points versus the 30 we’ve seen in the last few days,” he added.On Tuesday the Vix was up 2.2 per cent amid a fourth straight day of declines in the US stock market.By the close the S&P 500 had declined 0.2 per cent to 2,075.3 — its longest losing streak since February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 17,674.8, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent lower at 4,843.6.Shares of Synchrony Financial had their sharpest daily decline since the consumer finance company went public in 2014 after it warned that loan write-offs could climb over the next year.“While the loss rate in our portfolio is at historically low levels, we very recently finished our loss forecast, and we are now expecting a 20-30 basis point increase in our net charge-off rates as we look out over the next 12 months,” Synchrony said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Synchrony, which was spun off from General Electric, said it would increase its reserves for loan losses, or set-asides for future liabilities, beginning in the current quarter. The shares slid 13.1 per cent to $26.45.Other credit card issuers faced selling pressure. American Express fell 4.1 per cent to $61.07 while Discover Financial dropped 4.1 per cent to $53.27.
12;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2016-06-14T17:33:27Z;US credit card stocks hit by warning on loan repayments;Synchrony Financial says it expects write-off rates to climb;Synchrony Financial sent a shiver through US credit card stocks on Tuesday by warning that some consumers were struggling to repay loans, just a couple of months after saying that investors should have no cause for concern.The company, spun out of General Electric in July 2014, said it expected write-off rates to climb 20 to 30 basis points over the next 12 months, and would increase its reserves for bad loans beginning this quarter.In April, as it presented first-quarter results, the company had guided that net charge-off rates would be consistent with the very low levels of the past couple of years.Shares in the company, which is the largest supplier of private-label credit cards in the US, fell more than 13 per cent in New York, their biggest daily fall on record, and dragging down peers such as American Express, Capital One and Ally Financial.The warning also knocked bigger banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which have been vocal in recent months about their plans to build their credit-card units.Mark Palmer, an analyst at BTIG, noted that the announcement came in the wake of weak sales figures from big department stores, suggesting that the US consumer was not quite as healthy as previously thought.“Normalisation” in loss rates “should have been expected”, he said, “given the late stage in the credit cycle”.Credit card units have been a rare bright spot for the big US banks in recent quarters, as trading businesses have struggled for momentum and as losses from loose lending in the oil patch have begun to show up in corporate loan books.At Chase, for example, net charge-off rates held steady at 2.62 per cent over the year to the end of March, even as the number of active cards jumped by half a million to 33m. Over the long run, loss rates tend to range between 3 and 4 per cent for bank issuers, and about 5 per cent for private-label issuers.But the announcement from Synchrony suggests that the cycle for cards has begun to turn. The company, which sprung out of GE’s domestic appliances business, issues white-label credit cards for a group of national and regional retailers including Walmart, Lowe’s, Gap and Dick’s Sporting Goods.Remember that movie, Airplane, when it was the wrong week to quit sniffing glue? This was the wrong week to change credit guidelines. It’s fuelling the fire of concerns in a very difficult marketMore than a quarter of Synchrony’s loan receivables have scores of 660 or below on the commonly used FICO scale, which is typically regarded as subprime.Brian Doubles, Synchrony’s chief financial officer, said on Tuesday that the company was not seeing a “step change” in loss rates, and noted that it was still “operating at very close to historic lows for the business”.However, he added that consumers’ ability to “cure themselves” when they start to struggle with late payments has been “challenged”. “It’s been challenged all year and we’ve seen just in the most recent data a little bit of the deterioration there.”John Hecht, analyst at Jefferies, said that Tuesday’s share-price reactions were amplified by general jitters over Brexit.“Remember that movie, Airplane, when it was the wrong week to quit sniffing glue? This was the wrong week to change credit guidelines. It’s fuelling the fire of concerns in a very difficult market.”

Buybacks need not, however, involve hard cash outlays, as General Electric has just shown.Last year it listed a 15 per cent stake in its credit card unit, Synchrony Financial. It could have sold or spun off the remainder of the unit. Instead it chose a rare “split-off”, offering to exchange its Synchrony shares for GE shares (at an attractive exchange ratio of $107 of the former for every $100 of the latter). The exchange was completed last week, resulting in GE repurchasing 7 per cent, or $20bn, of its own shares at a cash cost of $0.Of course by trading away its interest in Synchrony, GE lost that unit’s earnings. Analysts at William Blair estimate that the net effect of the lost profits and the reduced share count will be a 12 cent reduction in earnings per share in 2016, less than a tenth of the expected total. Soon after the Synchrony move, the group unveiled plans to shed $200bn of assets from GE Capital, with the aim of returning the company to its industrial heritage. These divestments mean GE’s old 2015 earnings target will not be hit for another three years.Investors do not seem to mind the short-term dislocation. GE shares, after disappointing for years, have rocketed nearly 30 per cent this year. Acclaimed investor Nelson Peltz’s endorsement of GE head honcho Jeff Immelt’s business strategy looks canny. The industrial businesses — equipment for aerospace, oil and gas, and healthcare — hit a surprisingly high 4 per cent organic growth rate in the third quarter.The ways to pay shareholders without using cash are limited. Even excluding the Synchrony exchange, GE says it could spend $70bn of cash between 2015 and 2018 on dividends and repurchasing shares. That even GE, in this vein of form, can find no more attractive use of the money is a dreary comment on the world economy. The cynics have a point.This article has been amended to clarify that the Synchrony spin-off was announced before the plan to shed $200bn of GE Capital assetsEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.com

15;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2015-10-16T17:07:08Z;GE could pursue some of activist’s plans;Group open to Trian buyback idea as shift from finance causes reported earnings to drop by a third;General Electric is open to the idea of borrowing money to buy back more of its shares, its chief financial officer has said, suggesting it could pursue a proposal backed by Trian, the activist investment fund led by Nelson Peltz that last week revealed a 1 per cent stake in the company.Jeff Bornstein, GE’s chief financial officer, told the Financial Times there was little difference between GE’s strategy and the proposals set out in an 81-page presentation by Trian.For example, he said, it was possible that GE could raise its borrowings to repurchase more shares, as Trian has recommended.The company has already promised to buy back $35bn in shares by 2018, using proceeds from the sale of most of GE Capital, the financial services division, but Mr Bornstein suggested it could go further.“If our stock is undervalued, there is a good possibility we would invest that way,” he said.Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, raised the idea of borrowing an additional $20bn at the Electronic Products Group conference in May, and Trian has recommended that the company go ahead with that plan.Any such move would have to wait until after GE has lost its designation as a systemically important financial institution (Sifi), thanks to the sales from GE Capital, which two years ago generated almost half of group profits.GE plans to apply to the US Federal Reserve for de-designation in the first quarter of next year, and hopes to have formal approval by the end of 2016.Mr Bornstein also said GE’s leadership agreed with Trian’s call to be disciplined about acquisitions, and would have to see “something that’s incredibly value creating” — and more attractive than buying GE’s own shares — before doing a deal.He was speaking as GE’s historic shift away from financial services caused its reported earnings for the third quarter to drop by 29 per cent, but the company said its profits from continuing operations were still rising.The costs of implementing the divestment plan drove net earnings down to $2.51bn for the quarter, from $3.54bn a year earlier. Reported earnings per share were also down 29 per cent at 25 cents.However underlying earnings per share from continuing operations were above analysts’s expectations, and shares in the company rose 2.6 per cent by 1pm in New York trading at $28.76.Mr Immelt said GE was transforming its portfolio “at an unprecedented pace”, and was positioned to grow faster than competitors.He added that the company had performed well “in a volatile environment”, and was on course to return about $30bn to shareholders this year through dividends and the spin-off of Synchrony Financial, the North American retail credit business.The group gave further details of its plan to offload its stake of about 80 per cent in Synchrony through a share swap. Investors will be given the opportunity to hand over GE shares in return for shares in Synchrony, reducing the number of shares in issue. Full details will be released next week, but GE estimated on Friday that the exchange would lead to it taking in approximately 6-7 per cent of its shares, in effect returning $18bn-$20bn to shareholders. The offer is expected to close in the week of November 16.Trian last week revealed that it had taken a 1 per cent stake in GE and urged the company to go further than its existing plans, by adding to its borrowings and buying back more shares.Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, last week changed the outlook for GE to negative, saying that Trian’s move meant the company “could adopt a less conservative financial policy than we currently incorporate into our ratings”.Since its plan to divest the majority of its financial services businesses was revealed in April, GE has made faster progress than expected in agreeing deals for parts of its sprawling GE Capital division.The ending net investment — a measure of assets — at GE Capital dropped from about $365bn at the end of September 2014, excluding liquidity, to about $176bn a year later. As a result, operating earnings from GE Capital dropped from $843m in the third quarter of 2014 to $734m.The costs of the sale programme swung earnings from discontinued operations from a $706m profit in the third quarter of 2014 to a $347m loss in this year’s equivalent period.GE’s industrial operations saw mixed results with in aggregate a 1 per cent drop in revenues and a 1 per cent increase in profits thanks to a continued improvement in margins.The oil and gas services and equipment business, built up through acquisitions in recent years, held up despite the sharp downturn in the industry. Profits were down 12 per cent from a year ago at $584m, but GE said that was entirely because of currency effects and disposals.The biggest contributions to earnings growth came from aviation.Overall, earnings from continuing operations, including financial services activities that are directly related to GE’s manufacturing and services operations, were up 1 per cent at $2.85bn.Those businesses’ operating earnings, which exclude certain items including pensions costs, were up 14 per cent at $2.92bn.One less encouraging sign for the industrial business was that its order intake dropped 26 per cent to $23.2bn for the third quarter. Mr Bornstein added that some of the weakness in orders was due to the timing of a few sales slipping, and he expected fourth quarter orders to look “much better”.Mr Immelt added that a $199bn backlog of services business “positions the company well for any cycle.”
16;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2015-04-12T14:39:09Z;GE Capital succumbs to changing regulatory climate;Executives accepted that the financial arm was worth more detached from its parent;The dismembering of GE Capital, the sprawling financial arm of General Electric, marks the next stage in a great reordering of US finance, heavily influenced by the US government.At first blush, it seems like strong deal markets drove Friday’s dramatic announcement that GE — America’s best-known conglomerate — would sell down GE Capital’s assets from $363bn to about $90bn, and return to its industrial roots.Executives were keen to emphasise that they had been confronted with increasing evidence that GE Capital was worth more detached from its parent.First, the spin-off of Synchrony Financial, a private-label credit card business and consumer finance company. GE floated it last year at more than $19bn and it is now trading with a market value of $25bn.Second, GE managed to sell an Australian consumer finance business to a KKR-led consortium for A$8.2bn last year, about twice book value.Third, GE received a flurry of confidential enquiries, mainly from private equity groups, about its remaining businesses, which include a middle-market lending platform. “People came and offered valuations that we thought, ‘That’s different’,” said one person familiar with the situation.But the regulatory climate was always a factor. GE Capital has been earmarked for special supervision ever since it was bailed out during the financial crisis with $130bn of government loan guarantees.To reduce the risk of future bailouts, Congress in 2010 gave regulators responsibility for selecting non-bank financial groups — “systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)” — for tougher supervision.There had been debate over whether designation would be a “badge of honour” or a “scarlet letter” but the latter camp seems to have been correct. MetLife, the largest US insurer, is suing the government to try to escape its designation. Now GE Capital is planning to apply next year for “de-designation” after accomplishing more of the planned disposals.Even if all goes to plan, GE Capital will have to endure a brief period of strict oversight and the company has embarked on a massive recruitment drive to hire risk managers and financial modelling experts to help it prepare for annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve.People close to the matter said GE Capital had the most contentious relationship with regulators out of the four non-banks designated as SIFIs.In February, about the same time that he began drawing up a plan to dispose of most of his division, Keith Sherin, chief executive of GE Capital, wrote to the Fed to complain about the proposed oversight.In a 57-page letter, he said that “critical aspects” of the Fed’s plan “fail to satisfy . . . basic tests” to tailor supervision differently to that of banks. He argued the Fed was considering imposing capital requirements that were so stringent that they were “out of proportion” and would place GE Capital at “an unjustified competitive disadvantage”.The truth is that GE Capital was already at a competitive disadvantage, squeezed between banks which can borrow much more cheaply by paying depositors almost nothing for their funds, and more agile non-banks which have no limits on their leverage.Its performance has suffered. In 2008, looking — somewhat prematurely — to its post-crisis future, GE realised the world had changed but underestimated the magnitude. It estimated returns on equity would be down from 20 per cent to 15 to 20 per cent.In fact, the returns have been much worse. In 2014, return on equity was 8.6 per cent and would have been significantly worse without Synchrony. That is below GE’s cost of capital and a brake on the better performance of the industrial side of the company.Those returns are already hampered by regulatory capital requirements, which restrict the amount of debt the company uses, and could be worsened further if the Fed applies an even tougher regime that Mr Sherin railed against in his letter.Banks that buy some of GE Capital’s assets would also face the same problem of making good returns, although some might have the scale to do so.But buyers are expected to come predominantly from a pool of private equity groups that have invested heavily in growing their credit arms in recent years. Apollo, Ares, Fortress, Blackstone, GSO are already in the minds — some have already been on the phones — of GE and its advisers at Centerview and JPMorgan.The rise of those firms poses more questions about whether the focus of regulators on banks and a tiny handful of large non-banks, such as GE Capital, is distorting competition and whether it is making the overall system any safer.“The process was supposed to reduce risk in the system. This has to be the biggest question: are we reducing risk in the system or are we simply reducing risk in individual institutions?” says Mark Calabria, a former Senate banking committee aide now at the Cato Institute.Aaron Klein, a former Treasury official who is now a director at the Bipartisan Policy Center, asks: “Is financial risk like the law of thermodynamics? It can never be destroyed, it just moves around.”Additional reporting by James Fontanella in New YorkGE retreats from UK financial marketGeneral Electric is pulling out of the UK financial market, where it operates under the GE Money brand, in a move that will put billions of pounds of mortgage assets up for sale, writes Emma Dunkley.The US group revealed plans on Friday to shrink its global finance arm in order to return to its manufacturing roots. That move includes the retreat from the UK market and could lead to the sale of about £10bn of British mortgage assets.A number of specialist lenders and “challenger” banks in the UK are in talks with GE about potentially acquiring some of the assets, said people familiar with the situation.The group recently sold £250m of second mortgages to a specialist lender, but still has £10bn of primary mortgages on its balance sheet, the people said.“GE would’ve loved to have sold the UK mortgage business some time earlier, but there was no one around to buy, or the prices were unacceptable. But now, the price of the assets has gone up,” according to one source.Ray Boulger, of broker John Charcol, said: “Private equity firms have an interest in getting into higher margin parts of the mortgage business.”He said that GE Money was known for subprime lending before the financial crisis. The lender subsequently offered mortgages to customers that “represent good credit risk but do not have a perfect credit score”.“GE Money falls into this capital category, so it’s likely private equity funds will look at buying the existing mortgage book and using it as a launch pad to get into the UK market,” he added.1890Four companies representing inventor Thomas Edison’s interests merge to form the Edison General Electric Company1932GE Credit Corporation begins to offer credit to customers to buy General Electric appliances1981Under chief executive Jack Welch, GE Capital begins a dramatic ascent.

17;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Warning signs after bumper IPO year;Clouds on horizon in main markets after 1,205 listings raise $258bn globally;The flotation of Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce group which raised a record $25bn on the New York Stock Exchange in September, emphasised the cross-border nature of what was a bumper year for initial public offerings.A total of 1,205 IPOs raised $258bn globally, the highest level since the financial crisis, according to Dealogic.Europe was the strongest performer, with an 87 per cent increase to $68.2m in the amount raised by IPOs, while the US saw a 54 per cent increase to $95.2bn and in Asia Pacific the total rose by a more modest 35 per cent.Apart from Alibaba, New York only had two other of the top 10 global IPOs — that of Citizens Financial, which raised $3.46bn in September, and Synchrony Financial, which raised $2.96bn in July.It was another US finance company, Pershing Square Holdings, that gave Europe its only place in the top 10 when it raised $2.75bn by floating on the Amsterdam exchange in October.Not all of the largest deals were cross-border. The second and third largest IPOs of the year saw National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, which raised $6bn, and the insurer Medibank Private of Australia, which raised $4.92bn, both float on their home exchanges.Two Chinese companies in the top 10 floated in Hong Kong — Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties, which raised $3.72bn, and CGN Power, a utility group, which raised $3.16bn. So too did a Hong Kong company, HK Electric Investments, which raised $3.11bn.International lawyers Baker & McKenzie said that while a significant slowdown in cross-border IPOs appeared unlikely in the short term, warning signs had begun to appear in all three main IPO regions.In Asia Pacific, companies had shown a growing interest in listing domestically, cutting into the number of cross-border IPOs. In North America, increased scrutiny of the variable interest entity structures that Chinese companies use to list on the region’s exchanges had generated concern among investors, while in Europe lower than expected after-market performance of several offerings had led to a flurry of IPO cancellations in the second half of the year.“The rapid increase in cross-border IPOs demonstrates that companies can see real benefits from looking beyond their domestic markets for raising capital,” said Koen Vanhaerents, chair of Baker & McKenzie’s global capital markets practice group.“However, with warning signs on the horizon, it is critical that companies carefully track global market conditions when considering their listing options in 2015.”

It has held discussions on a possible sale of the business that analysts have valued at $4bn to $5bn.“It might be cleaner to just sell OneMain to a single buyer but if the unit gets IPO’d there’s still value to be recognised there,” said one large Citi shareholder. “It all fits within the construct of the umbrella of restructuring and reducing the asset size of Citi Holdings.”Investors are watching the process closely as it will mark a milestone in the wind down of Citi Holdings, the bad bank created in 2009 under former chief executive Vikram Pandit. Citi Holdings reported its first quarterly profit in the period ended June 30.In May, Citi’s chief executive Mike Corbat, told an investor conference that the bank could dispose of OneMain via a sale to private equity, a public share sale or a combination of both. He said a disposal could come by the end of the year or in early 2015.Selling OneMain could allow Citi to utilise its deferred tax assets, an accounting quirk that rewards the bank for earnings generated in the US. The sale would also help strengthen the bank’s capital position.Citi this year failed the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test on a qualitative basis and was forced to cancel capital returns to shareholders.Analysts and bankers have suggested Springleaf as a possible acquirer of the unit because of its similar business model.While the regulatory environment may have deterred potential bank acquirers, the sale of OneMain to a nonbank also faces the hurdle of how to fund the company, which does not take deposits. This year, OneMain securitised its loans, demonstrating one potential funding stream.Other disposals of large US consumer businesses have gone down the IPO route. Royal Bank of Scotland’s US unit, Citizens went through with its share sale last month. The UK bank was forced to lower the offer price after pressure from investors.Synchrony Financial, the North American store credit business of General Electric, raised $2.9bn with an IPO at the low end of its price range.OneMain, the largest operating business in Citi Holdings, suffered severe losses during the crisis but has reported profits in recent years. Revenues in the first half shrank 2 per cent from a year earlier to $1.1bn, while profits rose 16 per cent to $287m.Mary McDowell, who joined Citi in 1999, is OneMain’s chief executive and is set to lead the company if it lists.
19;SYF;Synchrony Financial;2014-08-01T17:54:10Z;Busiest week for US IPOs since November 2007;;Companies rushed to list shares in the US ahead of the summer slowdown, in the busiest week for seven years, receiving a mixed response as the equity market sold off into the end of July.Synchrony Financial, the North American store credit business spun off from General Electric, and Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes technology that keeps cars from colliding, were among the 16 initial public offerings that had priced by midday on Friday, according to Dealogic. That was the largest weekly number of listings in the US since November 2007.The slew of deals is part of a banner year for IPOs. With equity markets touching new highs, the listings market has been open to a broad range of companies. So far this year, there have been 194 US-listed IPOs, raising $45.2bn, the highest by number and dollar amount raised since the same period of 2000.Of the deals that priced this week, 38 per cent were within the range indicated by the company, while 31 per cent were below that range and 31 per cent above it. Originally, about 25 companies were expected to list this week, but some have slipped into next week, after the equity market fell on Thursday.“Investors are being very selective,” said Frank Maturo, vice-chairman, equity capital markets, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They are picking winners, and those that they do not want to buy aggressively.”Mr Maturo said that IPOs from smaller capitalisation companies, particularly some healthcare shares, had been harder to sell to investors than some of the larger ones.The $2.875bn IPO of Synchrony – the biggest deal of the week and the largest Iisting on a US exchange in the year to date – was priced at $23, the bottom of the range, and shares have been flat in trading.People familiar with the listing said there had been demand for the new shares, but some investors were deterred by the recent weak performance of other consumer finance IPOs this year. Ally, formerly General Motors’ financing arm, is down 4 per cent, while Santander Consumer USA, another auto lender, has lost about 20 per cent.The standout was Mobileye. It priced shares at $25 – $2 above a price range that it had revised higher – and the stock surged more than 50 per cent on Friday. The company said in regulatory filings it was in a position to benefit from the “race to develop autonomous driving”.Brad Miller, co-head of equity capital markets syndicate at Deutsche Bank, said: “As long as the macroeconomic picture doesn’t erode, we should come back from Labour Day with a fairly robust calendar. We expect there to be more breadth to the business mix away from micro-cap growth stocks, and should see more issuance in sectors like industrials on the calendar.”
