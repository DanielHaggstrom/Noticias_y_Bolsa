0;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-02-06T06:45:26Z;Publicis maintains targets despite fourth-quarter slowdown;Chief insists ad group is on ‘right track’ but warns Accenture is now ‘major competitor’;Publicis suffered a fourth-quarter slowdown as big clients trimmed spending and restructuring took its toll but the advertising group said it would still hit its sales target this year.The results capped a difficult year as chief executive Arthur Sadoun seeks to reshape the company to cope with technological disruption and new competitors including consulting giant Accenture. “The magnitude of change at Publicis in the last year has been great and this hurt our performance,” Mr Sadoun told the Financial Times on Thursday. “But now our transformation, in terms of structure and assets, is complete and our recent new business wins show we are on the right track.”The company reported a 4.5 per cent decline in organic sales in the fourth quarter, on revenue of €2.9bn. This was slightly better than analysts’ expectations, and took the annual organic sales decline to 2.3 per cent. That key metric, which strips out currency effects and acquisitions and disposals, is tracked closely by investors and to compare the performances of ad groups. Shares rose 5 per cent in morning trading. Citi analyst Thomas Singlehurst said margins and cash flow were “very strong” despite weak organic sales growth. “There is still plenty to do in terms of the turnround, but this is a solid start,” he said.Net profit grew 9.8 per cent to reach €1.2bn last year, driven by an improved operating margin of 17.3 per cent. Earnings per share for the year reached €5.02.The company said 2020 organic sales growth would come in between a 2 per cent decline and a 1 per cent increase.Publicis, which competes with larger rivals WPP and Omnicom, is betting that its $4.4bn acquisition last year of Epsilon, a digital marketing agency that owns a trove of online and offline data on consumers, will help it better serve its big clients from consumer goods makers to banks.But investors still appear concerned that execution problems, management upheaval and repeated restructuring plans at Publicis are not over.Its shares have fallen nearly 30 per cent in the past year after it twice scaled back its growth guidance. WPP shares rose 10 per cent in the same period, while Omnicom shares were largely flat. It remains to be seen whether any of the big ad groups have figured out how to cope as Facebook and Google siphon off more ad dollars and big advertisers such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever do more work in-house. Another concern among investors has been Accenture’s aggressive expansion into digital marketing in the past five years via acquisitions, the hiring of top talent and organic growth. The consulting giant has built a business that brought in more than $10bn in annual revenue in its 2019 financial year. That compares with nearly $15bn annual sales for Omnicom and $12bn for Publicis.Mr Sadoun said Accenture’s recent decision to stop doing “media audits” for advertisers, to verify where marketing messages were placed, posed a threat to traditional agencies because it cleared the path for the consultancy to expand its “media buying” business. That service — by which agencies place ads across the web, on TV and on radio on behalf of clients — is a big profit generator for Publicis and its peers.“The choice they made is to go more frontally in our markets,” said Mr Sadoun. “Given that the market cap of Accenture is bigger than all the agency holding companies together, you realise that this will be a major competitor.” Nevertheless, the business model chosen by Publicis — namely to have creative, technology and data all housed under one roof — should help it resist Accenture’s competition. “An end-to-end model is the future of our industry,” said Mr Sadoun.
1;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-01-26T09:24:37Z;Facebook content moderators required to sign PTSD forms;Documents sent to employees at Accenture-operated European site;"Content moderators working at a European facility for Facebook have been required to sign a form explicitly acknowledging that their job could cause post-traumatic stress disorder, according to documentation and employee confirmation obtained by the Financial Times.The facility, which is operated by global professional services company Accenture, hosts roughly 400 content moderators who trawl through hundreds of disturbing images and videos — ranging from bestiality and child abuse to hate speech, self-harm and terrorism — across Facebook and Instagram every day.The moderators’ jobs entail making granular decisions about why each image or video is objectionable. One employee at the facility, who asked not to be named, said that people working there “cry every day”, and that many “take sick leave for mental health issues, sometimes three or six months”.Accenture runs at least three content moderation sites for Facebook in Europe, including in Warsaw, Lisbon and Dublin, where workplace safety rules are some of the most stringent in the world and include protections for mental health.The document was distributed to all moderators at the European facility in early January via email, asking them to sign it immediately. It stated: “I understand the content I will be reviewing may be disturbing. It is possible that reviewing such content may impact my mental health, and it could even lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).”The two-page form also outlines Accenture’s WeCare programme, which provides employees with access to “wellness coaches” from whom they can receive mental health support. The company says, however, that “the wellness coach is not a medical doctor and cannot diagnose or treat mental disorders”.Facebook is facing lawsuits in California brought by two former moderators, and a slew of personal injury claims in Ireland, where its international headquarters are based, brought by a dozen Facebook content moderators who have all experienced severe mental health conditions, ranging from panic attacks to PTSD.A similar document was also provided by Accenture to workers at a YouTube content moderation facility in Austin, Texas, according to the Verge.“Now we see it in black and white: Big Tech knows full well that content moderation causes PTSD in its workers,” said Cori Crider, director of Foxglove, a UK-based litigation non-profit organisation that is assisting with investigation, strategy and campaigning in one of the Irish cases.“The question is, when are Google and Facebook going to clean up their unsafe factory floor? Pushing responsibility on to the individual worker, as this document tries to do, won’t cut it. It’s on them to make their workplace safe.”A spokesperson for Accenture said: “Although targeted at new joiners, the document was also reissued to existing personnel, but there are no consequences for not signing the updated document.“We regularly update the information we give our people to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the work they do — and of the . . . wellness program and comprehensive support services we provide.”Facebook said it did not review or approve forms like the one Accenture had sent and was not aware that its content moderators were being asked to sign it. It did say, however, that it required its partners to offer extensive psychological support to its moderators on an ongoing basis.“Facebook themselves were part of an industry group called the Technology Coalition that proposed standards for protecting moderators’ mental health years ago — in 2015,” Ms Crider added. “But they didn’t follow those standards. So these companies are going to be hard pressed to say senior management weren’t aware of the problem.”According to an employee who signed one of these acknowledgment forms, every moderator at the facility was emailed a link and asked to sign immediately. The employee said they had seen multiple instances of severe mental health conditions among their colleagues, and had also been diagnosed with depression themselves, something they believed was exacerbated by their working conditions. However, they had never previously been asked to sign a form acknowledging the potential for damage to their health.“When I started to work there, I thought graphic violence and sexual and animal abuse would be the hardest part of this job for me, and I think they were,” said the moderator. “But if you work on hate speech six hours a day, five days a week, it gets to you. I’m a cis white heterosexual male, so I can’t imagine how it affects the people that represent minorities.”The moderator explained that it was not just the content that caused severe mental health problems among employees, but also that Accenture’s running of the facility contributed to the overall stress levels.“I would stress . . . that the employment conditions are a factor in the high rate of mental health problems in our workplace,” the person said. “When I started, we had five possible decisions to make; now there are more than 250 possible combinations of labels. The content policies are changing every two weeks.”Employees are expected to hit quality scores of 98 per cent, which means their decisions on why a piece of content is egregious have to match that of their quality reviewer in almost every instance.Every few minutes, a notification with quality scores pops up on an employee’s screen, showing them how many mistakes they have made. Their scores determine if their short-term contracts are terminated or extended. “The anticipation of the quality score is what is very stressful for me, and for most of us,” the person said.Facebook has chosen to outsource a strategic issue / From Per Bengtsson, Lisbon, Portugal"
2;ACN;Accenture Plc;2019-10-22T09:00:27Z;Companies must reconsider who it is they really serve;Millennial workers and consumers are demanding more purpose beyond simply profit;"I was raised in a Scottish manufacturing household, aware from an early age that every plate of food put in front of my sister and me was there because my dad made stuff and sold it abroad.Typically Presbyterian, we were taught to believe in hard work and playing by the rules. My parents, both brought up on Glasgow council estates, leaving school at 15 and 16 with few qualifications, were rightly proud to be able to raise their daughters in a home they had bought themselves and watch them become the first generation of the wider family to go to university.The system worked: they had put in the graft and saw themselves able to give their children a higher standard of living than they had themselves enjoyed. But somewhere along the line since then, that cycle has broken down.The Resolution Foundation has found that those born in 1980 earn 13 per cent less than somebody born in 1970 did at the same stage in life. Home ownership for those in their 30s has tumbled. With unemployment running at less than 4 per cent, there’s little problem finding work. But faith that a job will lead seamlessly to a secure life is through the floor. In a decade of working at the frontline of politics, the biggest concerns I’ve heard younger voters express are not about their own situations — environmental and ethical concerns top those. But when pressed, their immediate worries inevitably feature insecure employment and an inability to get on to the housing ladder.So millennials, both workers and consumers, are demanding something more: purpose beyond simply profit.According to Accenture’s global consumer research, 62 per cent of customers want companies “to take a stand” on issues such as sustainability, transparency and fair employment practices. Deloitte’s millennial survey reports only 27 per cent of employees believe profits should be companies’ primary goal. Weber Shandwick’s employee activism survey records 38 per cent of employees confirming they have spoken up to support or criticise their employers’ actions over a controversial issue.The Financial Times’ commitment towards resetting capitalism, seeking to restore faith in our wealth creators and businesses, is both welcome and pressing. Populist movements on both the left and right are seeking to exploit the justifiable sense of resentment at the system. If the centre is to hold, it must be prepared to respond. But how?First, we should defend the values on which that free-market order is based. For, however unfashionable these values are at present, they remain timeless. As Adam Smith wrote in the 18th century, even the selfish man knows that his interests are bound up in the fortunes of others. Thus, he knows his self-interest is dependent upon the interests of the community of which he is a part. Free markets, by their nature, require us to respect the common good. It is in all our interests to have businesses that prosper and succeed; the taxes they pay help fund our hospitals and schools.Then we need to look at sustainability in its truest sense. Corporations focused only on short-term shareholder value may hit six-monthly targets, but if, for example, that focus is at the expense of the environment, they can destroy the stability needed for long-term viability.Further, corporations need to look beyond simply delivering for their shareholders and address the needs of the wider groups they serve; their stakeholders. And here we see real movement. In August, the Business Roundtable — America’s senior business leaders’ forum — put out a statement redefining the purpose of a corporation. It focused on five key areas: delivering value to customers, investing in employees, dealing fairly and ethically with suppliers, supporting the environment and generating long-term value for shareholders.These are deep commitments and go far beyond the sort of exercises that saw companies strive to maximise profits, then tip their hats to corporate social responsibility by sponsoring a local children’s sports team. True stakeholder value is built through authentic actions. Whether that’s Velvet planting three trees for every one it uses to create its toilet tissue, or Dove’s commitment to real beauty by launching a body confidence curriculum that has reached millions of young people around the world.Both employees and customers are increasingly willing to put their money where their mouths are: making decisions about where to work or what to buy, not just based simply on income or cost. If they are willing to look beyond the bottom line, they expect corporations to do the same. Companies failing to respond to this new reality may face a turbulent future.The writer is an MSP and former leader of the Scottish Conservative partyRights without obligations to others are unsustainable / From Martyn Roetter, Boston, MA, US"
3;ACN;Accenture Plc;2019-07-11T20:16:17Z;Accenture promotes North America boss to global CEO;Julie Sweet will be first woman to lead the consulting firm;Julie Sweet has been named chief executive of Accenture, becoming the first female leader of the consulting giant as it expands its focus on technological and digital transformation.Ms Sweet, who currently runs Accenture North America, will succeed David Rowland, who has served as interim chief executive since the company’s popular leader Pierre Nanterme stepped down shortly before his death in January.Trained as a lawyer, Ms Sweet started her career at the venerable New York law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where she was a partner for 10 years before joining Accenture as general counsel. She will take charge of a Fortune 500 company with a market capitalisation of $130bn.“My legal training has helped me be a quick learner,” Ms Sweet said in an interview with the Financial Times. “As leaders we really have to be continuous learners so my background has prepared me well to navigate what is now a complicated and fast-moving environment.”I’m talking to chief executives every day and the number one issue is how to bring your workforce along to match the changes in technologyAccenture began as the consulting arm of accounting giant Arthur Andersen and became a public company in 2001. During Mr Nanterme’s eight years at the helm, the firm shifted its focus to high-growth areas, including digital, cloud-computing and security-related services as well as digital advertising.Ms Sweet, 51, played down her status as the first woman to run the organisation, although the California native has been vocal about her desire to promote gender equality and level the playing field for women.“I am focused today on the fact that I’m the fifth chief executive of Accenture since we became a public company,” she said. “We think it is important to not focus on only one element of diversity.”Calling Accenture a technology company at its core, Ms Sweet said the company is leading the way for gender diversity in the field. Of the company’s 500,000 employees, 43 per cent are women.When Ms Sweet joined the consulting firm in 2010, Accenture was just embarking on a period of growth that would see it more than double its headcount and spend more than $6bn on acquisitions. The North American division she has run since 2015 is the largest within Accenture, accounting for almost 50 per cent of its global revenues.The company, which counts 92 of the Fortune 100 companies as clients, has promised to invest heavily in training workers who face losing their jobs to automation, and has launched a national professional apprentice programme in the US that provides technology skills training.“I’m talking to chief executives every day and the number one issue is how to bring your workforce along to match the changes in technology,” Ms Sweet said.“It is not just about a skills gap, you cannot simply say I am just going to go hire other people . . . it is about how you can make sure that people can use the technology to unlock these opportunities.”Outside of Accenture, Ms Sweet sits on the board of Catalyst, a non-profit organisation led by Lorraine Hariton that works with chief executives to help accelerate women into leadership positions. She also serves on the board of the TechNet Executive Council, which works to promote growth in the digital economy.Ms Sweet will start her new role in September and Mr Rowland will become the company’s executive chairman.
4;ACN;Accenture Plc;2019-02-01T18:34:48Z;Pierre Nanterme, business executive, 1959-2019;Accenture’s popular leader described as kind, principled and cool-headed;Pierre Nanterme was not one to make a fuss. The softly spoken Lyonnais was on a business trip in the South of France in 2010 when he first found out he had been chosen to be the next chief executive of Accenture, one of the world’s largest consulting firms. Never a big drinker, he celebrated by having a glass of Cognac with a handful of colleagues, and went to bed before midnight. Mr Nanterme, who died this week aged 59 from colon cancer, was a popular leader who has been described by colleagues as kind, principled and cool-headed. Most of all they remember his humour.The son of a French sales executive and a shopkeeper, Mr Nanterme was known for lightheartedly teasing British colleagues about French battle victories won several centuries ago. The history buff would often start meetings by quoting French military leaders Napoleon and Lafayette, although he also found time to reference two of his greatest idols: former British prime minister Winston Churchill and Formula 1 racing driver Stirling Moss. Two of his favourite Churchill quotes reflected his own views on how best to lead a company that employs nearly half a million staff across 120 countries. “If you don’t take change by the hand, it will take you by the throat,” he would tell colleagues when trying to push a new strategy through. A second Churchill quote was printed on a placard that rested on his desk in Paris: “To improve is to change, to be perfect is to change often.”Business is very serious, but we can have fun doing businessMr Nanterme certainly changed Accenture, overseeing the most dynamic period in the company’s 30-year history since he became its fifth chief executive in 2011. During his tenure the firm — best known for selling technology advice to some of the world’s largest companies — invested more than $6bn in 100 acquisitions, and more than doubled headcount to 469,000. Accenture’s net revenues grew by 55 per cent to $40bn over that period, while its market cap increased by $70bn to $108bn. Much of the growth was driven by Mr Nanterme’s conviction that the company should focus on high-growth areas, including digital, cloud and security-related services. One of his earliest changes was to invest heavily in digital advertising, a shift that enabled Accenture to compete successfully in that area with ad giants such as WPP and Omnicom. Despite these results, Mr Nanterme remained humble and self-deprecating — and welcomed being teased in return. “Business is very serious, but we can have fun doing business,” he would tell colleagues. When excited about a topic, he would on occasion break into a monologue. Afterwards he would joke about how succinct he was. He was also known for invoking an old Accenture tradition — giving retiring partners a watch — when management conversations about strategy became tense. “For those of you not with me on this, of course we can provide a watch,” he would say with a smile. His colleagues would joke in response: “Will I get a Rolex or a Swatch?”Although fiercely private, the father-of-one brought his personality and warmth to the workplace. His office was covered in Moss memorabilia, including a framed steering wheel from one of the driver’s cars. It was also dotted with small frogs made from stone, mother-of-pearl and obsidian — good luck charms he collected over decades. Colleagues who worked with him for years have said they never heard him raise his voice, even during some of the toughest periods for Accenture — including the Dotcom crash at the turn of the millennium and the 2008 financial crisis. Often found reading the Figaro newspaper in Accenture’s canteen, he was known for referring to the company as his family, and to himself as the “team captain” rather than its CEO. His death — just three weeks after he stood down as CEO — has triggered an outpouring of grief from colleagues, clients and competitors on social media. “It’s hard to find the words to express how deeply saddened I am by this morning’s news of Pierre Nanterme’s passing,” said Hewlett-Packard CEO Antonio Neri on Twitter. “Pierre was an exceptionally visionary leader & a passionate equality advocate, with an innate drive for growth and a contagious energy. He will be sorely missed.” Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP, added: “Not enough room to describe the full measure of the man. Class, character and integrity personified. May his family get comfort from all the lives he made better. RIP good friend.” Mr Nanterme is survived by his wife, his 19-year-old daughter and his parents.

6;ACN;Accenture Plc;2018-11-26T22:56:18Z;Asset managers under fire over costs and profits;Accenture research says investment banks destroying shareholder value;Asset managers and investment banks must do much more to cut costs and improve their profits, according to new research from Accenture.Investment banks in Europe and Asia are not earning their cost of equity, while big asset managers are failing to take advantage of their scale, the consultancy said.“Unfortunately for capital markets participants, the days of old are truly gone,” said Michael Spellacy, global capital markets lead at Accenture.“The majority of European and Asian investment banks are net destroyers of shareholder value,” he said. “You can’t run a business like this any longer.”Capital markets firms made just over $1tn of revenue and earned $107bn of economic profit in 2017, according to the report, which looked at the industry’s profitability last year. It analysed more than 100 capital markets groups.Asset managers and hedge funds did far better than the investment banks.The 12 biggest investment banks earned a net $600m of profit, which was just 0.3 per cent of their revenues. In contrast, asset managers earned $31bn of profit and hedge funds earned $16bn, both keeping about 15 per cent of their revenues as profit.Unfortunately for capital markets participants, the days of old are truly goneThe report comes at a time of upheaval for capital markets companies, as they cope with a much-increased regulatory burden following the crisis and greater competition.Research by the Financial Times earlier this year showed that the world’s top investment banks made more money last year than in the year before Lehman Brothers’ collapse, but many are at the same time struggling to adapt their businesses and cut costs.Deutsche Bank earlier this year indicated it was reducing its corporate finance and trading activities in the US. Bank of America, meanwhile, is planning to hire up to 50 senior dealmakers to revitalise its investment bank after a slide in fees.Performance among banks is highly varied, according to the report.While some investment banks in Europe and Asia offering a full range of services are not earning their cost of equity, some major US banks are doing much better. Being big is not critical to making money — the most profitable mid-sized global banks have similar profit margins to the biggest players.Asset managers, meanwhile, which have enjoyed huge inflows from investors since the crisis, are earning far higher margins as a group.But many still have not properly cut costs that are often a legacy from pre-crisis days, argued Accenture. While managing assets should yield large economies of scale, some mid-sized companies are earning the same margins as the industry’s biggest players, according to the report.Mr Spellacy questioned why any asset manager in central London or New York had 300 to 400 people calculating net asset values for funds all day long. “You don’t need teams of portfolio managers tracking the benchmark,” he added.The report also highlighted cryptocurrencies’ extraordinary boom last year. It put total revenue earned by crypto exchange and servicing firms at $16bn in 2017, just behind the $17bn in total earned by traditional exchanges.
7;ACN;Accenture Plc;2018-06-27T04:00:29Z;Accenture UK profits hit by charge over tax probe;Consultancy accounts for £77m payment after HMRC investigation;Accenture’s UK profits nearly halved last year after the US-listed consultancy was forced to account for a £77m payment to HM Revenue & Customs following a probe into its tax affairs over an eight-year period.The charge meant that even though Accenture’s UK revenues and profits before tax increased in 2017, net profits fell from £125m to £67m, according to filings submitted to Companies House.Accenture, which employs 442,000 staff across 55 countries, said the HMRC probe related to the period from 2009 to 2016. “The discussions are related to a transfer pricing inquiry of routine transactions in the period,” it added.The tax charge is the latest in a series of tax-related controversies for Accenture, which provides technology and IT advice to some of the world’s largest companies and organisations — including HMRC.The consultancy’s approach to tax drew widespread criticism in 2012 after it emerged its UK tax bill for the previous year was just under £3m on profits of £82m — an effective tax rate of 3.4 per cent.Margaret Hodge, the Labour politician and then chair of Britain’s public accounts committee, said she would press HMRC to investigate why Accenture — an important supplier of IT services — had such a low tax bill.In 2010 Accenture paid tax of £2.9m on profits of £123m, and in 2009 it paid £2.8m tax on profits of £64m — effective tax rates of 2 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively.HMRC said: “We do not comment on identifiable taxpayers. We make sure that large businesses, just like everyone else, pay all the taxes due under UK law.”Accenture said: “Between 2007 to 2011 Accenture’s UK tax payments were reduced by contract losses brought forward from 2006, which are not related to the ongoing HMRC inquiry.”The consultancy disclosed in 2016 that it was under investigation by Swiss authorities over the tax treatment of an intercompany transfer of intellectual property from 2010. The company’s US annual report said the matter was resolved in 2017 and resulted in a payment for “prior year taxes”.Accenture, which was spun out of the now defunct accounting firm Arthur Andersen in 1989, shifted its place of incorporation from Bermuda to Ireland in 2009.It said at the time it was aware of “criticism of and negative publicity regarding” companies that were incorporated in countries that did not have tax treaties with the US, including Bermuda.The company’s most recent US annual report stated that its incorporation in Ireland may also trigger “criticism and negative publicity”.It added that the overall tax environment “has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions”, citing the European Commission’s focus on state-aid rules and the preferential tax treatment some companies have received as an example.Accenture’s disclosure about the UK tax charge comes a few months after it emerged that Apple, the technology group, was forced to hand over additional payments of £81m and £136m to HMRC.
8;ACN;Accenture Plc;2018-06-26T21:00:28Z;Do the right thing: the counsel driving diversity and inclusion;Achieving more diversity in the workforce is moving up the agenda for in-house teams and law firms;When the US state of Georgia tried to pass a law in 2016 that many believed would legalise discrimination against LGBT+ people, Marc Benioff took a stand. The founder and chief executive of Salesforce, the sales tech software company, joined 500 other companies in opposing the bill. He warned on Twitter that if Georgia’s governor did not veto the bill, which would allow vendors to deny services based on a “sincerely held religious belief”, Salesforce “would have to reduce investments” in the state. It worked.This was an echo of an earlier effort in Indiana by the San Francisco-based Salesforce and other businesses with operations in the state, such as Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly, to amend a 2015 bill that employees were concerned would lead to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Salesforce takes such actions, he later told the Financial Times, “because they are what our employees demand”.Companies have public platforms in ways they never had in the past . . . Indiana was a bit of a watershed moment for corporations, and seeing what they can doAmy Weaver, general counsel of Salesforce, flew to Indiana to rally support from other concerned business leaders. By the end of the week, she says, they had drafted an amendment that would prevent the law being used for discrimination. Mike Pence, now vice-president of the US, who was at the time Indiana’s socially conservative governor, came under pressure to protect the state’s business interests and signed the amendment.“Companies have public platforms in ways they never had in the past,” says Ms Weaver. “[Indiana] was a bit of a watershed moment for corporations, and seeing what they can do.”As businesses find their feet in driving policy changes in districts where they have interests, as well as within their own organisations, general counsel are taking on a bigger role in supporting this evolution.Ms Weaver says the move towards large-scale social responsibility has been the biggest shift during her career as a general counsel. “In law school when they ask you, ‘What’s the role of a corporation?’ [The answer] is just ‘do no harm, give a little back to a little-league [baseball] team.’ There was no concept of companies stepping up the way they are today.”Much of the change, she says, is driven by employees. “People are seeking a purpose.”Companies looking to attract top talent to their legal teams are taking note.Lucy Ricca, a lecturer at Stanford Law School and executive director of the Stanford Center on the Legal Profession, says a company’s culture “matters a lot to the vast majority of our students, who are some of the most elite students in the country . . . They have high expectations for institutions prioritising diversity and recognising that it makes a better and more competitive workplace.”Employers are familiar with the argument that diverse workforces improve the bottom line. A 2017 McKinsey study, called Delivering Through Diversity, found a statistically significant relationship between a company’s diversity and better financial performance.Diversity is a broad term that encompasses gender, ethnicity, socio-economic background, as well as physical and developmental disabilities. Achieving more diverse legal talent is on the minds of both in-house teams and law firms: how to attract it, keep it and best accommodate it.Meaningful change involves going beyond minimum regulatory standards, says Chad Jerdee, general counsel and chief compliance officer at Accenture. Mr Jerdee lost a leg in a head-on crash with a drunk driver and, after a long recovery, wears a prosthetic.“Usually diversity policies are loosely affiliated with employee resource groups,” he says, referring to initiatives for staff around a shared interest. Mr Jerdee, however, wanted to build a programme that was more consistent and strategic in how the consultancy governed initiatives and recruitment for employees with disabilities. Accenture’s Persons with Disabilities programme helps accommodate employees with physical and cognitive impairments through specialised software, workstations and mentoring, and has become a model for others.Mr Jerdee’s team takes its lead from those it serves: 60 per cent of the team involved in developing and implementing the company’s adaptive technology have a disability.He emphasises that making an organisation’s culture more inclusive requires buy-in at the very top, with senior leaders setting and managing measurable targets for disability inclusion. Accenture’s global legal team relies on data to track how they are meeting diversity recruitment targets and retaining talent. “You don’t achieve things if you don’t measure them.”GCs can play a vital role, he says: “Whatever general counsel does needs to be a part of the general culture of the company. Focusing just on compliance is selling the function short.”As the way companies work evolves, the role of the general counsel in increasing diversity is changing, too. At Salesforce, Ms Weaver says: “We are in uncharted waters. The role of a company as a platform for change is evolving rapidly. For general counsel, we constantly have to be focused on the values of the company. We have to do this with all of our stakeholders in mind — our shareholders, our employees, our customers, our partners and our communities.”$3mAmount Salesforce paid to close gender pay gap — more than onceSometimes the challenge for a company is to look inwards to ask where problems may exist, even if they do not know what the outcome will be. After a public announcement in 2015, Salesforce commissioned a company-wide study into salaries of its employees to understand its gender pay gap. The legal and human resources teams worked to analyse the results of the survey, and the company found that 6 per cent of employees earned less than peers of the opposite gender for the same work. The company paid out $3m to even the gap.The next year, Salesforce added a new set of criteria to the survey, broadening the definition of diversity. Again, it paid out $3m. The initiative was repeated again this past year, revealing a gap of $2.7m. “It shows that there isn’t a finish line on this,” Ms Weaver says. “You can’t just do this and declare victory. You have to keep setting goals.”“Thinking, ‘we’re not just going to do a one-off’ is so important,” says Gretchen Bellamy, a former assistant general counsel at Walmart who now works as a diversity and inclusion consultant and chairs the commission on Racial and Ethnic Diversity in the Profession for the American Bar Association. Finding solutions that are sustainable is a business imperative, she adds. “If you have a company that operates in 28 different countries around the world, if you have a diverse customer base and you want to carry the products that people want to buy, diversity has to touch every bit of the business.”“Sustainable businesses have healthy cultures. They’re ethical, they’re diverse,” says Mr Jerdee. For a company to be sustainable in today’s market, its culture must be healthy across the organisation.Mr Jerdee says: “We are competing for talent in the marketplace. The nature of what we do is provide clients with thoughtful creative ideas to solve their business problems. If we don’t have a diverse workforce we can’t provide quality solutions to our clients. It’s also just the right thing to do.”The interaction between general counsel and law firms is an essential component of helping both reach their diversity goals, says Gretchen Bellamy (pictured above), chair of the commission on Racial and Ethnic Diversity in the Profession for the American Bar Association (ABA).General counsel, eager to work with more diverse groups of lawyers, can press law firms to develop diverse teams or risk losing their contracts. But GCs need to be careful not to set unrealistic goals at the expense of minority lawyers at firms, who are often in short supply and high demand. They risk being put on a single client account, warns Ms Bellamy. Only a quarter of Fortune 500 general counsel are women and 10 per cent are from minority ethnic groups, according to a 2018 ABA survey.Ms Bellamy advises firms to communicate with GCs about their diversity goals, rather than reaching them by restricting the options of diverse lawyers, which can hold them back in their careers. She says retention of diverse staff remains a challenge for firms, as lawyers become frustrated with the lack of options and leave.
9;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;ACN;Accenture Plc;2018-05-31T03:00:29Z;Intersectionality: look at the individual, not the minority group;Empathy and inclusion are key to making most of employees with many identities;During the wave of racial violence in the US in the summer of 2016, Ellyn Shook had a conversation with a black colleague she was mentoring that made her reconsider Accenture’s approach to diversity and inclusion.“It was the anger and frustration he was feeling about not being able to have a conversation about it at work when it was affecting him, both as a father, scared that his children would be shot, and his own safety and wellbeing.”Ms Shook, Accenture’s chief leadership and HR officer in New York, realised the professional services firm needed to find a way to allow staff to talk about their feelings, particularly ones that may not always be obvious or apparent to their colleagues.“We have had to push past looking at diversity in silos and really look at it from a human perspective,” she says.Many companies still consider diversity policies solely in terms of dealing with separate categories of gender, ethnicity, sexuality, socio-economic class, religion or disability. However, a better awareness of how these strands overlap — a concept known as intersectionality — can improve an organisation’s understanding of its staff.Jill Miller, a policy adviser at the UK’s Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says treating categories such as women as one homogenised cohort in the workplace is not always appropriate.“It is often easier to implement blanket policies,” she says. “[But] with inclusion there is no silver bullet. Each person’s experience is unique.”A CIPD report on the barriers to black, Asian and minority ethnic career progression, found that 40 per cent of the 1,290 people (white and non-white British) surveyed did not think their company had an inclusive culture.Treating people as individuals is key to improving this perception, she says. Taking an intersectional view means recognising individuals can have multiple identities that overlap, for example an Asian LGBT woman or a white disabled man.Jonathan Ashong Lamptey, director of The Resource Groups Company, a consultancy that helps organisations to improve performance through inclusive practices, says that although the term “‘intersectionality” gets thrown around, companies do not always know what to do with it.“People often focus on the discrimination side,” he says. “You hear people talk about a double whammy: a black woman will have race and gender going against her.”However, while some people have a number of disadvantages, this does not mean they do not also have privilege. Citing himself as an example, he says: “Being a 6ft 2 man has its advantages in the workplace but being black has disadvantages, at different times and different places.”The way to build empathy, foster inclusiveness and create trust in the workplace, according to Mr Ashong Lamptey, is to discuss difficult topics in employee groups or staff networks that share a common identity. “Instead of guessing, ask the people who are having those experiences,” he says.Accenture set up a number of discussion groups with the theme of “Building Bridges”. The first focused on race, another looked at religion. In Black History Month, the groups discussed topics such as what it means to be a black LGBT person, using the opportunity to address questions beyond race.Ms Shook explains that the groups are led by staff but have the full backing of leadership. The goal is that “hard conversations become part of the mainstream”, she says.Sonia Meggie, a diversity adviser for Business in the Community who has worked with organisations on inclusion, agrees that open dialogue is important, as without it people often make assumptions about others. She gives the example of a Muslim woman who was not invited to drinks after work because her colleagues assumed she would not want to go.An online guide entitled “Let’s talk about race” was one of the organisation’s most downloaded items, she says, indicating an appetite for more open conversations.As well as the standard inclusive leadership training, Ms Meggie advocates “reverse mentoring” whereby managers are mentored by a minority ethnic staff member. This can give them useful insights into the experience of colleagues who may feel they have to fit in with the cultural mores of the majority at work.None of these initiatives is a quick fix. “Organisations should make this part of a long-term strategy,” Mr Ashong Lamptey says.Ignoring the need for diversity together with inclusion risks “cutting yourself from the best talent,” says Ms Shook. When people do not feel they belong “you are not unlocking their full potential”, she adds. “It’s important to listen and connect with people. You can’t do this from the ivory tower.”This article has been amended since publication to reflect Mr Ashong Lamptey’s current occupation.
11;ACN;Accenture Plc;2018-05-10T03:00:30Z;How flexible attitudes can help disabled staff pull their weight;Acknowledging employee needs is the first step to solving problems;Jim Stearns, an international trade lawyer based in Washington DC who has cerebral palsy, recalls a previous employer who tried to keep him off a high-profile account. “There was a misplaced perception by some in the law firm that I couldn’t handle the long hours,” he recounts.In contrast, current employer Accenture seeks Mr Stearns’ opinion on what would help him in his work. His company, for example, has recognised his wheelchair use can make travelling difficult and has excused him from doing so. “But in the case of a conference I really wanted to attend, my supervisor went to great lengths to assist me — on the flights, using local transportation and pushing me in a manual chair when my electric one broke during the conference,” he says.“Reasonable accommodations” or adjustments are often catch-all descriptions for making physical changes to the workplace such as installing wheelchair lifts or supplying adapted keyboards. For many staff, however, the best solution to workplace problems due to a disability is one that costs little: a flexible attitude towards working patterns.“Employers have tended to put people with disabilities in the legal compliance box, focusing on reasonable accommodations like ramps and automatic doors, but we’re now starting to see more holistic programmes,” says Chad Jerdee, global sponsor for Accenture’s People With Disabilities programme. As an amputee, Mr Jerdee says he knows what it feels like to have people make assumptions about what he can and cannot do. “There is actually little understanding about how easy it can be to accommodate a person with a disability,” he says.Some employers are trying to create more inclusive workplaces by continuing to set broad work targets, but affording staff with a disability greater flexibility with working hours and location to meet these demands. That can be as simple as allowing a flexible start time, agreeing a reduction in working hours or an exemption from working overtime, granting more frequent or longer rest breaks, or exploring ways for a worker who cannot drive because of a disability to travel for business by some other means.Whatever the specific need, the key to understanding and meeting that need is often better communication with employees who have a disability. At Ultra Testing, a New York company that has built its workforce around people on the autism spectrum, this communication takes the form of a “user manual” in which the employee lists 28 characteristics about themselves that might help colleagues understand them better. This guide often includes entries on “work habits that assist”, “ways colleagues can provide feedback” or even “potential triggers”.According to co-founder Rajesh Anandan, better understanding the individual needs of any employee gets to the heart of how to work more effectively with him or her. “We don’t see any of the changes we’re making to business processes and practices as ‘accommodations’ but rather improvements on an outdated system,” he says.Other, larger employers are using employee resource groups (ERGs) with a disability focus to help them understand and design more inclusive workplaces. Minnesota-based conglomerate 3M’s disability awareness network has helped design flexible work arrangements and an employee assistance programme that offers consultation on subjects ranging from maximising effectiveness at work to navigating family and relationship issues.Employers have tended to put people with disabilities in the legal compliance boxResearch by Cornell University shows that companies with strong senior management commitment to hiring people with disabilities are five times more likely to hire people with a disability. However, the principal players in determining whether those people actually stay — because their requests for assistance are heard and heeded — are line managers and supervisors, warns Professor Susanne Bruyère, director of Cornell’s K. Lisa Yang and Hock E. Tan Institute on Employment and Disability.“Line managers and supervisors need to be aware of what a critical role they play in creating and building an inclusive workplace,” says Prof Bruyère. “They need to know that this is part of the organisation’s mission and that they are contributing to a strategic business imperative.”Nasser Siabi, whose Microlink business helps employers make adjustments for workers with a disability, agrees that managers can be obstructive. “Line managers are often the biggest blockers because they are worried about the cost of adjustments coming out of their budget.“So yes, you’ve got to win their hearts and minds, but also remove from them the responsibility for the cost,” says Mr Siabi, who points to the example of Lloyds Banking Group, where the cost for an adaptation is now taken from a central rather than departmental budget.Employees are often fearful to discuss with line managers their need for an accommodation, believing it could negatively affect their performance evaluations and job security, says Mr Stearns.“Employers must dispel this perception and eliminate any bias, conscious or unconscious, they might hold, including the belief that providing accommodations will be extremely costly for the organisation.”This article has been amended since publication to provide the full name of Cornell’s institute on Employment and Disability
12;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Infosys/Indian outsourcers: visa for value;New boss will be looking to close gap with Tata Consultancy Services;Complaints about immigration and discord in the executive suite are a feature of the current White House administration. Indian IT outsourcer Infosys is plagued by remarkably similar issues. Expect the latter to address its problems more swiftly. On Friday, it reported 7 per cent growth in full-year revenues to $10.9bn. In spite of recent troubles the group looks — steady.The company has managed to maintain market share during a tricky period. A former chief executive left in August, reacting  to ongoing criticism from one of the company founders. Another founder, Nandan Nilekani, rejoined the group as non-executive chairman to stabilise the situation. A new boss, Salil Parekh, started  in January. A company outsider, he may have a stronger hand in pushing back against powerful internal forces, as the company attempts to reduce its vulnerability to a globalisation backlash.Broader trends support optimism. Research firm Gartner predicts 5 per cent annual growth in global IT service spending until 2021, as companies upgrade to counter cyber threats and benefit from smarter data use. The financial services sector, from which Infosys derives roughly a third of revenues, is expected to accelerate its spending.Infosys makes more than half of revenues in the US — where President Trump has grumbled about Indian IT outsourcers’ use of US visas. Applications for the most contentious H-1B visa category declined by 38 per cent in two years, according to US Dept of Labor data analysed by the San Francisco Chronicle. Yet this has barely dented the ability of Indian groups to capture market share from western providers such as IBM and Accenture. Their slice of global IT service revenues rose to one quarter of the total in 2017, double what it was eight years ago.After he has stabilised the business, Mr Parekh will be measured on his ability to grow market share against rival Tata Consultancy Services. The ratio of price to earnings at Infosys is near 15, a quarter below Tata. If Mr Parekh succeeds, expect the gap to narrow.

14;ACN;Accenture Plc;2018-02-12T05:00:30Z;Drillers turn to big data in the hunt for more, cheaper oil;Under pressure from renewables, energy groups are again looking to tech for answers;"Just a few miles down the road from Facebook’s headquarters, Schlumberger’s Software Technology Innovation Center in leafy Menlo Park feels like just another Silicon Valley business with dreams of changing the world.Walls are covered with Post-it notes with ideas for product features and design principles, and the canteen has bowls of fruit and a shared pizza delivery every Friday lunchtime. Some of the engineers use standing desks and balance boards to exercise while they work. They are drawn from a diverse range of countries and industry backgrounds: one was at Nasa before coming here, another worked for HBO.Like many successful engineers in northern California, Ashok Belani, Schlumberger’s executive vice-president for technology and the force behind the centre, drives a Tesla to work.What Schlumberger is doing, however, is far from typical for Silicon Valley: it is working to increase output and cut costs for an activity at the heart of the old economy, oil and gas production.The technology centre that the oilfield services group has created is a sign of the huge changes under way in oil and gas, as the industry begins to adopt the latest innovations in information technology. Techniques such as advanced data analytics, used by Google, Facebook, Amazon and others mainly to disrupt consumer-facing businesses, are now increasingly being applied to the energy industry. Many oil executives believe the results could be similarly dramatic.The new opportunities being opened up include analysis of rocks to target wells more precisely in oil-bearing areas, reservoir models to enable production to be maximised through the lifetime of an oilfield, and automation that can make operations safer, more efficient and cheaper.The increased production made possible by these innovations will put downward pressure on oil prices, creating headwinds for competing technologies including electric cars, and potential difficulties for producers in other countries that are not able to cut their costs the same way. It will also mean disruption for many in the oil industry, with job losses and changes in working patterns and culture.Matt Rogers of McKinsey, the consultancy, says forecasters have failed to grasp fully the scale of the coming changes. “I don’t think we’ve built into our supply-side models just how much more oil this will provide,” he says. “The world in 10 years will feel very different . . . It’s going to feel like we’re in Star Wars compared to where we are now.”Number of sensors collecting data in Chevron oilfield in KazakhstanIEA estimate of cut in oil production costs from digital technologiesThe oil industry has for decades been at the cutting edge of advances in information technology. John Browne, the former chief executive of BP, began his career at the end of the 1960s mapping oil reservoirs in Alaska using a computer that was the state of the art at the time. On the Top 500 list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers today, the leading private sector owners include Total and Eni, the French and Italian oil groups, and Petroleum Geo Services, a reservoir imaging company.The difference now is the rise of cloud computing services, which make it possible to store and analyse data at a relatively low cost, opening up possibilities for new applications for a much wider range of companies. The oil industry generates large volumes of data, both structured, such as temperature and pressure readings; and unstructured, such as video footage — and the quantity is growing all the time. The cost of sensors for collecting more data are falling and their sophistication rising, making it possible to monitor more aspects of an operation such as drilling a well.Bill Braun, chief information officer of Chevron, the US oil group, says the volume of data the company handles has been doubling every 12-18 months. The expansion of its Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan, scheduled to start production in 2022, will include about 1m sensors.Much of the industry’s data are never used, however. “A lot of data are collected, but a lot of it is very isolated,” says Binu Mathew, head of product management for digital at Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group majority owned by General Electric. “Only a small percentage of it is actually being analysed.”Al Walker, chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum, a US independent oil producer, observed at the CERAWeek conference in Houston last year that although the company recorded a lot of data, “we don’t do that much with it”. He added: “I have terabytes and terabytes of seismic data, and I might use 5 per cent of that.”Now that is changing. Data that have been collected on engineers’ laptops, or on paper, out in the field, and sometimes copied over by hand, can instead be transferred automatically back to the office. Old records stretching back decades are being converted into coherent data sets. A survey of oil executives last year by Accenture, another consultancy, found 70 per cent of them expected to invest more in digital technologies, with data storage and services the top priorities. It has become a cliché to say that “ data are the new oil” — many companies are now looking for ways to turn data into oil.There has been a spate of alliances between IT companies and oil companies. Microsoft last year signed strategic partnerships with Halliburton, another large oilfield services group, and with Chevron. Nvidia, which makes high-performance chips first used in the video game industry, has been working with Schlumberger, Halliburton and others to adapt its technology for viewing and interpreting seismic information. A year ago it announced a partnership with Baker Hughes on using artificial intelligence to help extract and process oil and gas.The new technologies are creating business opportunities. Schlumberger, now the world’s largest listed oilfield services group, was founded by two French brothers who in 1926 launched a company to use electrical measurements to map rocks below the surface. Understanding what is happening in oil and gas reservoirs below the surface is still the company’s core competency, but it is increasing the range of services it can provide. Last year it launched a new software system called Delfi, which makes it possible to bring together and co-ordinate the way wells are designed, drilled and brought into production, to maximise output from an entire oilfield.Mr Belani hopes that by the end of this year, oil companies will be using the technology “on a regular basis” in the US and around the world. In the shale oilfields of the US, the new system could cut production costs by 40 per cent within the next decade, he says.Other estimates of the impact of digital technologies are more modest. The International Energy Agency, the habitually cautious government-backed watchdog, last year suggested it could cut oil and gas production costs by 10-20 per cent.But Mr Belani says digitalisation represents a “step change” in the industry’s economics, just like the advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing that first made production of shale gas commercially viable, about 15 years ago.“It might help keep oil prices at the reasonable levels, meaning in the $60s, and let everyone produce economically,” he says.Like Schlumberger, GE has chosen to put some of its digital operations in the San Francisco Bay area, to develop links with local IT businesses and with Stanford University, and to draw on the region’s pool of talent.Across the bay from Silicon Valley, in San Ramon, Baker Hughes has a digital technology centre in a building shared with the software operations of its parent GE. It also shares GE’s software platform, Predix, which it uses for applications for oil and gas.One of the parts of the industry that is moving fastest to grasp the potential of the new technologies has been the shale business in North America. Many thousands of wells are drilled there every year, making it possible to learn from past efforts and quickly apply those lessons. There have been spectacular increases in productivity, driven in recent years by refinements that are sometimes referred to as “shale 2.0”, including drilling longer horizontal wells. But progress so far has largely been a matter of trial and error: experimenting with a new technique and keeping going if it seems to work.Data analytics offer a chance to make that experimentation more scientific and inject new life into productivity. Some early results have been promising: BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley said last week that it had worked with a Silicon Valley start-up to develop an optimisation model, and had been able to raise production at the 180 wells in its pilot project by 20 per cent.The potential gains are huge. Companies are recovering only about 8-10 per cent of the oil in place in US shale, so if new systems could raise that rate by even a few percentage points, the results would be dramatic.There is also a lot of scope for automation in shale. Today there might be 26 people in a drilling rig crew, Mr Belani says. In five years’ time there could be just five.Mr Braun says that now, “humans are largely driving the drill bit. But we believe that will increasingly be automated and turned over to a computer, just like an autopilot in an aircraft.”Automation is already on the rise. Schlumberger has started shifting its horizontal drilling experts from out in the field to its Houston offices, from where they can watch over operations for six wells at a time, instead of just one.Like other sectors disrupted by the latest wave of innovation, the oil industry is facing radical changes in terms of job losses and transformed employment patterns. “It’s going to be uncomfortable for a while,” Mr Rogers says.Realising the full potential of the new technologies will mean bringing in more people with skills in software and data science. It will also mean overhauling corporate structures. “There’s a lot of problems still to be solved,” says Kausar Qazilbash of Accenture. “It’s not simple: it’s a massive shift in management that requires technological change and operational change.”If it can be accomplished successfully, the adoption of the new digital techniques will help defend oil and gas against the growing threat from renewable energy, battery storage and electric vehicles. Those new energy technologies are rapidly improving efficiency and cutting costs. But their old rivals in fossil fuels are not standing still.“We are just scratching the surface of what can be done with artificial intelligence,” says Mr Mathew at Baker Hughes. “This is one of those uses that will change the world.”The oil and gas industry is beginning to adopt new techniques made possible by modern computers that can store and process large and complex data sets. Often these techniques will employ “machine learning”, a form of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to draw conclusions by studying large data sets. The applications include:Seismic analysisBuilding a picture of rock formations and the location of oil and gas miles below the surface using seismic and other surveys is a highly complex operation. Powerful computers enable companies to understand more about the geology of regions that are difficult to observe, and to predict more accurately where oil can be found.Production optimisationThe flow of oil from a reservoir depends on a complex range of factors including the length and spacing of the wells and the types of fracturing used. Modern techniques allow companies to maximise the value from a field, sometimes throttling back initial production to achieve a higher ultimate return.Predictive maintenanceStudying all the data associated with pieces of equipment such as pumps and valves can give indications as to when they are likely to fail, allowing them to be repaired or replaced before they break. The result is better safety and an ability to streamline maintenance schedules.AutomationThe spread of intelligent and connected devices means that processes that traditionally needed skilled staff at a wellhead or processing plant can increasingly be run remotely. The result will be lower labour costs, greater safety with fewer workers in hazardous environments, and increased efficiency.SecurityThe energy industry is already a prime target for cyber attacks, such as the Shamoon and Shamoon 2 viruses that hit Saudi Aramco in 2012 and 2016. Increased mobile connectivity, the greater use of operational data and automation create new vulnerabilities, and oil companies need to deploy the most advanced technology to protect themselves."
15;ACN;Accenture Plc;2018-01-18T04:00:40Z;How firms fared in the UK’s Leading Management Consultants;Big names make the podium in more categories but niche rivals win ‘gold’ in their fields;"Every four years, the Olympic Games offer the spectacle of the world’s nations going head to head in a titanic contest for the most prestigious honours in sport: not just the podium positions but also the bragging rights afforded by topping the medals table.As in sport, so in consulting, except in one important regard. Consulting, unlike the Olympics, is about the winning, not the taking part. So which is the best consultancy in the UK, based on the views of peers and clients?For the UK’s Leading Management Consultants 2018, Statista, the research and data provider, sorted recommendations into three categories. Six stars were awarded to firms “very frequently recommended” in a consulting service or sector, five for “frequently recommended” and four for “recommended”. Let us call these the gold, silver and bronze “medals” in each “event”. Deloitte, KPMG and McKinsey top the table by total number of medals — they each won star ratings in 29 sectors and services, the maximum.This version of the table tells a familiar story: there is a gap between the largest, universal consultancies and the rest. Recommendations were made in at least 21 of the categories for the Big Four accountancy firms (Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and EY), the Big Three traditional strategy consultancies (McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Bain) and Accenture.But this is only one way of arranging a medals table. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, for instance, Team GB won fewer medals overall than China, but beat China in the ranking by number of gold medals.If one cuts the consulting medal tally in a similar way, it reveals a different picture: Accenture comes top. Despite gaining no medal ratings in two categories, it achieved 18 six-star ratings overall, against KPMG’s 17, Deloitte’s 12 and McKinsey’s 11. This table also elevates IBM to equal fifth with PwC, for its nine “golds”.There is more to this than meets the eye. The Management Consultancies Association — a trade body whose members include Deloitte, KPMG and PwC — pointed out in its recent analysis of UK industry data that in 2016, the largest firms grew by 4 per cent on average. Medium-sized firms did better, growing by 6 per cent, and specialists’ growth exceeded 20 per cent.A similar story is told by our ranking. On overall medal tally, there is a notable gap between Bain (which garnered 21 six-, five- or four-star ratings) and the next highest groups, IBM (14) and AT Kearney and PA Consulting (13 each).But the alternative view shows it is possible for specialists to win gold in single events. For example, Atkins Global topped the podium in the construction and infrastructure sector. OC&C was among the gold medallists in consumer goods and retail, and BAE destroyed all-comers in defence. Hay Group, part of Korn Ferry, the executive search firm, since 2015, wins gold in its specialist area of people and performance.These companies join Oliver Wyman, Baringa and Simon-Kucher in a cluster of seven consultancies that won the top ranking in one sector or service. In this analysis of the ranking, they jump above AT Kearney and PA, which achieved no six-star ratings.Some distinct subsidiaries of the biggest companies are winning recommendations, often by specialising, for example QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s data analytics arm.If anything, the ranking may overstate the importance of the bigger groups, whose balance sheets buy a lot of name recognition.What an at-a-glance analysis of the table does suggest is that trying to be all things to all clients is probably futile unless you are one of the largest consultancies. On the other hand, a strategy of smart specialisation could pay off. After all, if you are a small nation that is home to the world’s best weightlifters, why try to beat the USA in the track and field events?* Appearances in 29 rankings* Gold = very frequently recommended; silver = frequently recommended; bronze = recommended"
16;ACN;Accenture Plc;2018-01-18T04:00:28Z;Tech drives financial sector consultancy in the post-crisis era;Helping banks adapt to disruptive change accounts for a growing share of activity;The post-crisis crackdown by watchdogs imposed severe pain on all but one area of the financial services industry: the consultants whose regulatory divisions enjoyed a golden decade helping banks and other clients to keep pace with ever-changing demands.However, experts in the finer points of capital requirements and anti-money laundering protocols could soon be unseated as the superstars of their firms. “We’re getting to the end of some very important regulatory works,” says Philippe Morel, senior partner at Boston Consulting Group’s London practice, who believes “regulatory-driven consulting work should slow down” in the coming years.Luckily for firms such as BCG, they have blossoming fintech practices to fall back on. Start-ups have helped to drive innovation in areas such as foreign exchange, mobile payments and personalised insurance, and customers have become accustomed to better and cheaper services.Financial institutions are turning to consultants to help meet these demands, by using data scientists to harness customer information, app designers to create interfaces and systems experts to untangle expensive, outdated infrastructure.“We’ve recruited more than 1,000 specialised consultants across BCG working on topics which didn’t exist just five years ago,” says Mr Morel. They are technologists, data scientists and process specialists who help banks decide what to prioritise and how to design and implement solutions. Most of those newcomers work in financial services, including 100 who work with UK institutions.Technology is now so central that Accenture — whose roots are firmly in IT — has become highly regarded by UK financial services companies. It was “very frequently recommended” for financial institutions and services in the rating of the UK’s Leading Management Consultants compiled by the FT and Statista.“A lot of our clients do have a fair chunk of in-house [technology] capacity,” says Andrew Poppleton, Accenture’s head of financial services for the UK and Ireland. “What they value from organisations like ours are people who can look at what is working in other industries and bring it to financial institutions, or people [with] more recent technology experience.”Among clients “there’s been a shift from traditional advisory-based consulting to more engineering-led consulting”, he adds. “Architects, people who can really understand how the banks’ technology stacks [IT systems] work, are gold dust”.To help maintain its cutting edge, Accenture has invested heavily in research facilities such as The Dock in Dublin, where more than 200 designers, developers and industry experts work on innovation and collaborate with clients across the consultancy’s practice.The “Big Four” professional services firms KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC — which started out as auditing and accountancy practices and have long histories in consulting — are also reorienting their services to cater for clients’ demands.“We do recognise and see that technology . . . underpins much of financial services,” says Deloitte partner David Myers. The consultancy aims to “own and operate across” the full range of technology work in the sector, from conception to strategy and delivery, he says. Technology is the fastest growing part of Deloitte’s UK financial services practice, which has expanded to about 1,000 staff.Tim Howarth, partner at KPMG, says advising banks on how to harness new technologies is one of the financial services practice’s biggest areas of work, the others being regulation and cost. “Banks are looking for us to bring the ‘best in breed’ to them,” he says, adding that cyber security was a hot topic.Mr Howarth and Mr Myers say regulatory work remains relevant. Mr Howarth says UK clients continue to plan for EU regulation as if it will apply after Brexit.Mr Myers says that several changes are due to come into force this year led by investor protection rules Mifid II, which went live on January 3, and work around them will last much longer.“We’re going to have to still work through a fair amount of process and technology issues,” he says, adding that there was a “lot of clean-up” in the US after the Dodd-Frank banking regulations came into force.Another “financial and risk” income stream for consultants is advising on the fallout from Brexit. KPMG is so confident of the prospects for its UK financial services consulting division that it is recruiting 210 more staff into it. This is on top of 1,300 UK-based financial services consultants and 300 support staff in India.Some in the sector say consultants will not always have it so good. “I don’t think it’s the case that they are demonstrably offering more wisdom now than before,” says the chief financial officer of a UK bank. He attributes current spending levels to a mixture of regulatory work, the high volume of projects which banks cannot handle internally and the fact that banks cannot retrain staff fast enough to deal with change.“Collectively, consultancy firms have got themselves into the right place at the right time,” he says.
17;ACN;Accenture Plc;2018-01-08T05:00:30Z;Beyond lithium — the search for a better battery;Graphene and salt water offer promising advances;As the world’s power needs grow, the search is on for better battery technology — not just to keep smartphones charged for longer, but to run electric cars and to store energy produced by solar and wind power.For the last 25 years, the lithium-ion battery, has held sway. Packing a large amount of energy into a relatively small space and weight, these are in greater demand than ever for mobile phones and electric cars. In fact, 2017 has been, in the words of HSBC’s Paul Bloxham, a nirvana for lithium. The price of the commodity has been driven 240 per cent higher. Batteries accounted for 35 per cent of lithium use in 2015, up from 25 per cent in 2007, with electric vehicles, phones and personal computers accounting for 60 per cent of that market.Lithium-ion’s limitations are apparent, however, to anyone who has seen their mobile phone battery draining suddenly. There is a growing interest in finding alternative technologies.“There’s a sense that existing lithium-ion batteries and related charging technologies are reaching their limitations,” said CCS Insight, the research company.Samsung in November revealed that it had developed a technology based on a “ graphene ball” that could potentially boost its battery capacity by 45 per cent and increase charging speed five-fold. Keen to put behind it the memories of the exploding batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 phone, Samsung has been putting a lot of effort into battery research, and news that the graphene-based power unit would take just 12 minutes to be fully charged was welcomed by many.Yet the technology, similar to Qualcomm’s Quick Charge system, really only represents an enhancement, rather than a replacement, for lithium-ion.Graphene has long been seen as a vital ingredient for future energy needs. Other alternatives being researched include fuel cells, photosynthesis, solid state technologies, sodium-ion, solar, foam, aluminium graphite, sand and even human skin. Many of these have the advantage of being either safer or more abundant than lithium, the production of which is dominated by a handful of companies.However, research in these technologies largely remains in the labs with little sign of a full commercialisation on the horizon. Hydrogen fuel cells, first invented in the 1830s, have long been seen as the most viable alternative to lithium batteries. Yet the technology has been held back by high material costs since the 1990s heyday of hydrogen development. There has been some headway in harnessing hydrogen as an alternative power source but the ultimate aim is to use fuel cells to overhaul the transport market. Japan is leading the way with Toyota and Honda both pushing to develop the technology.Yet it remains a tough task. Intelligent Energy, a UK fuel cell company linked with developing the technology for use in smartphones, was quietly sold in October to one of its investors after admitting that a sales collapse risked leaving shareholders with little, or no, value.We asked readers, researchers and FT journalists to submit ideas with the potential to change the world. A panel of judges selected the 50 ideas worth looking at in more detail. This second tranche of 10 ideas (listed below) is about meeting growing needs for energy and resources. The next 10 ideas, looking at ways to change education and information management, will be published on February 5, 2018.One area where there is a pressing need for battery innovation is in the emerging market for wearable technology. A rigid battery would not work in emerging areas such as smart clothing so academics have been developing more flexible models. Researchers at the University of Manchester in August revealed that they had developed technology using graphene-oxide to create an ink-like substance that can be printed on to fabrics. The ink, which is as flexible as cotton, acts as a solid-state flexible supercapacitor that can rapidly charge electronic components.Dr Nazmul Karim, a fellow at the National Graphene Institute, said the breakthrough was a significant step in the development of new types of charging. “It will open up possibilities of making an environmental friendly and cost-effective smart e-textile that can store energy and monitor human activity and physiological condition at the same time,” he said.One Dutch company, meanwhile, has created a sustainable battery using only water and salt. AquaBattery has developed a system that involves brackish water flowing through a stack of membranes to store energy. The first ‘Blue Battery’ pilot project began in November in the Dutch city of Delft to prove that the system, which converts electrical energy into chemical energy, is as scalable as AquaBattery argues.Mei Nelissen, part of the team that initially worked on the Blue Battery concept, said in a Ted X talk that she was “dancing like we had discovered fire” when it proved the system could work, as it opened up the possibility of solving one of the main conundrums facing the renewable energy industry — storing energy for use when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.That remains the challenge for the battery market. Demand is growing exponentially in the here and now, particularly in the smartphone market where consumers are familiar with ‘red zone panic’ when their handset runs out of power.The Blue Battery won the ‘circular economy’ award from Accenture in October but the system remains a long way off commercialisation.Paul Lee, head of technology, media and telecoms research at Deloitte, says he does not expect change any time soon. “Over the next five years, lithium-ion is likely to remain the basis of almost all batteries used in smartphones. At present there appear to be no battery technologies on the horizon that have evolved sufficiently to be tested and factored into supply chains that could displace lithium ion.”This article has been amended to reflect the fact that although Mei Nelissen has worked on the Blue Battery concept she is not a co-founder of AquaBattery.
18;ACN;Accenture Plc;2017-10-26T03:01:33Z;Why I went back into the closet after university;Katie Kim feared her prospects would be worse if she were out;"By the time Katie Kim reached her final year at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, she was confident about her sexuality. Like many young LGBT people, she came out at college after what she calls a process of discovery. “I joined the women’s rugby team purely to meet other women, things like that.”Ms Kim was open about her relationships, mostly because she felt a sense of safety in numbers, and she was secure with her peers on a liberally minded campus. “It was very supportive,” she says. “I learnt how to come out in my own way. I was involved in Pride and LGBT issues.”Ms Kim’s confidence faltered after she graduated in 2012. With her degree in industrial and systems engineering, she visited the campus careers service and trawled graduate fairs looking to meet employers because she knew she wanted to be an analyst. But would corporate life mean hiding her sexuality?“It was a big question. I understood I was in a gay utopian bubble at college, but I wasn’t sure that would [be the case] at work with a big employer,” she says.So when she landed a job at Accenture, the professional services firm, Ms Kim, who was then 22, made the difficult decision to hide her sexuality from colleagues and clients. That decision turned out to be a problem for her wellbeing.Many young gay men and women hide their sexuality at work. According to a 2014 study by Human Rights Campaign, 35 per cent of LGBT employees feel compelled to lie about their personal lives while at work. “I’ve seen the figures and I completely understand it,” says Ms Kim.Her decision seemed rational at the time. In the absence of specialist LGBT advice on the university campus, she had turned to a friend of a friend to help her decide what to do — an older gay man with experience of working life.Her confidant advised her to keep her gay identity under wraps and focus on her job. He told her that if she were to come out, she risked handing “ammunition” to colleagues and clients who might use it to discriminate against her. “It didn’t go that great, and it shaped how things turned out for me,” she says. “I absolutely took it to heart.”Still fresh in her mind was the disquiet she had felt at college, when after revealing her sexuality a few members of her family had reacted badly. “So if my family were not on board, why would strangers at work accept me?” she says. “My job and my career were very important to me, so I thought: ‘You know what? I don’t want to deal with that right now.’“I’m also a woman, and I’m Asian-American. Why make it harder?”Hiding the fact that she had a girlfriend was surprisingly easy. “It didn’t come up, and I didn’t let it come up.” At the water cooler, she kept her answers ambiguous to questions about her social life and weekend.In the end, the evasion and pretence became a strain; she was weighed down by the cumulative denial. “I told myself it was important to be out at work: you don’t have to make it a big deal,” she says. “But being open about [being gay] matters 100 per cent. Work is about people and how you connect with them. It’s hard to really have that — otherwise we are all robots.”Read the OUTstanding LGBT executive and ally lists, presented by the FT, hereA chance conversation with Sander van ’t Noordende, group chief executive of products at Accenture, made her realise that coming out to colleagues and clients would not only be best for her welfare, it would be good for business.Mr van ’t Noordende is openly gay — and has been since he joined the firm in 1987 at the age of 24. “Until that conversation I didn’t even know she was in the closet,” he says. “But I understand — it’s not the smartest thing to say when you start a new job: ‘Hey guys! I’m the new gay in town!’”He explained to Ms Kim that being out would not only be easier for her, it was preferable because an authentic relationship with clients mattered. “I told him I felt stifled at work, and not brave,” says Ms Kim. “He advised me to just say it — drop it into conversation and people will figure it out. So I did.“We represent clients who are all different. Clients want to see diversity — that’s an advantage.”And their reaction? “Underwhelming,” she says. “To the point that it was obvious I should have done this earlier. I made it harder in my head than it actually was.”In the UK, Deloitte, the professional services firm, targets LGBT students before they apply for jobs. The company’s objective is simple, says Tom Kohler, co-chair of Globe, which is Deloitte’s LGBT network. “We don’t want to miss out on talent,” he says.The firm attends recruitment fairs and invites students to “insight days” as part of its recruitment work, and one of those days is aimed specifically at LGBT students.Mr Kohler, a director in Deloitte’s risk advisory practice, is open about his sexuality: “It shocks me that people go back into the closet when they start work. It disturbs me.”"
19;ACN;Accenture Plc;2017-09-26T04:00:26Z;Europe’s telecoms groups warn over regulation;Up to €100m a day lost to disruptive tech companies over the past decade, study says;The European telecoms sector has lost €100m a day to disruptive technology companies over the past decade, says a report commissioned by Etno, the trade body that represents the region’s largest operators.Europe’s telecoms groups have long complained about the burden of regulation on the sector, while more lightly regulated US and Asian tech companies have launched rival services offering communications and internet access — often using the infrastructure created by the national telecoms groups.The report, compiled by Accenture, warns regulatory change is required to create a competitive digital economy in Europe.“Europe could face further value loss to digital disrupters in other regions and over 50 per cent of current European jobs could be affected by digitisation,” it said.The report, released ahead of a Financial Times telecoms conference in Brussels on Wednesday, is the latest move by Europe’s largest telecoms companies to fight onerous rules that they argue act as a disincentive to investment.Executives in the telecoms sector also complain they are shackled by the fragmented nature of the regulatory environment in Europe, which has opened the door for technology companies to take a large share of consumer spending by offering free messaging, voice and other social media services.Under the current circumstances, European leadership in 5G is a pipe dreamAccording to Etno, European companies now account for only 11 per cent of global telecoms sector profit, down from 36 per cent in 2006.In 2008, the European average revenue per user (Arpu) from mobile phone calls was €14 per month, but this fell to €6.4 in 2016. Meanwhile, digital services increase demand for connectivity, especially on mobile devices. Overall, Arpus in the EU telco sector have declined from €44 each month in 2008 to €37 in 2016.The new report calculates that telecoms companies are investing to prepare for digital opportunities with capital expenditure as a proportion of revenue hitting 22 per cent at present, compared with an average 18 per cent historically.The ‘Lead or Lose’ report argues that telecoms companies could still be at the centre of a transformation of the economy that could create €4bn of value a day in the form of consumer benefits and business opportunities. But Europe first needs “decisive policy and industry action”, according to Accenture.The report argues that Europe needs to lead in strategic areas including internet of things technology and the development of pervasive high-speed networks using 5G and fibre. It also calls for the establishment of a common authority to manage unique personal identities and the safe use of new technologies including artificial intelligence.Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT, told the report’s authors: “My ability to predict 2030 is limited and yet, I am asking investors to commit to payback periods well beyond 2030. They need much more regulatory certainty to commit the funds required.”Michael Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, said: “Under the current circumstances, European leadership in 5G is a pipe dream. The investment capacity isn’t there today, and is unlikely to be there in the future without further consolidation in the mobile space.”
20;ACN;Accenture Plc;2017-07-16T09:49:47Z;How I lost my 25-year battle against corporate claptrap;The exponential rise of guff in business shows no sign of abating;"For nearly a quarter of a century, I have been writing columns telling business people to stop talking rot. For the same amount of time they have been taking no notice.The first example I can find comes from 1994 when I wrote an article mocking ugly business jargon, arguing that language had got so stupid that the pendulum must soon swing back and plain talking about business would shortly reassert itself. The words I objected to back then? Global, downsize, marketplace and worst of all, the mathematically nonsensical “110 per cent committed”.What an innocent age that was.Fast forward to July 2017, and an entrepreneur sits down to write a blog post about his company. “We are focused 1,000,000% on positive, move forward, actionable efforts to help facilitate change.” When someone sent me this bilge last week, I read it and shrugged.Over the past two decades, two things have happened. Business bullshit has got a million per cent more bullshitty, and I’ve stopped predicting a correction in the marketplace. I’m 110 per cent sure there won’t be one.Not only has production risen in aggregate, the worst individual offenders have gone on surpassing themselves, oblivious to my attempts to shame them into stopping.Howard Schultz is a champion in the bullshit space. The Starbucks executive chairman has provided me with more material for columns than any other executive alive or dead. Yet he is still at it, and still out-doing himself. Earlier this year, he announced that the new Starbucks Roasteries were “delivering an immersive, ultra-premium, coffee-forward experience”.In this ultra-premium, jargon-forward twaddle, the only acceptable word is “an”. Mr Schultz has brewed up a blend of old and new jargon, the fashionable and the workaday, adding a special topping of his own. “Delivering” and “experience” are grim but not new. “Ultra-premium” is needless word inflation. “Immersive” is fashionable, though ill-advised if you are talking about scalding liquids. The innovation is “coffee-forward”. Sounds fantastic, but what is it?Guff-talkers will never change. Or rather, there is nothing candidly in my sightline that would suggest that good sense will resume going forwardQuite possibly Mr Schultz does not read the Financial Times and the people close to him who do read it desist from forwarding to him articles that mock how he speaks. But even if he had seen the columns, I doubt they would have made a jot of difference.The business world is divided into two kinds of people. There are those who talk tosh (the majority) and those who do not. The defining characteristic of dedicated tosh-talkers like Mr Schultz is they simply do not see a problem with it.And why should they? While I have spent decades getting steamed up about mere words he has been making a difference to the way half the world lives and drinks. It is largely thanks to him that we all wander around the streets carrying cardboard buckets of pale brown stuff that we slurp through plastic lids. Not only has Mr Schultz made this difference, he has made some money, too. About $3.1bn, in fact.Talking rot has not only done him no harm, I fear it may have helped him. The new “roasteries” have an exceptionally vulgar Willy Wonka-style decor with beans whizzing around in see-through pipes. When the style is all hype, the language needs to match.Over the years, Mr Schultz has consistently proved just how bad language serves business people well. So when an analyst asks if you are going to acquire anything, you can either say no, which is a bit too bald and clear, or you can say 34 words instead, as he did a few years ago: “I would say that we have enough to digest in the near-term, and there’s nothing candidly in our sightline that would suggest that we’re involved in engaging anything that we’re going to acquire.”Bingo. The audience will be so bored, you will never get called to account.FT.com will be compiling some of readers’ favourite Lucy Kellaway columns in the next week. Please nominate one, or several, in the comments section belowEven more impressively, he has shown the way in the upping of the emotional ante. Money can’t buy you love, but love can compensate for not much money. Thus, he recently sent an email to the 100,000 or so US staff, most of whom he has never met and many of whom earn about $10 an hour, with the sign-off “know that I send you my love and respect”.Guff-talkers will never change. Or rather, there is nothing candidly in my sightline that would suggest that good sense will resume going forward.But this doesn’t make my past few decades spent campaigning an unmitigated failure. The few people who don’t talk rot get vast pleasure in mocking those who do. These brave and simple few have been sending me examples over the years, some of which are reprinted below. I don’t love FT readers, but I do respect and thank all those who have furnished me with such riches.Over the past month, I have been rummaging through the collection of business bullshit that I have built up over the past couple of decades with a view to republishing some of the finest exhibits. But as I studied the archive it occurred to me that all languages have their own rules — and guff is no exception. Here, I reveal the top eight rules, along with some splendid examples of how to follow them.If the first principle of journalism is to simplify then exaggerate, so the first rule of guff is complicate then obfuscate.An HR manager running an off-site meeting showed how it was done last year by warning attendees to “be cognizant of the optics of your personal brand”. In other words: tuck your shirts in.Management consultants have been world class at touting for business this way, inventing problems and then offering to solve them.A decade ago, Accenture demonstrated how to turn the banal into the portentous: “With the rise of the multi-polar world, the task of finding and managing talent has become more complex, turbulent and contradictory.” Never mind that the world has only two poles, and that finding good people is no harder than ever, Accenture added value by subtracting sense.The interesting thing about obfuscating/complicating is that it can be done with only a couple of words.The best ever title of a research paper: Robustifying Learnability — a 2005 report from the Federal Reserve.In guff, all negatives are spun, so no one need take full blame for anything. Uber has done pioneering work in the past few months by producing language so ugly and boring that the audience can only respond by switching off.The company has variously admitted to having “underinvested in the driver experience” and being “in a reputational deficit”, in the hope that no one will notice it has screwed its drivers and its name is mud.Rule 2 is handy when companies sack people. The latest euphemism comes from an investment management company that recently described sackings as going “into the gym . . . inducing cell renewal and thus making the company fit for profitable growth”.Though horrible, this is nothing on how EY got rid of a number of partners by sending a message around saying “we look forward to strengthening our alumni network”.Not all companies get it right. In 2013, HSBC announced it would be “ demising” the roles of 942 relationship managers, forgetting that the whole point of a euphemism is that you take something horrid and make it sound better.HSBC took something bad (sacking people) and made it sound considerably worse, as if it was not only depriving people of their livelihoods but actually killing them.One of the charms of guff is its syntactic flexibility — all nouns can be verbs and vice versa. Oscar Munoz made great use of this rule when he talked of “ deplaning” a man who was manhandled roughly off one of his United aircraft in April.Other great examples of nerbing and vouning fill the archive: to cold towel; a global touch-base; to effort; to front-burnerize; to town hall; to potentiate; to future; to value add; to bonus well.But my favourite came from a manager who, in trying to draft a memo, said: “There must be a better way to language it.” He’s right. There must.It all started in 2003 when the late Jimmy Lee sent an email to everyone in his corporate finance department at JPMorgan, saying: “Call a client and tell them you love them. They won’t forget that you made this call.”In the years since then, Irene Rosenfeld of Kraft has described herself as the “CEO of Joy”, while John Cahill, global CEO of McCann Health, has said: “Doubling down on our humanness will be the magic in how we drive better outcomes.”When it comes to ratcheting up the emotion, millennials are particularly gifted. A twenty-something Estée Lauder employee was recently quoted in the Financial Times: “Senior leadership was ecstatic about the level of ideation that came from this session.” This, I fear, bodes ill for us all. Passion, it would seem, is no longer enough. Ecstasy is the next frontier.Over the years, Toyota has renamed the car a “sustainable mobility solution”; Amazon has called the book a “reading container”; Speedo has rebranded the swimming cap a “hair management system” and a Nestlé bottle of water has been described as an “affordable, portable lifestyle beverage”. This rule is the most baffling of the lot as there is no reason for it.Make up your own by stitching together two or more existing ones.The greatest ever example of this was Eversheds, a frumpy law firm, which in 2007, tried to appeal to young recruits by looking for “knowlivators, innovateers, performibutors, proactilopers, prioricators and winnomats” — the last being a particularly unwinning combination of winners and diplomats.Rick Hamada, CEO of Avnet, is a master at this: “Drilling down one more click on services, we actually think of multiple swim lanes of opportunity around business.” However, he is not quite as good as the following management consultant: “You have to appreciate that the milestones we have set in these swim lanes provide a road map for this flow chart. When we get to toll gates, we’ll assess where you sit in the waterfall . . . ”The most lethal new language is not a mass of robustifying learnability. It is simpler but no less confusing.You use short, well-known words, but the catch is you use them to mean something different. The word of the moment is “play”.Strategy consultants pose the questions to gormless clients: Where to play? How to win? And fashionable business people refer to working activities as playbooks and playlists. On the lips of guff speakers, play does not mean play. It means work.The most gifted guff giants don’t use all the rules, but pick the ones that suit them best. My following three eternal favourites are great in different ways, but all deserve prizes: I am medalling (nerb) all of them.Bronze goes to Rob Stone, co-CEO of advertising agency Cornerstone, for heroically mixing cliché, metaphor and hot air to say nothing: “As brands build out a world footprint, they look for the no-holds-barred global POV that’s always been part of our wheelhouse.”Silver belongs to Angela Ahrendts who, in a Burberry annual report, wrote the most mysterious sentence ever composed in the English language: “In the wholesale channel, Burberry exited doors not aligned with brand status and invested in presentation through both enhanced assortments and dedicated, customised real estate in key doors.”I have showed it to many business experts over the years, but no one has ever been able to say what it means or explain why a raincoat maker could be talking so intently about doors.The runaway winner and deserved gold medallist is John Chambers who, while CEO of Cisco, fired off an email to underlings beginning “Team”, and ending: “We’ll wake the world up and move the planet a little closer to the future.”He has used plain words and simple syntax to produce the most terrifying piece of bullshit ever.In the four years since he said that the planet seems to have been reaching the future quite happily on its own, without the assistance of Mr Chambers or anyone else at Cisco.lucy.kellaway@ft.com

21;ACN;Accenture Plc;2017-05-10T04:00:33Z;The curse of the consultants is spreading fast;What was a niche for firms such as McKinsey has turned into a management industry;Warren Buffett will go to great lengths to stop Berkshire Hathaway using consultants. “If the board hires a compensation consultant after I’m gone, I will come back,” he promised its annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. It was a joke, but from the heart.Mr Buffett’s low opinion of overpaid hedge fund managers, whom he describes as “compensated on the basis of something that in aggregate cannot be true”, is well known. He extends that scepticism to other intermediaries — investment bankers, brokers, and consultants of every kind.It makes him highly unusual, since the corporate world is heading in the opposite direction. Everywhere one looks, there are more and more consultants — on strategy, investment, operations, compensation, digital transformation, technology, marketing. Some businesses seem to have been entirely occupied by consultants.What was a niche for a handful of wizards in firms such as McKinsey & Co and Boston Consulting Group has turned into a thriving industry that keeps on growing faster than many of its clients. Consultants now do many jobs that companies once performed themselves.Global revenues of management consulting firms grew 7 per cent last year to $133bn, according to Source Global Research. Some top firms, such as Bain & Co, are enjoying double-digit expansion, and have for several years. The large accounting firms, which mostly left consulting in the early 2000s, are back: 44 per cent of EY’s revenues last year came from advisory work.Consultancy is at the heart of professional services: of 2.2m people who work in financial and related professional services in the UK, 477,000 are consultants, compared with 421,000 bankers, according to the City UK trade group. What is going on?One answer is that they are needed. Many companies shed employees and retreated to their core after the 2008 financial crisis, outsourcing activities from manufacturing to technology. Hiring expertise as required — management as a cloud service — is a natural next step.Technological change is also a boon for consultants. The rise of digital technology and data analytics is upending many industries, including retailing and media. Companies wanting to remake how they operate have turned to consulting firms, particularly larger ones with tech expertise.That can mean everything from how a company collects and analyses data to how it advertises products to consumers through Facebook and delivers them to their homes. Marketing companies such as WPP and Publicis compete with digital divisions of consulting firms such as Accenture.These changes have serious implications for the nature of the company itself. A generation ago, the chief competitive advantage of US corporations such as General Electric and Procter & Gamble was management. They trained cadres of executives to run operating subsidiaries smoothly.Consulting offers a substitute — the ability for companies to outsource chunks of strategy and operations. It begs the question of what a large consumer goods company, for example, does. If trends continue, it could soon amount to a few managers overseeing consultants and contractors.Even for those that do not go that far, using consultants has attractions. It offers flexible use of a well-trained group of managers and professionals — the top echelon of what Accenture calls the “liquid workforce”. Hiring consultants who have undertaken similar projects elsewhere is reliable and fast.But there are dangers, which can be overlooked amid the rush. One is that companies are buying off-the-shelf solutions that make them operate more like others. They are being sold similar ideas and similar methods for reaching customers. The curse of the consultants is that anyone can hire them, so their ideas soon spread.It is a version of the conformity problem in asset management so scorned by Mr Buffett — originality is very difficult to come by. Berkshire is deliberately eccentric and obstinately operating in its own way has produced enormous rewards. As he wrote in his 2014 shareholder letter, “there are worse things in life than having a prosperous business one understands well”.The second danger is that consultants become a habit — once they get inside the building, they are hard to eradicate. They have an interest in keeping the relationship going, either by persuading clients that the challenges are complex, or by selling them more services.A company that needs a few tasks done quickly can become enmeshed. Many US corporations have “an expensive bureaucratic culture internally while a growing corps of financial advisers bids to sell shareholders a wide range of costly services”, writes Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University.Consultants are alluring in a world of changing technology and regulation, as their growth shows. But it is also wise for the buyer to beware of what they offer. One thing we do know: if Berkshire ever joins the bandwagon, Mr Buffett will turn in his grave.john.gapper@ft.com
22;ACN;Accenture Plc;2017-02-27T05:01:44Z;Phonemakers at Mobile World Congress pin hopes on 5G;Equipment makers may find it hard to deliver on new network’s utopian promise;Barcelona in late February is a hunting ground for pickpockets, for it is there that members of the telecoms industry annually convene to show off their latest wares, some of which still have yet to be announced.About 100,000 people will attend Mobile World Congress this year. Delegates will come from all sectors of the industry, including makers of the base stations that transmit phone signals, producers of the mobile devices that receive them and developers who make the apps that phones depend on.High on the industry agenda is 5G, a network technology that aims to make data communication speeds significantly faster than its predecessor, 4G. Mats Granryd, director-general of the industry body GSMA, which organises the conference, says: “We will move away from being vague on the prospects of 5G this year to concrete proposals.”There could be up to 200 launches of so-called 5G-lite by carriers this year as they prepare for its arrival in 2019.The coming of a faster network has been hailed as a possible boost for the telecoms sector, with Asian, US and European governments vying to take a lead in the new technology.A survey from UK telecoms company O2 predicts national 5G coverage would directly contribute an additional £7bn a year to Britain’s economy by 2026 and that the economic impact will be felt almost twice as quickly as that of fibre broadband, first tested by BT in 2009.Network equipment makers at Mobile World Congress will try to deliver on the promise of a fully digital and constantly connected society. But the utopian vision of 5G has led some to question whether it will deliver all the services and economic benefits being promised, particularly as squeezed telecoms companies are as yet unwilling to stump up the projected funds to build the networks. These could cost €56bn in Europe alone.Growing acceptance of services powered by artificial intelligence, such as voice assistants, is also fuelling this market upswingOne analyst quipped in the conference run-up that no network technology has been so talked about so early in the cycle. “That might be because there isn’t much else to talk about,” he says.Nokia will get in on the 5G act as the network equipment maker vies with Ericsson and Huawei to win orders for the new technology. However, the Nokia brand will also return to the consumer smartphone market for the first time in three and the half years since Microsoft bought its handset business.Some are confident the new Android-based range — made by Finnish company HMD — will become a force to reckon with. New BlackBerry devices, made under licence by third parties, will also come to market, despite the Canadian company signalling it would exit the sector last year. Others think Samsung’s woes with its exploding Galaxy Note 7 last year could let them in. Hopefuls include second-tier makers LG with its G6, and Huawei with its P10.93Number of countries that have mobile money usersSuch products could attract hungry buyers. Professional services group Accenture, which surveyed 26,000 consumers worldwide, found 54 per cent planned to buy a new smartphone this year, with especially high numbers of possible customers in India and China.That is welcome news for a market in which growth in 2016 slowed to 5 per cent from the 14 per cent posted a year before, according to research company Gartner. It also puts pressure on device makers to swim against the tide of what CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood calls the “sea of sameness”. As the Android software operating system underpins 82 per cent of smartphones sold, differentiation is difficult.David Sovie, global managing director for Accenture’s electronics and high-tech business unit, says features such as voice control should help sales. “Growing acceptance of services powered by artificial intelligence, such as voice assistants, is also fuelling this market upswing,” he says.The coming of 5G is likely to be the dominant conference talking point, even though the reality for many people around the world is that such a debate masks a daily struggle to get any sort of connection at all. Telecoms companies have started to discuss solutions, such as flying drones, or helikites, being deployed in remote areas of developed countries to deliver mobile broadband to spots land-based masts cannot reach.£7bnAmount O2 says 5G could add to UK’s economy by 2026It is yet to be seen whether those people who object to brutalist mobile phone masts spoiling the countryside will welcome War of the Worlds-style drones, or if the promise of blanket coverage will be enough to keep complainers quiet.The problem is more acute in the developing world, where connecting the unconnected remains a perennial difficulty. Facebook’s plans to deliver broadband across Africa suffered a setback last year when the SpaceX rocket carrying its $200m satellite exploded on the launch pad. The failure showed that delivering the latest in telecoms infrastructure is both expensive and tricky.Paul Lee, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at professional services provider Deloitte, says: “The world is getting more connected, but there are still billions to connect. Mobile connections are approaching the 5bn mark. So there are still over 2bn to go. There are also varying degrees of quality of connectivity. There are some 200 carriers yet to launch 4G services, but we are likely to see some operators launch 5G services this year.”This is not just a problem in remote places. More than 1m UK homes and businesses have what are deemed to be slow broadband access speeds, while 4G coverage is patchy even in cities. According to data from OpenSignal, a wireless company, the UK, once a pioneer in the mobile industry, now ranks 54th in global rankings of 4G coverage. “There is massive variation in mobile speed,” says Deloitte’s Mr Lee.The GSMA’s Mr Granryd argues that pushing mobile data to more places is the “nuclear reactor” for improving people’s lives. The demand for portable “electronic money” so people can use phones to withdraw or transfer funds, for instance, has strongly taken hold in emerging markets where many have not had access to traditional banks. These have caught up with contactless wave-and-pay technologies available to bank card and phone users in countries such as the US and UK. There are about 500m mobile money users across 93 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia.Christophe Uzureau, vice-president of banking and investment services at Gartner, says mobile finance has evolved rapidly. Different models have emerged but the most advanced, such as Alibaba’s Alipay in China, have added benefits, like assisting Chinese tourists with the processing of international payments. This evolution goes hand-in-hand with improved connectivity.The advent of 5G could accelerate development of digital services. But the GSMA says the industry also has to focus on the provision of more relevant local content if mobile is to blossom. As Mr Granryd points out, only 0.1 per cent of India’s web pages are in Hindi while more than 400m people speak the language. Hauling up masts alone will not be enough to make 5G a global success.
23;ACN;Accenture Plc;2017-02-14T12:23:36Z;Bank of Tech poses growing threat to traditional institutions;Facebook, Amazon, Alipay and others cut out banks in providing payment services;Last October, the Central Bank of Ireland added an unexpected company to its roster of digital payment providers — Facebook Payments International Limited. The licence it granted authorised Facebook to provide basic financial services, such as electronic money transfers, to all citizens of the EU.The social media giant already enables users to send money to each other in its Messenger app, and reportedly will soon add remittances to businesses. The company has acknowledged the Irish licence, but declined to comment on its future plans in this area.But all the signs are that big tech groups are working to cut out banks as the middlemen, threatening to turn legacy financial institutions into the dumb pipes that feed the back-end infrastructure to the consumer-facing Banks of Amazon, Google or Facebook.“The days where a single channel for financial services was controlled by banks are coming to an end,” said David Parker, head of banking at Accenture UK and Ireland. “Companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and many others who have much more intimacy with their customers will be able to demand and create better services.“In the short term, this will be the equivalent of small fish nibbling away at parts of a bank’s services, but in the longer-term, most banks are worried,” said Mr Parker. “It will become attractive for tech firms to pick off parts of the bank — Amazon lending to small merchants, Google putting a buy button in its adverts, Facebook facilitating money transfers, just as we started seeing with PayPal.”There is a challenge from the east as well. Earlier this year, Ant Financial — Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s digital payments arm and China’s largest online payments company — quietly applied for an e-money licence in the UK in its drive to expand internationally.The $60bn company already has more than 500m users, processes about 250m transactions a day and has received or applied for payment or banking licences in India, South Korea, Hong Kong and other Asian markets.If granted, its UK licence — allowing it to provide financial services that include issuing electronic money or granting loans under certain conditions — will apply to consumers across Europe.Amazon’s payment service is already advancing steadily: today, it allows online vendors on its Marketplace site to take payments across the US and Europe, and also makes small loans to merchants in the US, UK and Japan through its B2B arm, Amazon Lending. The division has made loans totaling over $1.5bn, with a total outstanding loan balance of $400m.In 2016, the e-commerce firm rolled out “Pay with Amazon” across France, Italy and Spain — a PayPal-like service that allows users to pay for non-Amazon purchases including government services, insurance and travel, using their Amazon login on thousands of third-party websites. In 2016, payment volume on this service nearly doubled and was used by 33m customers, Amazon said.Banks would be justified in feeling endangered by tech group’s inroads: in January, one in three global banking and insurance customers said they would switch their accounts to Google, Amazon or Facebook if they could, according to a new Accenture survey polling 32,715 people across 18 countries.Beyond customer disillusionment, the threat has gained an urgency because of an incoming piece of EU legislation, the second payment services directive (PSD2).The law, which will be rolled out next year, is designed to boost competition in the name of “open banking”, by forcing banks to allow third parties, such as Amazon or Facebook, to access the data of customers who authorise it.“This will allow tech companies to initiate payments to individuals and merchants direct from current accounts, bypassing card schemes. Also, they will be able to aggregate multiple bank statement data in a single place, with banks obliged to respond, provided the security has been authenticated,” said Chris McMillan, partner at management consultancy Oliver Wyman, which specialises in financial services.Some believe this is an existential threat to the banking sector, because of the dizzyingly high user numbers of companies such as Alibaba, Facebook and Amazon — and customers’ preference for the cheapest solution.“These large tech companies are coming at banks with massive scale — hundreds of millions, billions of loyal users. They could make basic services like transferring money internationally free overnight, as a way to grow loyalty and access ever more data,” said Mark Tluszcz, chief executive of Mangrove Capital Partners, a venture capital firm based in Luxembourg. “In the next three to five years, it wouldn’t surprise me to see large banks being bought up by tech companies.”Bankers themselves are predicting their new challengers may either shy away from competing with them because of the burden of regulation, or be weighed down by all the red tape.“Those new competitors . . . are also going to have to be faced with having to apply for a banking licence if they do banking and then absorb everything that comes with being a bank,” Sergio Ermotti, chief executive of UBS, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Accenture’s Mr Parker agrees: “[Tech companies] already make more money, are more profitable, so why move into a sector that has comparatively poor return on equity?” he asks.Ultimately, the way for banks to survive could be to piggyback on the consumer internet, rather than fight it. Already banks in Dubai, Turkey and South Africa are experimenting by opening up Facebook branches, or allowing users to swap instant messages with their bank manager via Messenger.“What percentage of bank revenues will come from payments and interchange in 10 years? My bet is it will be a lot smaller than today, because of online services like Ant Financial’s Alipay. That’s a fact of life for banks,” said Mr Parker. “They can either resist it or get on board and exploit it to sell additional services and products.”
24;ACN;Accenture Plc;2016-09-19T17:57:02Z;Accenture to unveil blockchain editing technique;Consultancy says prototype, aimed at financial services industry, will amend information stored;Accenture is courting controversy in the blockchain community by patenting a technique for editing information stored using the nascent technology in a move designed to make it more commercially viable.By allowing a central administrator to amend or delete information stored on a blockchain, the consultancy says that its prototype — to be unveiled on Tuesday — will make the technology more attractive to the financial services industry.However, to many diehard fans of the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency bitcoin, the move threatens one of its founding principles: that a blockchain should be an immutable ledger of events without the need for a central authority.Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms and cryptography created to allow bitcoins to be traded and verified electronically over a widely distributed network of computers without a central ledger.Having initially been sceptical about it because of worries over fraud, big banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets.Richard Lumb, global head of financial services at Accenture, told the Financial Times that financial institutions and regulators would need a means to quickly correct errors on the blockchain before using it in securities markets. He gave the example of a “fat finger” trading error, or a trade assigned to the wrong counterparty.This prototype allows you expunge a record completely and we think that will be needed by corporates and regulators“What we are talking about is adapting the blockchain to the corporate world and how do we make it pragmatic and useful for the financial services sector,” he said. “This prototype allows you expunge a record completely and we think that will be needed by corporates and regulators.”He drew a distinction between the need for an editing function on the invitation-only, “permissioned” blockchains that most banks are looking at establishing and the open, “permissionless” blockchains, such as bitcoin, where immutability is a key feature.Accenture and Giuseppe Ateniese, a professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, have filed a patent for their technology in the US and Europe. It uses a technique called the “chameleon hash” to add a type of padlock between units in a blockchain that allows an administrator with the key to unlock and edit them.Mr Lumb said the prototype would have provided a quick solution to the problem of how to recover the more than $50m stolen this year from the DAO, a crowdsourced venture capital fund using the Ether cryptocurrency.Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker running Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain specialist, has reviewed Accenture’s prototype. “Accenture’s approach is one of several options in the toolbox,” said Ms Masters. “But we think it is innovative and can strike the right balance between preserving blockchain’s key features and adapting it for real-world requirements within some permissioned systems.”After Mr Lumb wrote about the need to edit the blockchain in the New York Times last week, he has been criticised by several bitcoin supporters.Rocky wrote on the Crypto Hustle website: “The narrative of mutable private blockchains may be a symptom of financial institutions trying to use technology that was never built for them. In fact, the entire purpose of a blockchain is to circumvent those very institutions.”
25;ACN;Accenture Plc;2016-09-19T04:49:39Z;Results of foreign direct investments in Argentina remain flat;Foreign companies have promised to invest $30bn since Macri took over but only $1.3bn materialised in the first half of this year;"Whether it was their attempts to impound the presidential jet, the alleged harassment of her daughter or just the accusations of embezzlement and money-laundering, there is no question that Cristina Fernández de Kirchner developed a special kind of loathing for what she called “vulture funds”.So it was no surprise that Argentina’s former president should have been so disparaging of the new government’s success in ending an agonising legal dispute with US hedge funds. The hedge funds had sought repayment on bonds in default since 2001, which did more than perhaps any other single issue to destroy Argentina’s reputation among foreign investors.“They thought it would rain dollars after that agreement,” a scoffing Fernández told foreign journalists in July, poking fun at Mauricio Macri’s rosy forecasts during the 2015 presidential campaign that the floodgates of foreign investment would burst open were he to win.Certainly, the deal with the “holdout” bondholders was an essential part of the “normalisation” of Argentina’s economy so important for luring back investors. Currency and trade controls were also swiftly removed, and steps were taken to strengthen transparency, institutions and political dialogue in a bid to regain business confidence. The market responded with enthusiasm — bankers soon filled up flights to Buenos Aires and booked rooms at the city’s smartest hotels.Even so, some argue that the pace and magnitude of investment have been disappointing. There has been only a limited impact so far on the economy, which is expected to contract in 2016. A slow recovery could become a problem for the government if its supporters begin to lose patience as an austerity drive bites harder.“Dollars aren’t just going to fall from the sky. You have to do a lot of work,” says Mario Blejer, a former central bank governor who advised Daniel Scioli, Fernández’s chosen successor in last year’s elections. Nevertheless, he is “optimistic” that “definitely quite a lot of foreign investment” is heading Argentina’s way — especially, he says, if that includes as much as $400bn that Argentines have stashed in foreign bank accounts. Much of that is now expected to return to the country after congress approved a tax moratorium in June.“The opportunity [to invest] is there,” says Blejer, emphasising that after an investment drought of more than a decade there is a significant need for it. “There are signals that already some investment is coming in, but although there is quite a lot of renewal of old or obsolete capital stock, the point is that there is no new investment in big quantities.”Juan Procaccini, who leads the government’s newly created investment promotion agency, says many companies are still waiting to see “more control” over the economy, as the government battles to extinguish stubbornly high inflation at the same time as reactivating economic growth. “But others know [these problems] will be fixed [and therefore are investing already], especially those who are already here and know Argentina has changed,” he says.“This is moving very fast,” Procaccini continues, arguing that Argentina boasts the “perfect mix” of a new political cycle with a pro-investment government, diverse opportunities and a region where there is no major conflict. “Argentina was totally out of the equation for the last 10 years,” he says, adding that the country needs $25bn of investment a year just to “catch up” with levels in the rest of the region. While foreign direct investment in Latin America in the period since 2008 is about 4.5 times that in the 1990s, in Argentina it has remained largely flat, its share of total regional FDI plummeting drastically.Procaccini has identified more than $170bn worth of projects where the government is looking for investment across a range of sectors, including $75bn in infrastructure, with roads, railways and sewage systems the highest priorities. A further $75bn has been earmarked for energy and mining, especially in renewable energy and Argentina’s vast shale and lithium resources. Agribusiness is another source of high hope.Since Macri took power, a variety of companies have announced some $30bn in investments. They include carmakers such as Toyota, Renault-Nissan, GM and Fiat; energy companies ExxonMobil, Dow and Axion; miners First Quantum; Coca-Cola, Unilever and Procter & Gamble in the consumer goods sector; and financial services companies Santander, PwC and Accenture. However, in the first half of 2016 only $1.3bn entered the economy in the form of FDI, according to central bank figures.There is “enormous enthusiasm” about Argentina abroad, says Jorge Familiar, vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank. “We are very impressed by Argentina’s efforts. We want to accompany the country in this important moment,” says Familiar, who in July announced new investments in Argentina of $845m.I don’t think the boom many imagine is going to happen this year or even next yearBut many local companies, whose memories of Argentina’s past economic debacles are fresh, are circumspect about plunging money into the historically volatile economy. “Investment is going to be slower from the inside than from the outside,” admits one government official, who criticises local businesses as too slow to seize the opportunity: “Foreigners will get the first-mover advantage.”Joaquin Cottani, chief Latin America economist at rating agency Standard & Poor’s, identifies two particular areas of concern among investors: the fiscal deficit — long the bane of Argentina’s economy — and the exchange rate. Despite the devaluation after currency controls were removed in December, the peso has already lost competitiveness thanks to high inflation. “The exchange rate is still perhaps too strong to attract investment in many sectors, and the fiscal situation is not good,” says Cottani. “Those two things are working against the boom in investment that people anticipated when the new government was elected.”“So far we’ve only seen a ‘rain of dollars’ to finance the deficit of the government itself, and that’s because Argentina has been absent from international markets for so long, with all this pent-up demand from investors looking for returns,” adds Cottani. Indeed, between the national government, provinces and companies, Argentina issued $24bn in the first half of 2016, accounting for about a fifth of all emerging market debt issuance.The government is also expecting an influx of as much as $30bn when the tax amnesty starts to trigger the repatriation of Argentines’ funds abroad. The success of the whitewash could improve investment, but it will also present a challenge for the central bank, which has been struggling with flows of “hot money” as investors seek to take advantage of high domestic interest rates. “It’s not a lack of dollars that is the problem. Paradoxically, we have an excess of dollars,” says an official at the central bank, which under the new administration is focusing on tackling inflation, rather then seeking to control the exchange rate too.But Cottani, an Argentine who says he “optimistic” about Argentina’s prospects for attracting investment, argues that most businesses will wait on the sidelines to see what happens this year and what the outlook is for important midterm elections next year. “I don’t think the boom that many imagine is going to happen this year or even next year,” he says.Emilio Ilac, chief executive of Puente, an investment bank in Buenos Aires, says Argentina is “already the star emerging market”. He is convinced it will keep that status for the remainder of Macri’s term. His bank has been inundated by “hundreds” of funds seeking advice, many of which have never invested in the country that had been demoted to a “frontier market” during the Kirchner years. “When something is too good to be true it usually is — but this is Argentina,” he says."

27;ACN;Accenture Plc;2016-06-20T04:32:44Z;MoD set to privatise repatriation and burial of war casualties;Defence department has £19.95bn of contracts out to tender as it presses on with outsourcing;Repatriation and burial of war casualties and notification of next of kin are to be run by the private sector with the Ministry of Defence set to invite bids next month for a contract to run the services.Defence Business Services was established in 2011 to run human resources, payroll and vetting, and was merged with the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency in 2014.The division also provides welfare services to 900,000 veterans and their dependants. It issues 130,000 medals a year and manages the payroll and pensions for the MoD’s 50,000 civilian staff and 200,000 military personnel.A smaller contract to manage the organisation was held by Serco and Accenture until April. But the outsourcing deal is much larger and incorporates more MoD divisions, such as casualty services, which were not previously included, according to a pre-tender notice in the Official Journal of the EU.The deal is expected to include MoD staff in the division for the first time, with some of its 2,500 personnel expected to be transferred to the winning private company. The £36m four-year contract is expected to be awarded next year.It is the latest in a run of MoD outsourcing deals implemented as the UK’s defence budget has been cut by 8 per cent in real terms since 2010.Although defence spending is due to rise by about 5 per cent by 2020-21, the money will be soaked up by higher costs for existing programmes and new investments, such as the construction of four Trident missile-carrying submarines.Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS union, said its members were opposed to the DBS privatisation because of the “incredibly sensitive and important” nature of its remit.“We believe our armed forces and their families will be shocked and sickened to think this work — which is currently carried out compassionately and thoughtfully — could be handed to a private company to profit from.”The MoD said no final decisions had been made “so any detail of any potential future contract is speculation”.Other MoD services seeking private management for the first time include fire and rescue services for UK military at bases and airfields at home and overseas.A contract to run the Defence Fire Risk Management Organisation, which employs 2,200 staff at 78 defence fire stations worldwide, is due to be awarded in September, with a private company such as Serco or Babcock taking over operations next year.The MoD has become the biggest user of the private sector in central government, with £19.95bn of services out to tender, according to a 2013 National Audit Office report.This is well ahead of the next two biggest outsourcers — the Department for Work and Pensions at £3.45bn and the Ministry of Justice at £2.85bn — and will have increased substantially since the report after large-scale transfers in the past three years.The FT’s one-stop overview of key UK economic data and trendsVarious models have been used to involve the private sector. In 2014 the department sold the Defence Support Group, which employs 2,800 engineers responsible for maintaining the army’s vehicles, to Babcock for an upfront sum of £140m.In a more traditional outsourcing deal, 1,200-plus defence ministry employees were transferred to the US contractor Leidos last August, when the government handed responsibility for buying and distributing non-military essentials such as bandages and coffee in a 13-year deal.Not all the MoD’s attempts to privatise services have been successful. In 2014 it pulled out of a deal to part-privatise military procurement after one of the two bidders withdrew and there were protests from the US government.The MoD did not respond to a request for comment.
28;ACN;Accenture Plc;2016-06-09T18:15:40Z;Demand for digital services leaves banks open to more risk;Survey of bankers puts spotlight on data-handling concerns;Global banks are exposed to more risks from their new digital services than they are able to handle, according to a survey of senior bankers worldwide.The majority of top bankers — 76 per cent — “strongly agree” that they are open to more risks than they can manage as a result of digital developments, according to a global survey of 300 managers by consultancy Accenture.The findings reflect a growing anxiety that customer data becomes increasingly vulnerable as banks collaborate with other operators, such as fintech companies with sophisticated digital services.Some 85 per cent said that new digital products and services are putting data-handling concerns in the spotlight, exposing banks to “exponentially more risk”. But a further 85 per cent strongly agree that a lack of data security and ethical controls could exclude them from collaborating with other companies.“The more customers trust digital banking, the more banks introduce digital services — a dynamic that makes customer data increasingly vulnerable,” the report said.The concern comes amid a string of high profile cyber security failures after a number of banks were hit by hackers trying to siphon money. A Vietnamese bank was recently robbed by cyber criminals using similar methods to a data theft incident at Sony two years ago.Alan McIntyre, head of Accenture Banking said: “Banks have much work to do to reassure customers that their best interest is top of mind and their data are being handled ethically and securely.“The first step to securing ‘digital trust’ is to be transparent and clearly communicate what data are being collected and for what purpose, and then use that data for the primary purpose of offering customers benefits tied to the data being shared.”He added: “Banks want a balance between being close to innovation without jeopardising their reputation.”More banks are launching digital capabilities and collaborating with fintech companies to provide faster mobile-based services for customers to bank on-the-go.Santander UK, for example, has teamed up with US online lender Kabbage, in which it invests, to provide small business with funding in a matter of hours.Spanish bank BBVA has taken stakes in a number of banks, such as Simple in the US and Atom in the UK, which focus on mobile and digital services.The Accenture report said 52 per cent of bankers expect to be working with new digital partners within the industry over the next two years. It said that 42 per cent forecast working with companies outside of the banking industry.But customer data are also at risk of becoming exposed as regulation is prompting banks to open up access to third parties, in an attempt to boost competition and innovation in banking services.In Europe, the new payment services directive rules aim to make available account interactions and data so that third parties can initiate payments from customer accounts, with their permission.Simon Burrows a director at PwC, said while the regulation is ultimately positive, it “increases the risk of data issues and leaks where access isn’t as fully controlled as it should be, or where the boundary between different players’ responsibility is unclear”.

Investments in insurtech rose from $800m in 2014 to more than $2.6bn in 2015, according to data from Accenture, the management consultancy. While much of the money has come from traditional sources such as venture capital and private equity groups, established insurance companies have also been big investors.“We are seeing a growing focus from insurance companies on insurtech,” said John Cusano, head of Accenture’s global insurance practice. “They see it as a ripe place to invest their capital and they also see it strategically as a place to invest in distribution, the internet of things, automating the back office, and data and analytics.”Many of the world’s largest insurers, including Aviva, Axa, Allianz, AIG, MetLife and XL Catlin, have established their own in-house venture capital funds and insurers have committed more than $1bn to investments in start-ups in an effort to find new ways to grow and head off potentially disruptive threats.“There is an increasing view that insurance companies need to transform, become digital and make use of the technology, especially the big players,” said Mr Cusano.Deals completed last year included the acquisition of LearnVest, a financial planning provider, by Northwestern Mutual of the US and an investment in Limelight Health, a health insurance quote platform by MassMutual Ventures and Axa Strategic Ventures.The investment boom shows little sign of easing in 2016. According to data from CB Insights, the first quarter of the year was the second largest ever for investment in insurance technology with more than 45 deals raising $650m.The US took the lion’s share of the market in the first quarter with 60 per cent of the deals, including a $400m funding round for Oscar, a US health insurer.However, interest is also growing quickly elsewhere. At a start-up boot-camp event this month held in a church in London’s Spitalfields, 600 people turned up to see 10 insurance technology companies demonstrate their wares. They included Fitsense, which helps health insurance companies to use data from wearable devices, and SPIXII, which helps people to choose the right insurance cover.Instech London, an initiative to link start-ups, investors and insurers, has been attracting crowds of up to 250 people to its meetings.“We’ve got an awful lot of people coming along from the insurance industry who are trying to understand what is changing,” said Paolo Cuomo, co-founder of the group.

Accenture originally bought Duck Creek from venture capital investors in 2011.Apax’s investment will be used to develop cloud-based software to sell to insurers who are scrambling to analyse increasingly large sets of data for pricing risk.“Over the past five years, Duck Creek has evolved into a leading global software solution for top insurers,” Jason Wright, a partner at Apax, said.“Apax intends to build upon this success by supporting the current management team to accelerate innovation in partnership with Accenture and its significant digital and insurance domain expertise.”“We believe this joint venture will be a game changer in the insurance technology arena.”Apax, which started as a venture capitalist group in the 1980s but is now one of Europe’s biggest buyout groups with $38bn in funds, has invested $2.5bn of equity in technology companies since 2008.Its software investments have included Sophos, the data security supplier which listed in London last year at a market capitalisation of £1bn. The shares have fallen by a fifth in the year to date.$38bnTotal funds of Apax, which is now one of Europe’s biggest buyout groups“Apax’s record of investing in technologies that become category-leaders has made them an ideal partner in this venture,” said John Cusano, head of Accenture’s global insurance practice.The Duck Creek deal is the second joint venture that Apax has signed this year, after buying a majority stake in the respiratory business of BD, a medical technology company, in March.Private equity groups usually prefer to take complete control of their investments rather than engaging in joint ventures, but especially in Europe are increasingly resorting to other deal structures in response to a lack of classic buyout targets.Competition among private equity groups for these classic targets has remained high, driving up prices, despite a slowdown in buyout debt financing markets at the beginning of the year.By contrast, carving out unloved or capital-starved assets at big companies can often be cheaper and attract fewer rivals.
31;ACN;Accenture Plc;2016-04-11T23:01:45Z;Technology companies raise $1bn to challenge banks;Traditional lenders must learn how to collaborate with newcomers, says report;Technology companies raised almost $1bn of investment last year to compete with British banks, according to a new report.More than 90 per cent of the investment was going into financial technology companies that were direct challengers to traditional lenders, said Accenture, the consultancy firm.The trend in Britain stands in contrast with other countries, such as the US, where 83 per cent of investment went into fintech companies seeking to collaborate.“London in particular presents a welcoming regulatory environment for competitive ventures, making it a preferred market to test their propositions. But this is also a reflection of market maturity,” said Richard Lumb, head of financial services at Accenture.“While markets like the US have tilted toward collaborative ventures in recent years, Europe is earlier in the fintech development cycle and is likely to become more collaborative over time,” he added.Digital competitors in the UK such as TransferWise, which offers low-cost overseas money transfers, have emerged over the past few years to fill a gap left by the banks and fulfil customer needs.The report warned that banks risk losing “the battle for customer relevance” if they do not work with fintech companies and invest in technology.The problem for many traditional banks is that they are forced to spend significant resources supporting their existing technology platforms that are often decades old.Tim Levene, founder of Augmentum Capital, which invests in fintech, said: “Existing financial institutions will find themselves at the centre of this disruption with innovative consumer propositions that threaten their dissatisfied customer base.”Traditional financial companies are “often blighted by legacy problems with their systems, [and] are overwhelmed with regulatory and compliance challenges”, he said. “Many of the most talented innovators do not want to work within a traditional bank or an insurer.”“However, the industry is waking up to the challenge and is trying to embrace change,” he added.Atom Bank launched in Britain last week as the first mobile-focused operator in the UK. Mark Mullen, its chief executive, said Atom is aiming to “offer a genuine alternative to the insidious and self-interested banks that dominate the UK banking landscape”.BBVA, the Spanish bank, took a stake in Atom at the end of last year before it had launched, in a sign of traditional companies backing technology start-ups to keep abreast of digital innovation.The Accenture report showed there is still a low level of investment by banks. Last year, banks participated in less than 10 per cent of all reported fintech deals, totalling less than $5bn.Mr Lumb said: “Banks need to recognise this as an opportunity to engage and study the competitive fintech players.”Although Britain is the dominant fintech centre in Europe, Germany and France surpassed the UK’s investment growth rate last year, Accenture said.The British government announced on Monday the launch of an industry-led panel that aims to ensure the country stays at the fore of financial technology developments.
32;ACN;Accenture Plc;2016-03-23T14:44:19Z;Management makeovers bring in peer reviews for pay;Employers are replacing appraisals and ratings with ‘check ins’ and continuous feedback;"Dana Minbaeva does not know how her career appraisal will turn out this year — or whether it will even take place. Her organisation has freed team leaders to experiment before deciding whether to change its performance management.Appropriately enough, Prof Minbaeva studies appraisals and staff feedback for Copenhagen Business School.Hers is not the only employer tinkering with staff ratings and reviews. In the past three years, General Electric, Microsoft, Deloitte, Accenture and Cisco Systems are among many that have announced reform of, or actually reformed, their performance systems.Ratings are in the line of fire. Staff have long complained that they lead to a “rank and yank” process, where people rated lowest on a bell curve get forced out. In turn, that can drive team members into vicious competition with their colleagues. “People responsible for [software] features will openly sabotage other people’s efforts,” one Microsoft engineer told Vanity Fair in 2012. Microsoft ditched forced ranking a year later.When not toxic, ranking systems can be baffling. One team leader at a UK consultancy says he is asked to rate staff on three dimensions, “two of which I’ve frankly never understood, however many times I’ve discussed it with human resources.”If such crude rankings are dying, though, employers are still unclear what will replace them. They fret about how to gather enough information to decide on pay and promotion.The future of performance management as a whole is only slightly easier to predict, but the annual career appraisal is fast disappearing. Where it survives, it is transforming into a process of constant feedback. The inspiration, in many cases, is bottom-up “Agile” product development, in which progress towards goals is regularly reassessed.Ashley Goodall, who started to introduce a new system at Deloitte before moving to Cisco to lead a similar project, says companies are no longer asking: “Do you have five ratings or seven ratings on a scale, or annual reviews? They’re looking at the whole edifice”. For a while Cisco ran with no traditional process: “You can just stop doing it and it turns out that the sky doesn’t fall.”One reason for change is that form-filling and bell-curve-analysing are hugely inefficient. “We realised we were spending so many hours proposing a rating, debating a rating, communicating a rating, that we really didn’t spend time developing people,” says Mike Preston, Deloitte’s chief talent officer.Accenture’s chief executive set off a wave of approval last year when he said the consultancy would “get rid of 90 per cent of what we did in the past”. Its staff were spending 21 hours each, 8m hours in total every year, on performance management. Sixteen of those hours were devoted just to process.Deloitte’s US team leaders assess staff at the end of a project, or once a quarter, against four statements:
1. If it were my money, I would award this person the highest possible compensation increase and bonus (on a five-point scale, from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”).
2. I would always want him or her on my team (on a five-point scale).
3. This person is at risk for low performance (yes or no).
4. Based on what I know of this person’s performance, he or she is currently operating at the next level [ready for promotion] (yes or no).Mike Preston, Deloitte’s chief talent officer, says regular “check-ins”, frequent surveys and these four questions mean “it’s about getting better data to make decisions”.Companies are not, however, trying to recover all the wasted hours. They want to redeploy them. GE’s Janice Semper says the industrial group’s managers now devote more time to “coaching and pushing decision-making down in the organisation” — a big change from Jack Welch, then chief executive, urging them to draw a “vitality curve” and force out the worst-performing 10 per cent in any team.Reformers believe younger workers are happier measuring and updating performance and targets regularly using mobile apps than they are waiting 12 months. “Imagine if Fitbit [the wearable fitness tracker] only sent you an email at the end of the year,” argues Kris Duggan, founder of BetterWorks, which sells goal-setting software.In the programmes being rolled out at Deloitte and Cisco, based on an ap­proach developed by consultant Marcus Buckingham, managers use a combination of regular “check-ins”, backed up by instant staff engagement surveys and quarterly performance snapshots. GE calls its regular discussions “touchpoints”; its informal feedback sessions are known as “insights”.Transparency is another element common to the latest appraisal methods. Accenture, which hopes to have implemented a change for all 373,000 employees by midyear, asks teams to share strengths, agree priorities and adjust them based on open assessments of how the work is going.Companies are also trying to devolve responsibility for feedback and performance reviews to smaller units, in the belief peers are better at identifying laggards quickly and dealing with them.Accenture has a pilot scheme to delegate pay decisions to individual teams, some with as few as 30 members. “This was the area I was a little nervous about, because we don’t want rewards to bec­ome a free-for-all,” admits Ellyn Shook, the group’s chief leadership and human resources officer.Critics question whether the reforms are even focusing on the right problem, since the fact that humans love feedback and hate ratings is not exactly new. W Edwards Deming, the US management expert who revolutionised Japan­ese manufacturing quality, wrote in the 1980s that rating “nourishes short-term performance, annihilates long-term planning, builds fear, demolishes teamwork, nourishes rivalry and politics”.His followers believe companies should repair faulty ways of working, not obsess about individual performance, which is bound to vary. Formal ratings should be dropped, Kelly Allan, a consultant and adviser to The Deming Institute, says: “Once you hear you’re a three out of five you can’t hear anything else: your supervisor might as well be reciting poetry.”GE is collecting views from 30,000 staff who have been trying out a world without ratings. Ms Semper says there is “a lot of momentum” behind its new performance “conversations” and an understanding that ratings may detract from that process. Under GE’s approach, she believes team leaders will have more data with which to reward people appropriately. The same philosophy informs the Cisco and Deloitte programmes, which generate a scatter chart of team performance, rather than a single number, allowing managers to spot outliers and assess how individuals are doing more fairly and accurately.Old habits may be hard to kick, though. Accenture’s feedback shows team leaders still want a framework, which Ms Shook calls “guardrails”, to help them assign pay.Some team leaders, brought up on the old system, may resist the change. An HR executive at one big European company says managers set in the old ways simply use new continuous-feedback tools to record the traditional annual appraisal. Steve Hunt of SAP SuccessFactors, which supplies such tools, says one company had trouble restructuring staff after it ditched its rating system. “They ended up asking ‘Can we use compensation increases as a proxy [for individual performance]?’” he says. “That’s crazy.”Prof Minbaeva says that as long as performance management schemes fit corporate strategy and everyone agrees with them, their precise structure may not matter. She points out that Danish managers already use MUS, an acronym for the Danish word meaning “employee development conversation”. When they saw the multinationals’ reform plans, “they shrugged their shoulders and said: what’s new?” As for her business school’s experiments with performance management, “I wouldn’t be surprised if they come back with a system that’s only slightly different”.…What has been your best - or worst - experience with an employer assessing your work performance?

33;ACN;Accenture Plc;2016-02-17T14:00:14Z;Blythe Masters forges blockchain partnerships;Digital Asset Holdings agrees alliances Accenture, PwC and Broadridge;Blythe Masters, the investment banker turned blockchain entrepreneur, will on Wednesday announce a string of partnerships with consultancies to help their financial clients harness the technology that underpins bitcoin.Digital Asset Holdings, the New York start-up run by Ms Masters, has agreed alliances with Accenture, PwC and Broadridge to offer its blockchain technology to their consulting clients with a promise to save them money and time.Accenture is building on its partnership with the former JPMorgan Chase banker by also announcing the launch of a blockchain practice, which will advise clients on how to implement the technology.The moves highlight how the financial services sector is rushing to explore the potential of blockchain, the computer network on which bitcoin sits.The technology is based on a shared digital database that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records and is accessible by various parties. This means payment or trading ledgers can be instantly updated in multiple locations without a single, centralised authority.Ms Masters said Digital Asset’s technology “improves post-trade processing efficiency for banks and other financial institutions”. She added: “Instead of building countless duplicative records, one master prime record can eliminate the need for reconciliation, which is a very costly process for financial institutions, while improving compliance, security and privacy.”“Investment banks are spending about $100bn a year on technology, and the blockchain could take out about 10 to 20 per cent of that,” said Richard Lumb, chief executive of Accenture’s financial services operating group.“When you look at an industry that is down on its knees in terms of profitability, the blockchain offers some really valuable answers,” he added. “There is a market forming around the blockchain, and we don’t want to be left behind in that race.”While most regulators and senior bankers view bitcoin with suspicion, the technology that underpins it has caught the imagination of the financial services industry within the past year. A host of companies are vowing to find ways to use it to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading old back-office systems to automatic execution of contracts.Digital Asset recently announced it had raised $60m in funding from 15 financial institutions. Accenture was one investor, as were several big banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Santander and BNP Paribas.It has also agreed a deal with JPMorgan to look at several applications for the technology, such as addressing liquidity mismatches in JPMorgan’s loan funds, which normally let investors take out their money at short notice — even though the underlying assets can require much more time to sell.Several groups — including Digital Asset, JPMorgan and Accenture — have joined the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project, which launched recently to create open source standards for using blockchain to record and verify transactions for the whole financial services industry to adopt.
34;ACN;Accenture Plc;2016-01-31T22:30:57Z;MBA graduates’ love affair with consultancy endures;How do the ‘big three’ firms influence elite schools?;Google, Facebook and Amazon might grab more of the headlines, but consulting firms are still snapping up the most students at top business schools as they remain the largest recruiters, according to the latest MBA placement statistics.Amid a surge of interest in technology companies, consulting’s enduring appeal — particularly that of McKinsey, Boston Consulting and Bain, or the “big three” — comes at the expense of finance and banking, which are still recovering from recession.Recent surveys suggest little more than a third of those who enter consulting after graduation are still working in the field six to eight years later. However, MBA students continue to find attractive the high starting salaries — up to $145,000 a year — and the fast career progression offered by consulting firms.Still, some observers worry the influence of consulting is now so great that it may be influencing business schools to serve the needs of the profession.Among the schools to report placement statistics for their classes of 2015, Chicago Booth says the consulting sector has recruited 32 per cent of its MBAs, a rise of 4 per cent on last year and the first time consulting has come close at the school to toppling financial services.Consulting firms hired the most MBAs at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business in 2015 for the second consecutive year. More than a third of its MBAs this year have entered consulting, with the big three snapping up 18 per cent.“For the past few years, about a fifth of Tuck’s graduating students have gone to work for the big three consulting companies and this current recruiting cycle looks to continue that trend,” says Stephen Pidgeon, the school’s associate director for career development who joined McKinsey when he graduated from Tuck in 2007. “Consulting provides a very good match for the interests of MBA students in that it looks for intellectually curious people with a strong mix of hard and soft skills — a top business school is one of the best places to find a rich mix of these people.”Throughout the financial crisis, Harvard Business School has placed a steady quarter of its MBAs in consulting. And its appeal is not restricted to the US. Insead reported that consulting firms hired 41 per cent of its 1,011 MBAs in 2014, more than a quarter hired by the trio of top firms.A glance back at history suggests that in the early days of consulting it was the strategy firms that needed business schools to help legitimise their emerging profession. Now their influence spreads beyond recruitment. Joe O’Mahoney, senior lecturer at Cardiff Business School says several European schools, such as Grenoble and Cardiff, now run consulting modules. Others, such as UCD Smurfit, run MScs in management consulting while Lancaster invites Accenture consultants to teach on one of its MScs.However, Prof Sturdy says that even if these services are on an MBA curriculum, good business school academics are not afraid to subject them to significant critique. “Even the best consulting firms rely on correlation rather than causality when selling ideas,” he says. “This problem would come up in any research methods class.” Prof Sturdy argues that consulting firms could contribute further to MBA learning by discussing more practical examples, but thinks they are hindered by their need to be associated only with success.The top firms believe their relationship with schools is a win-win for both sides, but their lead recruiters are keen to stress their future as well as current recruitment needs. “We’d like MBAs to learn more about organisational dynamics and the science of decision-making,” explains Mel Wolfgang, head of global recruitment at BCG. “That would help clients absorb the work we do and change their decision-making for the better.”Brian Rolfes, director of global recruiting at McKinsey, says client work continues to expand outside traditional strategy consulting and into implementation, restructuring, transformation and digital. “Clients are also looking for more specialised experience so people with a MBA and experience in certain functions or industries are more important than ever,” he says.The mutual benefit has been most evident between McKinsey and Harvard Business School — so entwined that writer Martin Kihn coined the term McHarvard in House of Lies, his controversial book on consulting. Through its case study method, McKinsey helped bolster Harvard’s MBA, giving it real-world cachet. McKinsey still uses the case-based interview to recruit MBAs. “The case study method ingrains a consulting mindset on students from an early age,” says Andrew Sturdy, a management professor at Bristol University. “Harvard pioneered this method with the explicit support of McKinsey.”In his unauthorised biography of McKinsey, The Firm, business journalist Duff McDonald writes that when Harvard president Derek Bok proposed jettisoning case study methods in 1979, McKinsey chief executive Marvin Bower wrote a 52-page retort. The proposal was scrapped. In return, Harvard acted as a breeding ground for future McKinsey consultants who understood the firm long before they started working there.McKinsey became the first to focus on hiring business schools’ crème de la crème — at Harvard these were the Baker Scholars, the top 5 per cent of each class — prioritising youth and potential on the grounds that it was easier to mould a young mind. By the mid 1960s, at least two of every five McKinsey consultants had gone to Harvard. “The practice of hiring from top schools really took off when BCG started to compete with McKinsey for talent in the 1960s and 1970s,” says business journalist Walter Kiechel and author of Lords of Strategy, “and business schools had to demonstrate success in placing their students with the firms.”In recent years, the big three have widened their search to a broader range of business schools, but the bulk of recruits comes from elite schools: Harvard, Yale, Kellogg, Duke, Wharton, Chicaco Booth, Michigan Ross, MIT Sloan, Tuck, Darden, London and Insead. Being top employers puts them in a strong, some would say dominant, position at some schools. “Consulting firms use greater resources than many other employers can,” says Prof Sturdy. “Business schools are not always effective in regulating this and [it] can crowd out other options.”
35;ACN;Accenture Plc;2016-01-18T10:18:15Z;When CEOs have to be there — and when they do not;While Accenture’s boss now beams in by hologram, face-to-face meetings still count;From Paris, Pierre Nanterme recently made a presentation to staff near Chicago — through a hologram. It’s a nice trick if you can pull it off and it is one of which Accenture’s chief executive, who last week showed me a picture of the live presenter high-fiving his virtual image, is rather proud.Using Skype, telepresence (the video conferencing technology that gives participants the impression they are in the same room as distant colleagues or clients) and other tech tools, Mr Nanterme is able to boast that senior executives at the consulting group “don’t have physical meetings”.While this is a useful story to convince clients to pay Accenture to digitise their own processes, it is ragged with exceptions and contradictions.Mr Nanterme concedes that when the quality of the meeting is important, or it involves a visit to a client’s factory, or there are lots of participants, it may be better to meet in person. He is himself on his way to Davos for the ultimate face-to-face gathering of the chief executives’ tribe. The World Economic Forum is a unique occasion, he claims, echoing the justification of other participants.Another chief executive I met last week, Dev Ittycheria of MongoDB, a fast-growing database company, makes a similar boast about his ability to run the company remotely. But he is also convinced that talking to his managers, customers and investors in person makes a difference. “Sitting down with people face to face has a big influence on how that relationship develops,” he told me. His management team gets together in the same place at least once a month.The truth is that chief executives exaggerate both the power of their presence and the power of technology to stand in for them.For the few hundred corporate leaders who travel to the Swiss Alps each January, there are many tens of thousands, including Mr Ittycheria, who don’t think it is worth it. If Davos is not merely the ultimate festival of presenteeism (and it is that, too), the attraction must be that it is an occasion where the benefits of human interaction repay the cost and effort. Otherwise, why not simply line up competitors, customers and suppliers one after another in a telepresence booth?Sometimes, though, the looming presence of the chief executive is a drawback. David Potts, CEO of UK supermarket chain Morrisons, is a hands-on retailer, as comfortable on the shop floor as in the boardroom. He urges his senior managers to do regular stints helping in the shops, and leads by example. But he freely admits he can influence the stores better from the centre than from the shops themselves, confounding the tired idea that “the headquarters is where the chief executive is” (a mantra for both Mr Nanterme and Mr Ittycheria).Another pitfall for leaders is that incessant travel may cause them to burn out. Mr Ittycheria’s predecessor Max Schireson resigned with a widely circulated blogpost which explained that by flying 300,000 miles every year, he had “missed a lot of family fun”. Another reason the almost equally well-travelled Mr Ittycheria will not be at Davos is that he aims to maintain at least some semblance of balance between work and play.What ought to be obvious to even the most digitised chief executives is that face-to-face meetings still countTechnology is a wonderful enabler of certain tasks. Laku Chidambaram of the University of Oklahoma, who has been studying team working for more than 25 years, says a group of up to five people, using even basic telephone conferencing (he is sceptical about video adding much), can, over time, be more effective even than groups that meet face to face.Collaboration software that conceals rank and status also eases progress: “It does help people express their opinions more freely [when] they’re not intimidated by the presence of the chief executive,” he says.It occurs to me that one unsung benefit of corporate leaders clustering in Davos is that their absence from headquarters increases the efficiency of the teams they have left behind.Even so, what ought to be obvious to even the most digitised chief executives is that face-to-face meetings still count. There is still no better way to establish trust, which then helps virtual teams flourish. As Charles Handy, the management thinker (who makes a point of inviting new contacts to dine with him and his wife at the start of any relationship), has said: “You need to smell the person: you can’t do that on Facebook.” You cannot do it with a hologram either, he could have added.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill

Google was knocked from top spot into eighth place, and banks fell down the rankings.The annual list, now in its second year, was drawn up by employer review website Glassdoor, which seeks to make the marketplace for recruiting more transparent by combining free and anonymous reviews, ratings and salary content with job listings.Glassdoor’s 25 UK Best Places to Work in 2016 list features employers from a diverse range of industries spanning technology, banking, retail, fast-moving consumer goods and engineering. Of the UK employers on the list, only half are based in London, with others headquartered in regional cities such as Oxford, Cambridge and Reading.Expedia, which was top of this year’s rankings, is an online portal that lets users browse daily travel deals and choose from luxury to low-cost hotels, holidays, city breaks and flights.A London-based finance manager at Expedia in London said in the Glassdoor report: “Strong, friendly work culture. Work-life balance is seen as very important by all. Very supportive management team. So many perks! Free breakfast once a month, travel, health etc.”The 15 new names in this year’s list included ideas and innovation company AKQA (third place), GE (fourth) and high street shoe brand Schuh (fifth). Oxfam, in sixth place, was the only charity to make the cut. London Underground — better known for strike action than employee satisfaction — was a new entry in 10th place. The highest-ranking companies from last year’s list that did not make it in this year were Microsoft, Accenture and Jaguar Land Rover.Hays, the UK’s largest listed recruiter, climbed from 14th to second place this year while Unilever, which has a reputation for flexible working and sustainability, jumped from 24th to ninth.Fast-moving consumer goods replaced banking for the first time as the most popular career for business students worldwide, according to an annual survey a year ago from professional services firm Deloitte. Applications for Unilever’s graduate scheme increased 15 per cent between 2012 and 2014.Financial services groups slipped down the rankings. JPMorgan, the highest-ranking financial services company in last year’s inaugural list, fell from sixth place to 17th, while HSBC and Morgan Stanley dropped off the list altogether. Goldman Sachs was a new entry in 19th position, while Credit Suisse climbed three spots to number 20.Goldman recently revealed measures including quicker promotions, guaranteed rotations and less menial work to woo junior bankers.Among the “Big Four” accountancy firms, PwC fell from 10th to 21st place, while EY and Deloitte fell out of the list. Retailer John Lewis, which prides itself on its employee-owned model, slid from second to 16 in the rankings, while its Waitrose supermarket chain slipped three places to 25.Employees who write reviews on Glassdoor are asked to list the pros and cons of working for that company and to rate employer satisfaction based on factors such as career opportunities, compensation and benefits, culture and values, senior management and work-life balance.The 2016 UK Best Places to Work are determined based on the quantity, quality and consistency of the Glassdoor reviews.

Ebury’s existing major investor, 83 North, an Israel and UK-based venture capital group, also participated in the round.Investors are increasingly betting that European fintech groups can disrupt the decades-old business model of banks. In contrast to Silicon Valley companies, it is hoped that continental start-ups can gain an advantage from their proximity to the financial services sectors in countries such as the UK and Germany.The new investment makes Ebury one of the few fintech groups in Europe to raise more than $100m. Others include London-based companies WorldRemit, a money transfer group; Funding Circle, the peer-to-peer lender; and Dutch payments processor Adyen.Ebury operates in the UK, the Netherlands and Spain, but Juan Lobato, co-founder and co-chief executive said that the new investment would fuel its expansion into the US and further across Europe next year.“We’ve tested the business model in three different countries,” he said. “That gives us confidence that we can replicate it in many others . . . when we thought the model is right, did we decide to raise capital to go global aggressively.”The company offers a number of online services to small- and medium-sized businesses such as collecting money from overseas customers, moving cash between international subsidiaries and managing a company’s exposure to currency fluctuations.Ebury said that established banks had traditionally focused on large multinationals, ignoring smaller players that could not afford the more expensive bespoke services offered by financial institutions.The company did not reveal its financial performance or valuation. Since its founding in 2009, it has amassed 10,000 corporate customers and 300 employees worldwide.The funding is the latest sign of investor enthusiasm for fintech groups. According to figures from the consultancy Accenture, growth in investment in fintech groups tripled from $4.1bn in 2003 to $12.2bn in 2014.Though the US accounts for the lion’s share of global fintech investments, the fastest growing region is Europe, which saw a 215 per cent increase of funding to $1.48bn in 2014. The UK accounted for nearly 42 per cent of the European total.Ebury’s funding round is one of the largest by a European fintech group this year. Funding Circle raised $150m in April, WorldRemit took in $100m of funding in February, Swedish payments group iZettle raised €60m in August, and the UK money transfer group TransferWise raised $58m in January."
38;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-11-09T23:46:39Z;Hybrid consulting firms feed off digital fear;Threat of disruption from new competitors is driving growth;Management consulting’s success tends to be measured by the ebb and flow of demand for strategy consulting services, and the tide has definitely been coming in over the past year or so.Demand for strategy consulting, which advises top managers on the major long-term decisions they make, seems to be on the rise. A paradoxical combination of confidence and fear has driven big companies back to the strategy practices of the consulting firms — the high-end, high-margin part of the traditional business.Confidence comes from improving economic conditions and a sense, at the strongest companies, of being in a position to act on new visions of the future after weathering the financial crisis.Fear comes from the threat, chiefly, of disruption at the hands of new competitors, both from the digital domain and from growth markets such as China.As Bob Bechek, worldwide managing director of Bain, the consultancy, puts it: “The search for profitable growth in a world awash with capital drives a powerful desire for strategy advice.”Fee income from “strategy” consulting grew by 16 per cent in 2014, more than in recent years, according to Source Information Services, the industry research group. In some individual markets, growth in strategy consulting was even higher.The UK Management Consultancies Association — whose members do not include traditional “strategy houses” such as McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Bain — clocked the growth in strategy consulting at 44 per cent in 2014, an indication of how other consultants are now moving into this area.Yet as the borders are blurring between management consultants and other advisory groups (just as communications, advertising, headhunting and legal firms edge into adjacent areas), so the boundaries of strategy consulting are becoming harder to define.“Strategy has morphed into work around the growth agenda for corporations,” says Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source. “Other consulting firms see that as an opportunity.” She suggests that the likes of McKinsey, BCG and Bain are “in a castle of their own making with a wall around it — and that wall is of clients’ own perceptions [of the firms]”. Pretenders to the strategy crown, which include the Big Four professional services firms, plus Accenture, are bent on winning more lucrative, high-end advisory work. They are also throwing large numbers of staff at implementation and operational improvement tasks.In one sense, there is little new in the way in which different consulting practices are overlapping — mingling strategy with execution. When he founded his firm in 1926, James O. McKinsey, described it as a group of “accountants and management engineers” even though he employed no actual engineers.44%Fee income growth in 2014 for strategy consulting workAs Christopher Wright and Matthias Kipping observed in The Oxford Handbook of Management Consulting, it is a “myth” that management consulting is “solely the province of boardroom advisers”.Even in the “gilded age” of strategy consultants in the 1960s, the largest companies were in fact operational improvement firms such as HB Maynard (later bought by Accenture).What has now emerged, though, is a breed of hybrid consultants, who claim — like half-man, half-horse centaurs — to offer all the advantages of strategic vision and more detailed digital knowledge or big data expertise.Now, like most of its peers, McKinsey employs plenty of engineers — and integrates their work with that of the strategy practice.“[Clients] need to make good decisions that lead to appropriate resource allocation towards the right things for execution and implementation,” says Sven Smit, a McKinsey director.Rich Lesser, the head of Boston Consulting Group — whose founder Bruce Henderson claims to have “defined” strategy consulting — points to his firm’s ability to develop software tools that allow clients to analyse their research pipeline, for instance.Maintaining that “we have no desire to be a software company”, he sees strength however in “blending” teams across practices.Accenture Strategy, while not claiming to compete with the traditional strategy groups, describes its 8,000 consultants as a combination of technology strategists and business strategists.Returning to consulting in a big way since a retreat in the wake of the Enron scandal, the Big Four accountants— PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, and EY — continue to push their one-stop-shop approach.One of the keys to McKinsey’s early growth, as Duff McDonald writes in his 2013 history, The Firm, was “to persuade people that [its] ability to solve problems was just as inspired as the solutions themselves”.16%Fee income growth in 2014 for strategy consultantsFor all consultancies, this has become more difficult as the clients themselves have developed their own strategic knowledge, with the help of former consultants or staff trained in the same disciplines as their advisers.“If a company already has sufficient resources inside itself to tackle the problems it faces, they are going to reach for external consultants less. So external consultants have had to change what they offer,” points out Chris Osborne, co-chairman for Europe, Middle East and Africa at FTI Consulting, which often works alongside other consultants offering specific expertise to customers in areas such as regulation.But Ms Czerniawska says that while clients “are much better able to do the kind of things consultants did in the past, it doesn’t mean they have the capacity”.Provided consultancies can continue to offer sufficiently expert advice, combined with ever more powerful analytical tools that companies have neither the time nor skills to develop in-house, they are likely to be able to command a premium for their services.Even so, it is clear that just as digital disruption is driving business to the consultancies, and greater availability of data is allowing more profound analysis of what is going on in clients’ businesses, consultancies face growing pressures to offer ever more compelling combinations of strategic advice.Strategy houses used to apply a stable strategic framework to examine where a company should compete, how, and when. They would then proceed to a plan to execute the strategy.Now they are obliged to adapt those strategic answers to fast-changing global realities, and to back them with empirical evidence, gleaned on the hoof from analysis of the dynamic data provided by the client.“The profession called consulting has had to innovate more in the last five years than in the previous 20,” says Vivian Hunt, McKinsey director.
39;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-11-09T23:46:39Z;Strategy specialists forced to amend their offering;Clients have become better educated and more sophisticated;As a distinct niche of the broader consulting industry, the strategy specialisation emerged after the second world war, principally among a small group of American consulting firms. Many of these have been acquired or disappeared, but one notable survivor is McKinsey.Business consulting had emerged much earlier, around the beginning of the 20th century in the US and Europe. The first waves of consulting firms concentrated on applying to large-scale manufacturing the principles of scientific management, made famous through the work of Frederick Taylor and others.Other firms also came into existence to work on accounting and control problems presented by the scale and growing complexity of the largest enterprises. Strategy consulting was distinctive in being concerned with the agendas of top managers, advising them on the application of major decisions like mergers and international expansion.The term strategy was not commonly used at first. Indeed, much of what strategy firms did in the 1950s and 1960s was concerned more with organisational matters rather than what might be called pure strategy. At the same time, the discipline of strategic management was emerging in leading business schools, drawing on economics and ideas from military planning.The emergence of strategic consulting as a term to describe these firms’ distinctive activities and claims of expertise occurred in the 1970s. During this period firms such as McKinsey, Bain and the Boston Consulting Group were busy defining theories which would shape the industry.One could think of the period between the 1960s and 1990s as a golden period for strategy consulting. The leading firms developed reputations for this work particularly as the notion of building a sustainable competitive advantage came to underpin what strategy meant. Other advances in academic thinking, such as the idea of building unique resource and capability bases to support a strategic position, further helped to develop the market.Since then, the business of strategy consulting has evolved for a number of reasons. One is that clients themselves have become better educated and more sophisticated, not least because of the proliferation of MBA and executive education. Most executives have an excellent overview of the concept of strategy and now want to focus on how to execute well. At the same time, strategies have become more temporary or emergent and companies have been encouraged to be agile and more entrepreneurial, particularly as digital technologies have transformed industries. and created new opportunities. And today, companies have also to be seen to be doing the right thing. These trends have been reflected in the activities of consulting firms.So I see the activities of strategy specialists spreading across a number of areas. A niche speciality remains pure strategy in the sense of advising clients on creating and sustaining competitive advantages. Aiding these specialists is the use of big data to deepen their analytic capabilities.More mainstream strategy now focuses on implementation processes, or strategy execution (in a way that echoes earlier work on organisational effectiveness in the 1950s). This is the somewhat crowded domain of the established strategy firms as well as Accenture, IBM and the Big Four accounting and advisory firms. Further consolidation would not be surprising.A third area is innovation: just as the discipline of strategy in business schools has expanded into areas such as entrepreneurship, so consulting firms are developing capabilities to address clients’ concerns with renewal.And a fourth area plays to the term purpose, the successor to vision (which itself replaced plans and goals) as the buzzword of chief executives. Purpose links strategy to the wider stakeholder demands facing today’s chief executives along with the question of how to differentiate organisations and bolster commitment among employees.Purpose also links to leadership development so it invites a range of potential interventions, such as counselling, that can be combined into a lucrative consulting-client relationship. Purpose also encapsulates the preoccupations of leaders in the early 21st century, when the relative simplicity of competitive advantage has given way to more complex and dynamic leadership challenges. Successful consulting firms will be the ones that seize the opportunities this complexity presents.The author is professor of Management Studies at Saïd Business School, University of Oxford
40;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-10-29T16:38:22Z;Some new hires for a more connected Deutsche Bank;If CEO wants to fix the IT problems he should start looking for top-notch computer engineers;"A few years ago, I was given a tour of Deutsche Bank’s London trading floor. To an outsider, it seemed dazzling: the cavernous room contained banks of computer screens that appeared to ooze 21st-century high tech. But that was (and is) a mirage.Yesterday, John Cryan, the recently installed Deutsche Bank co-chief executive, unveiled plans to restructure the bank. Aside from cutting 9,000 jobs, Mr Cryan has apparently decided that the bank’s IT system is so utterly dysfunctional — a “Horlicks” of a mess, as he likes to say, using British slang — that he urgently has to rip it out.That is partly because some systems are outdated. However, the bigger curse is fragmentation: different departments and trading desks have apparently been using separate computing platforms that cannot easily be reconciled. The London trading floor alone has 100-odd different trade booking systems.That fragmentation has made it hard for Deutsche Bank managers to get a timely overview of trades or efficiently complete trades — which, in turn, may have contributed to mistakes.In many ways, this revelation is startling. Eight long years ago the top managers of western banks learnt the hard way just how damaging fragmentation can be; most notably, banks such as UBS suffered big losses in the financial crisis because they were divided into so many silos that it was impossible for top managers to get an overview of risks.That experience left most risk managers pledging to take a more joined-up approach.Some banks, such as Goldman Sachs, have invested heavily to integrate their IT systems. But many others have not. On the contrary, as a recent report by McKinsey notes, at some banks “a history of acquisitions and historical budgetary constraints has resulted in an IT and data architecture that is highly fragmented”. Or to put it another way, Deutsche Bank is not alone in making a total “Horlicks” of it.Is there any solution? One obvious response is for banks to raise IT spending (it seems that Deutsche Bank’s problems were exacerbated because the bank was trying to boost margins and cutting back on investment). Another, equally important, move is for banks to give more authority, status and pay to the IT staff.Until recently, most senior bankers assumed that IT operations sat in a separate division of their own, separated from core operations. Indeed, according to a report from Accenture, a mere 6 per cent of bank board directors have any technical background, and almost half the world’s biggest 109 banks do not have any directors with a technical background at all.A third step is for the top managers of the banks to engage in a wider debate about the nature of the IT systems they are building. Historically, banks have tended to create gigantic proprietary systems. This sometimes made sense for reasons of security.But the problem with having a ­specialised proprietary system is that it tends to be inflexible and hard to integrate, partly because there is only a tiny coterie of technical experts who ­understand it. Moving towards a system based on open-source technologies might enable banks to integrate their IT more successfully, not least because it could reduce the reliance on a small team of experts who are incentivised to protect the past — and their power base.But the fourth, and biggest, step that banks need to take is to stop thinking of technology as just a computing problem — and recognise that it is also rooted in culture. This sounds obvious. But it is often forgotten, precisely because computing technology appears to be a disembodied, inhuman thing.However, social patterns matter deeply, particularly in banks where traders have financial incentives to cling to tribal power structures, and only care about the interests of their immediate trading desks (since that is how they get paid). Or, to put it another way, while most of us assume — almost unthinkingly — that computers are a tool that can connect people and break barriers down, they do not always have that impact; on the contrary, they can sometimes create more separation, but in subtle and often unnoticed ways.So if Mr Cryan now wants to fix Deutsche Bank’s IT problems, he should certainly start looking for top-notch computer engineers. He should also prepare to invest more. But he would also be wise to hire a few social scientists, too, to get a more clearsighted vision of how bankers interact with each other and their machines; or, more accurately, how they often do not interact — even in a seemingly hyper-connected age.gillian.tett@ft.com"
41;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Bank directors have lack of technology know-how, study finds;Almost half of the world’s biggest financial groups have no board members with any tech experience;Only 6 per cent of the directors overseeing the world’s biggest banks have any technology experience even though issues ranging from cyber security to digital challengers have shot up their boardroom agenda, a study has found.Almost half of the world’s 109 biggest banks have no board members with any technology experience and a further quarter of them have only one such director, according to the research by Accenture.“Very few banks have technologists on their boards and yet when you look at the big strategic challenges facing their business, particularly from financial technology companies, a lot of banks’ revenue is under threat from this area,” said Richard Lumb, head of financial services at Accenture.The study counted up all the bank directors who have ever had senior technology responsibilities in a company, such as chief information officer, or who have had senior responsibilities at a technology company, such as sitting on its board as a non-executive.So, for example, Sir Mike Rake, deputy chairman of Barclays, counted as having technology experience as he is non-executive chairman of telecoms group BT — even though he spent most of his career as an accountant at KPMG.Banks in the US and UK scored highest on the proportion of their directors who have such technology experience, but even they only reach 15.7 and 14.3 per cent respectively.The lowest figures came from banks in Brazil, Greece, Italy, and Russia, which have no directors with a background in technology. French banks have only 3 per cent of directors with technology experience, while Spanish and Swiss banks have less than 7 per cent.Financial services companies compare poorly to most other industries in this area. A recent study by headhunters Russell Reynolds found financial groups had less than a third of the digital experience on their boards than other sectors, such as healthcare and consumer goods.“If your main competition now comes from financial technology companies and not banks and the biggest threat you face is cyber security, then technology has become so ingrained in your business that you really need to know something about it,” said Mr Lumb.He recommended that banks set up technology committees on their boards, a step only 11 per cent of lenders have taken. Examples of banks that have done so include Nationwide in the UK and Citigroup in the US.Many banks have been trying to add technology expertise to their board. Spain’s BBVA, which is run by former IBM executive Francisco González, promoted its head of digital banking to its board this year as president and chief operating officer.However, some banks seem to find it hard to attract top technology figures to their boards. Sir David Walker, the former chairman of Barclays, told the Financial Times that it was hunting for such a person in December, but none has arrived on its board yet.Sir Philip Hampton, the former chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland — which has suffered some damaging IT outages in recent years — said this summer that it was looking to add a technology expert to its board, but he added “they are not easy to find”.

Founder & CEO, FacebookMark Zuckerberg, the 31-year old founder and chief executive of Facebook, has been one of the most instrumental allies in the global campaign for LGBT equality this year, writes Daniel Barabas. His influence is undeniable, given that he sits at the helm of a digital community with 1.4bn users.Most notably in June Facebook launched “Pride-ify”, a rainbow picture filter that more than 26m people — including numerous celebrities and heads of state — used when the US Supreme Court was ruling on marriage equality. The campaign became so difficult to ignore that conservative leaders in Russia called for the site to be shut down until the campaign ended.Mr Zuckerberg has said Facebook, the most widely used social media forum globally (one in seven people in the world use it) has a mandate to facilitate a tolerant digital environment, stressing: “Our country was founded on the promise that all people are created equal.”For example, Facebook users have 71 ways to define their sexuality and gender or can use their own label. Mr Zuckerberg himself has also marched in San Francisco’s Pride parade, acting as a role model for Facebook’s 10,000 employees around the world.2 Sir Richard Branson

43;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-10-07T23:24:23Z;Aversion to risk hampers growth of German fintech sector;The bulk of innovation has focused on consumer-facing finance;"Last year fintech really caught the imagination of investors. Around the world, $12.2bn was poured into groups applying new technology to the world of finance, according to Accenture. That was three times the level invested in 2013.Fintech’s rise has been driven by a variety of factors. Perhaps the most important is the inexorable rise of mobile technology, which has encouraged consumers to organise increasing parts of their life online. But other factors such as low interest rates have also played a role, by making start-ups a more attractive investment for those with capital at their disposal, and few attractive sources of yield.Many of the biggest investments in 2014 came in the US, where Lending Club, the world’s biggest peer-to-peer lender, raised $865m in a stock market listing, and where KKR and other investors injected a total of $3.5bn into the payment processing company, First Data Corp.However, Germany, which has a vibrant start-up scene in its capital, Berlin, also has an array of fintech companies it can point to. Last week, Kreditech, which provides credit and banking products for consumers who have little or no credit history, raised €82.5m in a funding round involving investors such as JC Flowers.Other fintech groups attracting attention and funding include Weltsparen, which allows savers to switch their money between accounts in different countries to take advantage of the various interest rates paid on deposits; and WebID, which allows customers to sign up for bank accounts by identifying themselves online, thus sparing them a trip to their local branch or post-office.Asset management and insurance are also in fintech’s crosshairs. One fintech group going after the insurance market is Clark, which helps customers keep track of and optimise their insurance policies online, a smart move in Germany where adults have, on average, five insurance contracts.So far, the bulk of the innovation in the fintech sector has focused on the consumer-facing parts of finance, such as transaction services, balance checks and peer-to-peer lending.However, this balance could well change, as the established banks start to play a larger role in the sector. Commerzbank, Germany’s second-largest bank, which invests in start-ups through its Main Incubator and CommerzVentures entities, has so far made five fintech investments in a variety of companies, some of which could have applications for either private or corporate clients.Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender is also entering the fray. It plans to open innovation hubs in London, Berlin and Silicon Valley to try to improve its use of digital technology.According to Phil Gilligan, who is in charge of the project, Deutsche’s hub in Berlin is likely to focus more on applying fintech ideas to retail banking, while the hub in London will experiment with technologies that could have applications for other parts of the bank. The focus for the Silicon Valley hub has not yet been set.In aggregate, however, investments in German fintech are lagging behind the levels seen in other European countries. According to Accenture, German fintechs attracted $82m in investments in 2014. That compared with $306m in the Netherlands, $345m in the Baltic region, and $623m in the UK and Ireland.Germany is not the first place in which you would try out new productsPeople involved in the fintech scene cite a variety of reasons for this shortfall. One, says Christopher Oster, chief executive of Clark, is that some German investors tend to be more risk-averse than their peers elsewhere.Another problem is regulation. Entrepreneurs say that German financial regulators often err on the side of gold-plating their rules, which can make it harder for start-ups to thrive.One example, says Thomas Fürst, managing director and founder of WebID, was Germany’s interpretation of a European rule that people wishing to open a bank account should identify themselves “face-to-face”. This, he says, forced banks and consumers to follow a laborious process of identifying themselves in branches, rather than online.Bettina Orlopp, head of group development and strategy at Commerzbank, takes a similar line. “Consumer protection rules are tougher in Germany than elsewhere . . . There is a lot of talent in Germany, but it’s not necessarily the first place you would try out new products.”However, Germany also has factors in its favour. Although language barriers can make it more expensive for fintech groups to expand in Europe, rather than in the US, for example, Germany is still Europe’s biggest single market, giving access to a population of 80m.The presence of Frankfurt, one of Europe’s main banking centres, is also a boon for those interested in financial innovation. And a well-educated population also helps.Those start-ups that do succeed will transform the face of banking, says Jürgen Moormann, professor of bank and process management at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. “Most fintechs will die. But some will prosper, just like direct banks 20 years ago,” he says, referring to the online-only lenders that have challenged the branch-based model of traditional banks.“People said then that they had no chance. But now they are established.”"
44;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-08-02T11:22:56Z;Feedback: The death of annual performance reviews;Some readers shared Lucy Kellaway’s aversion to the ritual but others leapt to its defence;Lucy Kellaway last week applauded Accenture’s decision to end annual performance reviews, saying such appraisals demotivate staff and spread cynicism. Some readers shared her aversion to the ritual but others leapt to its defence.Sadly I was party to these charades for many years. What made them especially unfair and dysfunctional was the inclusion of commentary by many people who had very little knowledge of the person being appraised simply to extend the pretence of behaving like “partners”. AwareAn annual appraisal is a good long-term planning tool. EzraBravo to the thought leaders! Let’s hope others see the light and make that change. NatashiaLucy is missing the point. Annual reviews, when tied to salary increases as they generally are, serve to reaffirm the employer’s relation to the employee as one-to-one. The alternative to individual annual reviews isn’t no reviews, it’s collective bargaining agreements. D MaynardAnd now we welcome the new organisational fad. All the stupid corporate managers will jump through hoops to hire Accenture, Deloitte and other consulting bandits to tell them how to do this new thing. Honest John
45;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-07-26T12:26:49Z;A blast of common sense frees staff from appraisals;Accenture’s decision to remove the annual performance review is welcome news;"Last week I did the most unexpectedly uplifting thing I’d done in ages. I was in need of cheering as I’d just sat through a documentary in which the brilliant, bulimic Amy Winehouse drinks herself to death — but never did I think I’d find such solace in a video clip showing the head of Accenture talking about his latest management initiative.In the space of a minute Pierre Nanterme said something wonderful: he is going to free all 330,000 of his staff from the charade of the annual job appraisal. “We are not sure that spending all that time in performance management has been yielding such a great outcome,” he told the Washington Post. “Once a year [I] share with you what I think of you. That doesn’t make any sense. People want to know . . . am I doing all right? Nobody’s going to wait for an annual cycle to get that feedback.”The most extraordinary thing about this blast of common sense is that it comes from Accenture, which over the years has delivered some world-class, paradigm-busting drivel. It was Accenture that brought us the embarrassing “Be greater than” hieroglyphic in its name.Not only does the company itself spout waffle, so too do its higher officers.It was Accenture that came up with the slogan: “High performance. Delivered” — that is so long on guff and so short on grammar.The fact that this company has now noticed what has been apparent to every office worker and every manager in the western world for a couple of decades, gives me great joy. This is very exciting indeed. Performance reviews will soon be over for all of us.Accenture is not the first. Earlier this year Deloitte started to dismantle its extraordinarily cumbersome appraisal machinery, which takes 2m hours a year to churn out one appraisal for 65,000 people. If you think of that in terms of opportunity cost and assume that even the most junior Deloitte people hire themselves out for £100 an hour, the firm has been wasting at least £200m a year on a system that rewards the wrong people, demotivates almost everyone and spreads boredom and cynicism all around.Do you notice something strange in this? Both of these companies have large consultancy divisions that sell “human capital solutions”. Over the past few decades both have been charging fat fees in return for stuffing their clients with dreadful appraisal systems. Just like their own.High performance. Delivered, Accenture claims. But what happens if it hasn’t been delivering high performance at all? What if it has been delivering clunky performance management “solutions” that turn reasonable people into alienated cynics? What then?Should the current management of Deloitte and Accenture say sorry for all those useless annual appraisal systems they have prescribed in the past? Should they go further and repay fees, and compensate for the damage?This is very exciting indeed. Performance reviews will soon be over for all of usIt would be nice; only it isn’t going to happen. The way in which both firms admitted that their own internal systems were rubbish was very clever. Instead of saying that they were a terrible idea in the first place because they are based on an elementary misunderstanding of what it is to be human, they argued that the problem with them is that they no longer fit the new I-want-it-now world. “It’s all about instant performance management,” said the Accenture boss.This is doubly clever. Not only does it mean apologies are not called for, it means a new stream of revenue as they advise clients to replace the old systems with new speedier ones.It is not yet clear how the new appraisals will work, though I fear they will involve vast amounts of data. Accenture has said appraisals in future will be “all about you”, which sounds superficially promising, but I’m not holding my breath.Deloitte has come up with four things which its own managers are asked every quarter about each member of their teams. The questions (which I have rather improved by paraphrasing) go like this: does this person deserve lots more money? Do I like having them on my team? Do I think they are likely to screw up big time? Would I promote them today?The beauty of these questions is that they are simple and they don’t cost £100m. Better still, Deloitte will insist that all its managers check in with the people they manage once a week. This is so sensible, that one wonders why they have only just thought of it.My suggestion is even simpler — to replace annual appraisals with nothing at all. Hire only managers who are able to manage, and who are good at telling people how they are doing, not once a week but all the time. If they aren’t up for this, they should not be made managers. If they are up to it, they don’t need an appraisal system as a crutch. They are better without one.lucy.kellaway@ft.com

• 4CAST Economic CalendarDiary commentary from FT reporters; data and company announcements, unless otherwise stated, from Thomson Reuters. Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.Stagecoach was given a boost last week after the UK competition authorities formally cleared it to take on the London-to-Edinburgh East Coast rail franchise.The Competition and Markets Authority had questioned the government’s decision to hand the contract to Stagecoach and Virgin Rail, citing concerns over their market share on sections of the London-Scotland route. But the clearance removes any clouds hanging over the lucrative contract at the transport company’s full-year results on Wednesday.Analysts said investors would be watching closely for early indications of how the franchise, which was awarded in November and began in March, is going. The contract will start adding to earnings in the 2015-16 financial year.The group will also give an update on the performance of its US Megabus business, which has been suffering from slowing revenue growth as falling oil prices led to more people driving.In April, Stagecoach warned that it remained “cautious” on the short-term prospects for Megabus revenue growth in the US as the fuel price drop persists. Tanya PowleyAs what looks to be a Mexican stand-off between Monsanto and the target of its unsolicited bid, Switzerland-based Syngenta, drags on, investors will be looking for hints for the US seeds and chemicals group’s next move as it announces its third-quarter results.Some were surprised at the language Syngenta used when it rejected Monsanto’s latest approach earlier this month after the US company sweetened its $45bn cash and share offer earlier this month with a $2bn break-up fee.Syngenta said the termination fee was “paltry” and the SFr449 ($485) a share offer “grossly inadequate”. This was deemed by some M&A experts as particularly strong, even if Monsanto failed to up its offer price.The US agricultural seeds and chemicals company is pursuing a “tax inversion” acquisition of rival Syngenta, with the merged entity to be domiciled in the UK under a new name.The quarterly results are expected to reveal how the continuing sluggishness in agricultural markets and falling farmers’ incomes is affecting Monsanto’s business.But the US group’s management is likely to spend more time answering questions about political risks surrounding the Syngenta transaction as well as the regulatory risks surrounding the deal.

Stagecoach, FY: 25.8p (25.8p)Investors in Hennes & Mauritz will be hoping the Swedish clothing retailer can do the same for profitability in the second quarter as it did for revenues.The purveyor of cheap chic reported second-quarter sales up 21 per cent to SKr45.9bn, ahead of analysts’ expectation of SKr44.7bn. Revenues in the quarter to the end of May were helped by the weakness of the Swedish crown even though clothing sales in Germany — H&M’s biggest market — were weak.There is likely to be close attention paid to H&M’s gross margin on Thursday — an important gauge of profitability for retailers — with some worry among investors of how the Swedish company is likely to pay more to source its clothes.Inditex, H&M’s long-time rival and the Spanish owner of Zara, earlier this month reported its strongest quarterly profit growth in more than two years as it reaped the rewards from a weaker euro. Net profit in its first quarter, which runs to the end of April, increased 28 per cent. Richard MilneNike is expected to post a solid rise in fourth-quarter earnings, although its healthy profits could be overshadowed by a scandal at Fifa that has threatened to entangle the world’s largest sportswear brand.The consensus analyst estimate is for earnings per share of 0.83 cents, a 6.8 per cent rise, on the back of a 3.4 per cent increase in sales to $7.7bn for the three months to May 31. The anticipated rise follows an earlier estimate by the company for orders between March and July to rise 11 per cent in constant currencies.Strong profits on the back of demand for its sportswear have helped boost the company’s shares despite wide public interest in concerns that the company might end up embroiled in the bribery scandal at Fifa. The shares are up 3.1 per cent since the story unravelled at the end of May and are up 11 per cent this year.The company has not been named in any indictment associated with the scandal. But a deal that US prosecutors have referred to appears identical to one signed by Nike and Brazil’s football federation CBF in 1996.Nike has declined to comment on whether or not it is the unnamed company mentioned in the indictment. In separate statements in May, it said that it has been co-operating with the authorities and will continue to do so, and that the documents do not allege that it engaged in criminal conduct, or that any employee was aware of or knowingly participated in any scheme.It has pushed ahead with more deals with key sports associations.

47;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-05-27T23:57:54Z;Branding offers staff a higher purpose;Corporate image advertising can help employees feel better about their jobs;As they cruise the travelators and walk the terminals, passengers at London’s Heathrow airport will notice that, along with the advertisements for duty-free drinks and perfumes, there are dozens of adverts for companies such as Accenture and HSBC. These stick out because they are not really meant for the companies’ customers even though they are hanging on the walls of what feels like a consumer space. In fact, they are there to speak as much to those who are employed by these companies as they do to others who might be thinking about using their services.“If you think back to the campaign Accenture did with Tiger Woods, you might have wondered how good these ads were at selling the product,” says Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at London’s Cass Business School. But remember that management consultants are away from the office for long periods and spend a lot of time in transport hubs, he says, and then it makes more sense. “You realise that this is a way for the organisation to engage with its employees.”Lucy Jameson, chief executive of the advertising agency Grey London, which has worked on such adverts with HSBC and GlaxoSmithKline, says they perform a dual function: “With many of our clients, a lot of the message is at least, in part, internal.” Moreover, she notes, when you take a message that is internal (and might once have come in the form of a memo or newsletter) and take it outside into the consumer space, “it is a much more visible, public commitment and has greater weight”.Traditionally, branding was something that companies did to attract consumers and if the brand also had a positive effect on staff, that was a bonus.However, virtually all companies now brand inwards and outwards. If the brand is right, people will want the product and if the brand is right, people will also feel better about working for the company and good people who do not work for the company may be more interested in doing so.Sammie Stapleton, PwC’s head of talent channels, says, “We use a lot of consumer space for recruitment campaigns — places like London Bridge station and Waterloo, but also airports, taxis and university campuses.“It’s not just about attracting potential candidates. It also reminds existing staff that these are growth areas.”Indeed, some of the advertising in financial districts such as the City can seem little more than saying: “We are here and successful enough to advertise.” But in a competitive market for talent, this may be a message that is worth getting across.In its recent report 2020 Outlook: The Future of Employer Branding, Universum surveyed more than 2,000 executives and found that, across a variety of criteria such as long-term recruitment and differentiation from competitors, they expected employer branding to become more strategically important over the next five years. Moreover, 29 per cent said that in that time the employer and consumer brands would merge into one.Employer and consumer branding are expected to merge into oneThis is perhaps at its most obvious among technology companies, where the brand acts as a powerful retention and recruitment tool. Universum recently named Google the world’s most attractive employer in its annual rankings of companies for which business students want to work.Branding to staff also helps when a company has many different operations spread across the world. Amy Leaper, head of people innovation at Virgin Management, says that Virgin Money in the UK might look and feel different from Virgin Active in South Africa, but that both share values and the brand provides a focus for these. “We refer to the brand as the red thread that runs through all our companies.” It also helps assimilate staff when new businesses become part of the group, she notes.Prof Spicer suggests that for some businesses the employer brand may be as important to employees as the actual work they do, if not more so: “You work for Ikea, rather than stacking shelves.”In this sense, employer branding supplies a unifying higher purpose, which recalls the famous (possibly apocryphal) story about President Kennedy asking a janitor at Nasa what he was doing. The janitor responded, “I’m helping put a man on the moon.”This can be particularly important for employees in maligned sectors, such as banking and oil. “You can almost make a virtue of pariah status — you put around the message that people don’t like us because they don’t understand us. We are the chosen few,” says Prof Spicer.It is one way to welcome home travel-weary employees and improve the chance they will stick with you, even though they spend so much of their time at airports.
48;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;UK trader arrested over 2010 flash crash;Futures trader charged by US authorities with wire and commodities fraud to appear in London court;A UK futures trader operating out of a suburban house under the approach path to Heathrow airport is due in a London court on Wednesday after being charged by US authorities for allegedly contributing to the 2010 “flash crash”, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge more than 600 points in a matter of minutes.Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, of Hounslow, was arrested in Britain and US authorities are seeking to extradite him to stand trial in Illinois.He was charged with one count of wire fraud, 10 counts of commodities fraud, 10 counts of commodities manipulation and one count of spoofing, a form of market manipulation that involves putting on an order and swiftly withdrawing it before a trade can take place.Mr Sarao, who could not immediately be reached for comment, is due to answer the charges at Westminster magistrates' court in central London on Wednesday morning.The Department of Justice estimates that he made about $40m in total between 2010 and 2014 trading in S&P 500 futures contracts.The flash crash of May 6 2010 led to shares in well-known companies such as General Electric and Accenture trading at just one cent during the mayhem, and thousands of trades were subsequently cancelled.The chaos across US equities exchanges was triggered by a large move in the underlying futures market. The repercussions rattled other markets that trade electronically including bonds and currencies, illustrating the potential risks of a global financial system linked by high-powered computerised trading companies.The DoJ alleges in a criminal complaint that Mr Sarao used an automated trading program to manipulate the market for S&P 500 futures contracts — known as E-Minis — on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the largest US futures market.US authorities probing the ‘flash crash’ that rattled global stocks in 2010 have spent years trying to understand the factors behind the sudden US market plunge. On Tuesday they zeroed in on an unassuming house in the suburban heart of a working class Indian and Bangladeshi community 17 miles west of the City, London’s financial heart.Continue readingIn the complaint, it details that Mr Sarao told the UK Financial Conduct Authority that he was “an old school point and click prop trader” who had “always been good with reflexes and doing things quick”.The authorities said he used a variety of trading techniques designed to push prices sharply in one direction and then profit from other investors following the pattern or exiting the market.The DoJ said by allegedly placing multiple, simultaneous, large-volume sell orders at different price points — a technique known as “layering”— Mr Sarao created the appearance of substantial supply in the market.Layering is a type of spoofing, a strategy of entering bids or offers with the intent to cancel them before completion.Spoofing was outlawed in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation. Last year, federal prosecutors brought the first criminal spoofing case, charging a New Jersey trader of manipulating commodities markets and making a $1.6m profit.It is claimed that Mr Sarao had established companies in Nevis and Anguilla to shelter his assets from tax. According to the criminal complaint, the Nevis -incorporated company was called Nav Sarao Milking Markets Ltd.Mr Sarao is alleged to have run his operation from his UK residence. The registered address of his company, Nav Sarao Futures Limited, is a modest semi-detached house on a residential street in the Hounslow district of west London. It is about 17 miles west of the City, London’s financial centre.The CME observed that between September 2008 and October 2009 Mr Sarao had engaged in pre-opening activity, specifically, entering orders and cancelling those that “appeared to have a significant impact on the indicative opening price”, according to the complaint.The CME contacted Mr Sarao and his broker about this activity in March 2009 and notified him, in correspondence dated May 6 2010, that “all orders entered on Globex during the pre-opening are expected to be entered in good faith for the purpose of executing bona fide transactions”.The US equity market ‘flash crash’ of May 6 2010 has long highlighted the pronounced link between futures exchange contracts and the share prices of companies bought and sold by investors of all stripes.Continue readingIn response, Mr Sarao wrote in an email to his broker dated May 25 2010 that he had “just called” the CME “and told ‘em to kiss my ass”.In a July 7 2010 email to Eurex, he explained that he “trade[d] extremely fast” and claimed that “[a]ll orders are entered/deleted manually by me and only me”.The US government’s case was aided by an anonymous whistleblower who investigated the flash crash for hundreds of hours over several years, according to Shayne Stevenson, an attorney for the whistleblower and a partner at Hagens Berman law firm.After regulators released their findings of the flash crash, the CME vigorously defended the operational integrity of the futures market and the E-Mini contract.The repercussions of the flash crash included the introduction of circuit breakers to halt trading in US companies should their price change too quickly.Additional reporting by Mark Odell and Nicole BullockThis article has been amended to correct Mr Sarao’s ageLetter in response to this report:‘Flash crash’ claims recall other market activities / From Ian Greatorex
49;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-04-21T19:34:38Z;How futures trading could crash stocks;2010 flash crash highlighted how ‘e-mini’ contracts can sway equities;The US equity market ‘flash crash’ of May 6 2010 has long highlighted the pronounced link between futures exchange contracts and the share prices of companies bought and sold by investors of all stripes.Regulators digging into what sparked an abrupt collapse of share prices, where the likes of Accenture briefly traded at 1 cent per share before a stunning rebound inside twenty minutes, concluded back in 2010 that trading via equity futures in Chicago was the spark that had lit the flash crash fuse.Now the US Department of Justice has alleged that a UK-based trader contributed by manipulating the trading in S&P 500 equity contracts, known as E-minis, which are listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The CME launched the e-mini as an electronic contract in 1997, with a lower size than the standard S&P 500 futures contracts that were being transacted on its trading floor in open outcry pits by traders gesticulating furiously with elaborate hand signals.The e-mini contract’s cut-down size reflected the view that electronic trading prospers with smaller trade lots and the market duly flourished. The e-mini tracks the world’s largest equity market, which includes the top 500 US companies with a combined market capitalisation of $19.2tn. The CME has subsequently expanded its list of e-mini contracts across a range of financial markets.The trading of e-mini S&P 500 contracts also occurs over 23.5 hours of the day, beyond the normal trading hours of 9:30am to 4:00pm in New York for listed cash equities. The futures contract thereby provides investors across the world with a liquid and fast way to trade US equities across computerised systems. Many professional investors rely on S&P E-minis to insulate their portfolios of stocks against sudden and large changes in the broad market.The e-mini contract thus acts as a key gauge of sentiment before and after the cash equity market’s usual trading hours. However, futures trading — like other markets — has also been associated with efforts by some traders to manipulate prices using techniques such as spoofing, layering prices and front-running.Moreover, the 1987 stock market crash was blamed in part on investors selling equity futures to protect themselves against losses, known as portfolio insurance.Thanks to the pronounced rise of electronic trading across US equities since 2007, the links between futures and cash shares have never been so strong in terms of reaction and trading volumes.In October 2010, US regulators issued a 104-page report that said the trigger for the flash crash was the sale of 75,000 e-mini futures contracts on the S&P 500 stock index, worth $4.1bn.The ensuing evaporation of buyers for the e-mini contracts pushed prices sharply lower and created a liquidity crisis, compounded in seconds by high-powered computerised trading systems. Once so-called high-frequency trading systems saw the large sell order, they pulled back and exited the market, contributing to a rapid decline in futures and cash equity prices.The pronounced electronic link between trading futures and cash-based equities meant that the evaporation of liquidity in Chicago instantly swept across computerised systems and across the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.The repercussions of the flash crash included the introduction of circuit breakers to halt trading in US companies should their price change too quickly, and calls for regulating high-speed trading of so-called high-frequency trading firms.

Anaylsts’ forecasts had been for sales at the top end of the range”.Earnings in the range of $1.79-$1.82 a share missed estimates.The North Carolina-based company announced a $500m share buyback programme, to replace a $300m programme that is scheduled to expire at the end of the month.Red Hat shares, which have advanced 31 per cent in the past year, gained 10 per cent to $75.36.A rally in shares of Red Hat and Accenture, which climbed nearly 7 per cent to $94.17, helped lift technology stocks, which had posted their biggest one-day decline in nearly a year on Wednesday.ConAgra Foods fell nearly 1 per cent after the company reported a fiscal third-quarter loss and took a $1.3bn goodwill impairment charge on its private label business.ConAgra reported a loss of $954m in the three months to February 22. Sales fell 1.8 per cent during the period to $3.88bn, led by a 5 per cent drop in the private brands division.ConAgra also raised its adjusted earnings forecast for this fiscal year to a range of $2.15-$2.19 per share compared with analysts’ estimates of $2.14 per share.Lululemon shares advanced 5 per cent to $63.97 after the athletic wear maker known for its yoga gear said total comparable sales climbed 8 per cent in the fourth quarter.The news came alongside better than expected fourth-quarter earnings and sales.Investors on Thursday took a more optimistic view on cyclical sectors, which are highly correlated to the US economy. Materials and technology stocks on the S&P 500 were up 0.2 per cent.Downbeat US data has weighed on cyclical stocks over the past five days. “With the exception of the labour market data, most data has been consistently soft,” said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock. “US economic data [have] been falling short of expectations by the largest margin since 2009.”The S&P 500 was in the red for a fourth-straight trading session as geopolitical tensions in Yemen weighed on US stocks.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,056.15, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 17,678.23 and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.3 per cent to 4,863.36.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
51;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-02-09T17:40:40Z;Insead brings online learning to customised courses;Microsoft and Accenture work with Insead to create executive courses for their employees.;Insead has become the latest top-notch business schools to move into online learning, but as befits the business school with the largest full-time MBA programme in the world, it is doing so at scale.According to Peter Zemsky, deputy dean at Insead and dean for strategic initiatives and innovation, it was the hype around Moocs (massive open online courses) in 2012 and 2013 that prompted Insead to look into large-scale online learning. “We were deliberating internally but we couldn’t see the business model [with Moocs],” says Prof Zemsky. “But out of that we had the sense that we could do more things asynchronously.”The school decided that online degrees were not appropriate, says Prof Zemsky, because of the in-classroom interaction that is needed. “In Insead we have this emphasis on cultural diversity, so it didn’t feel right.”Instead they looked at customised executive education. “This is a segment where we are a market leader. It also felt like the right segment to develop the technology.”Professors wanted to educate the people who never get a chance to study on campus, says Prof Zemsky. “This looked like a really big blue ocean opportunity for Insead,” he adds, in a wry reference to the work of his academic colleagues, Renée Mauborgne and W Chan Kim.The result has been that in just a short space of time, Insead has secured two big corporate clients, Microsoft and Accenture.It was early in 2014 that Insead heard of Microsoft’s plans to launch an online programme and its hope of working with a business school to do it. The issue for the technology giant was that as corporations adopted cloud computing, a diminishing amount of the IT spend was going through IT departments, and more through other business departments. As a result, Microsoft’s sales people on the ground had to talk to corporate managers, not just IT departments, says Prof Zemsky.Insead’s first meeting with Microsoft was as recent as April 2014, says Prof Zemsky, but the two signed a contract in May, filmed the online video components in June, edited the course in July, beta tested it in August and launched in October. Microsoft closed enrolment once 1,000 sales people were signed up.One of the biggest concerns for Insead professors was whether the participants would be motivated to complete the course. Of the 1,000 enrolled, 850 went the distance, a vast improvement on the completion rates of participants on Moocs and many forms of online learning.Insead is now developing a strategy programme using similar technology for Accenture. The professional services firm wants all its consultants to have the same understanding of what strategy is all about, says Bruno Berthon, managing director for Accenture Strategy, France & Benelux. “We want to create a common philosophy and language across the group.”The decision to work with Insead was because of its strength in global strategy, says Mr Berthon, as well as the business school’s flexibility and level of customisation. “One of the things we wanted to do was to leverage our own team in the delivery of the programme.”The Accenture programme, which will be taught through the firm’s Strategy College, is still at the pilot phase, with eight out of the proposed 24 hours already in the can. Beta testing will begin in April, with the programme deployed in two waves over the next 18 months. A thousand managers will be the first to experience the Insead course in June, with a further 2,000 managers following suit shortly afterwards.Mr Berthon believes the virtual programme will bring additional benefits. “It’s a great way to help people learn to work remotely and collaborate remotely.”Prof Zemsky says Insead is now looking at how it can work with its professors to bring their work online and also how to work with the career development office to help students get a step up in the job search. “We’re still getting a sense of how far we can push the technology,” he says. “We are in very early days.”
52;ACN;Accenture Plc;2015-01-28T10:14:11Z;The digi-teens: the next generation switches on;The next generation switches on and appreciates the digital difference to their lives;Employers seem to have been complaining for ever that the latest batches of university and school leavers are not equipped for the world of work — a message reinforced by the CBI’s annual survey in December saying the lack of skills was a big concern to bosses.Over the years, the demand for specific talents — from plastering and plumbing, decent spelling and grammar, to science, technology, engineering and mathematics — may have changed, but the call for people to have the right skills has not.And now, according to the research from Accenture highlighted in the graphic below, it seems as if parents and children are making the same demands. These findings are in tune with the times. In November, the CBI and the Trades Union Congress jointly backed a “statement of priorities” on skills that was published by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, a government-funded organisation. Better skills, the CBI and TUC say, will help the economy prosper and lift workers out of low-wage conditions.
53;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:30:00+0000;Poland draws big banks for ‘nearsourcing’;Multinational companies build up a back-office presence closer to home in EU backyard;With its quaint 13th-century market square, meandering canals and botanical gardens, Wroclaw bears little resemblance to the glass and steel-clad banking districts of London, New York or Frankfurt.But the western Polish city is emerging as one of Europe’s most important financial hubs as investment pours in to the country’s outsourcing industry. Poland is beginning to challenge India as the financial services industry’s preferred location for back-office functions.Credit Suisse, UBS and BNY Mellon are planning to add 3,000 workers to their Polish operations over the course of 18 months, according to two people briefed on the banks’ plans.Thousands more back-office roles are forecast to be created in the EU’s sixth-largest economy as their global banking rivals follow suit. Last May, Poland’s Association of Business Service Leaders estimated that employee numbers in the business services sector could rise by a third in just 20 months, to reach 170,000 by the end of 2015.“This year, we will add 15,000 to 20,000 new jobs in this sector,” says Jacek Levernes, ABSL president, “and roughly 5,000 will come from the financial industry”. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on their exact hiring plans, but BNY Mellon confirmed it is planning a headcount increase of 450 in Poland.This increased investment from western companies has helped Poland become the world’s third-largest outsourcing market after China and India — seeing off competition from Brazil and the Philippines.Already, Royal Dutch Shell runs more than $1tn of cash transactions each year through its offices in Krakow in southern Poland. Similarly, Procter & Gamble runs its entire logistics and supply chain operation for Europe out of Warsaw. The capital city is also the base for Citigroup’s global anti-money laundering operation.For western companies, the attraction of outsourcing to Poland is the chance to cut costs without cutting expertise.170,000Estimate of workforce by the end of 2015Banks, law firms and multinational conglomerates that two decades ago realised the huge cost savings to be made by moving call centres to India now want their outsourcing operations to carry out more complex tasks — and see the advantages of locating them closer to their western headquarters.By doing so, companies can continue to operate under the EU’s legal and regulatory framework, and their executives in London and other capitals can reach their outsourced operations in two hours if things go wrong. Delhi, by contrast, is a nine-hour flight away.In fact, as more western companies have chosen Poland and other eastern European countries as outsourcing destinations, they have renamed the practice “nearsourcing”.“There are certain things that you cannot offshore to places like India,” argues Mr Levernes. “The people that you need are easier to find and overall cost the same as in places like India over the long run.”Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, is also taking advantage of Poland’s competitive labour costs as it continues to face pay disputes in Germany. The US company opened three fulfilment centres near the border in Western Poland — despite not having a retail presence in the country.Continue readingAdvocates of nearshoring contend that young Poles are better educated, boast more professional skills and have a wider European language proficiency than their Asian rivals — but are still much cheaper to employ than university graduates in Germany, the UK or the US.“It is actually more expensive to set up a team that can, say, speak 10 different languages and handle complex projects in Bangalore or Gurgaon than Wroclaw or Kracow,” says Mr Levernes.Demand for Polish back-office staff has accelerated since the financial crisis and enabled the country’s outsourcing industry to grow by an average of 20 per cent a year for the past five years, according to ABSL.“This is the biggest and most exciting industry in eastern Europe,” said Hadley Dean, managing partner for eastern Europe at Colliers International, the real estate firm.Almost half of all the foreign investments in Poland’s outsourcing industry has come from banks, insurance and technology companies — and 90 per cent of all outsourced operations serve western European customers. English and German are the most commonly spoken languages, ABSL says.Much of the investment has been in Poland’s second- and third-tier cities. Lodz, once a thriving textiles producer that fell into rapid decline after the fall of communism, now is home to Accenture, Hewlett-Packard and even India’s own outsourcer Infosys. Between them, the three employ thousands.Simple tasks may well be going to India, but complex business is coming to CEE, and Poland especiallySkanska, a Swedish construction and property development company, says 90 per cent of its business in Poland outside of Warsaw involves buildings for outsourced operations.In the centre of Wroclaw, which is close to the Czech Republic, workers are completing work on the Dominikanski, the largest office building in southwest Poland.More than 85 per cent of the space will be taken by outsourcing operations when it opens its doors and its biggest tenant will be Hewlett-Packard, which employs more than 4,000 people in Poland.“We can see more growth is coming from the clients that are already operating in Poland, as they look to scale up and consolidate their operations,” says Arkadiusz Rudzki, leasing and asset director at Skanska, which is managing the Dominikanski building project. “Simple tasks may well be going to India, but complex business is coming to CEE, and Poland especially.”
54;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-11-21T11:12:23Z;Guest post: EM can join the shale gas revolution;;"By Melissa Stark, AccentureA lot has been written about the shale gas and oil boom in the US and why that model cannot be replicated in other countries with plentiful potential resources. In fact, this does not have to be the case.We have done extensive analysis on the potential for shale development outside of the US, from Western to Eastern Europe, across Asia Pacific, Latin America and even South Africa. The biggest advantage that countries like Argentina, Saudi Arabia and China have over the others is a strong, government-backed national oil company (NOC).NOCs have always done things differently, and this is largely due to their different national objectives as compared to their privately-owned, global, ‘big oil’ peers from Western Europe or North America.To their governments, NOCs are custodians of local resources, securers of supply, revenue collectors, and therefore, engines of growth and national development. They all seek the growth opportunities offered by globalisation and technology, but each also balances these desires with other national priorities. This ability to balance a mix of priorities is why development of unconventional resources, such as shale, will be different under an NOC.Effective and sustainable development of unconventional resources requires operators to invest in the market for the long-term. It requires them to hold enough financial resources to invest in the well density necessary to really understand and develop basins, invest in infrastructure and local supplier development, and work with the local communities to garner support for the development, minimise surface disruption and ensure that the local communities share in the benefits. Another critical factor is working with the government and policy makers to ensure fit for purpose and environmentally sound regulations.In all of the above, an NOC will have an advantage over an international or foreign oil company. It is perhaps no wonder that of the nine basins that we studied globally, the ones that seem to be moving forward with the support of governments and communities are NOC-led.They are the Neuquen basin in Argentina led by YPF, the South Ghawar basin in Saudi Arabia led by Saudi Aramco, and the Sichuan basin in China led by Sinopec.Of all the international basins that we looked at, we believe Argentina will move the fastest.YPF has a number of advantages, including ownership of the majority of the best acreage, which provides access, a type of rock that doesn’t require a lot of technology adaptation, and ownership of the infrastructure and basin experience. Shale development is critical to Argentina’s energy security. YPF has also had success attracting joint venture partners such as Chevron and Petronas. An important factor to watch in Argentina will be the fiscal regime and its ability to continue to attract foreign investment. Overall, a very good bet.In Saudi Arabia’s South Ghawar basin, the world’s biggest oil company, Saudi Aramco, has 100 percent of the acreage and strong government support for shale gas development, as the country focuses on increasing gas supply for domestic power generation. The NOC giant already owns the basin infrastructure, has experience with its geology, and needs the shale gas to grow its natural gas portfolio. It will be challenged by water availability in large-scale development and will need access to US technology and international workforce with experience in shale gas exploration and development. Another one that we’re watching very closely.China’s challenging geology, water scarcity, population density and poor surface condition make development difficult. But the country’s strong NOCs, Sinopec and CNPC, also have some good advantages, such as ownership of the acreage and infrastructure, and experience operating in the Sichuan basin. Sinopec has limited competition from other upstream resources. But perhaps the biggest advantage is strong government support and subsidy regime. With this, we believe that the NOCs will overcome the geology and land access challenges. This also means that Sinopec’s recent Fuling find is incredibly significant. At production rates of 60,000-200,000 cubic metres per day per well, these are comparable to the Marcellus basin in the US.However, this is not to say that it will be easy for NOCs to develop these resources. In fact, they are quite challenged due to their sole experience being in conventional development and they tend to operate in countries where there is not an established workforce with experience in developing shale resources.This is also not to say that all NOCs will move fast on shale. For example, Russia will face challenges around foreign investment, and Mexico, with its opening market and an abundance of conventional resources that are much cheaper and easier to get to than shale; will probably hold fire on unconventionals for now.But we remain optimistic on Argentina, Saudi Arabia and China. Blessed with a resource base, a supportive government, a good relationship with the local communities, and ownership of the infrastructure, these NOCs can move quickly. They also have the opportunity to take a holistic view of basin development. For example, the US basins have a lot of redundant infrastructure and assets – roads, pipelines, water storage close together and separate truck fleets supporting operations close to one another. Very little is shared. An NOC has the opportunity to make the basin more efficient and avoid duplicating infrastructure. Water delivery can be done on a ‘milk run’ model instead of every rig or pad hauling its own.Melissa Stark is the global managing director of Accenture’s new energy business and author of International Development of “Unconventional Resources: if, where and how fast?”Back to beyondbrics"
55;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-11-20T20:04:16Z;Connected cars raise privacy and safety worries;Rush to add cutting-edge technology could be a security minefield;The car used to be one of the purchases that said the most about you. Today, it might be better to think of it as the thing that knows the most about you.Drive a new car out of a showroom and hundreds of sensors, scanners and cameras begin tracking every aspect of your driving, as the car’s communication systems link you to the outside world.These systems make you safer and help you reach your destination more easily. But they also open up previously undreamt of revenue streams for carmakers, insurers and telecoms companies. And they present a privacy and security minefield.“Data transmitted from a connected car could tell someone a lot about the driver,” says Prasad Satyavolu, head of innovation at Cognizant Technology Solutions. “How fast [and how well] they drive, where they are, what routes they take, what times they typically drive, even what music they listen to.”Mr Satyavolu, whose company builds connected car systems for a range of manufacturers, says: “There are benefits to carmakers and insurers from the data, but with consumers more aware of data privacy than ever, it is important that there is transparency on which data are shared, with whom and why.”Electronics appeared on the dashboard in the 1930s with the first in-car radio and cassette players arriving 30 years later. General Motors introduced emergency services monitoring systems in 1996, while satellite capability first appeared commercially in the 1980s.Today’s cars can boast iPad applications, full mobile communication systems, and technology that allows for complete remote monitoring of telemetry and component status, such as engine temperature or reporting a broken windscreen wiper.That means drivers can check their emails, stream music, call home and spot the nearest McDonald’s, while also benefiting from safety alerts, fuel efficient route recommendations and automated scheduling of parts servicing.A car thief can open some of the most modern cars just by using a computer and radio equipmentGM is now leading the rollout of camera technology that can track eye movements and spot distracted drivers, while Ford is close to commercialising car seats that detect potential heart attacks.Having access to data from cars could be lucrative for almost all in the automotive revenue chain. Carmakers could use in-car data to see which functions are used and those that are ignored, helping them fine-tune future features.Insurance companies could find out how safely cars are driven, or tailor policies according to how often a car is serviced. The number of insurance policies in the UK tied to telematics, or a monitoring device in the car, trebled between 2011 and 2013 to 300,000.Advertisers could also use time and route information to discover what offers would be most relevant to drivers.“As long as consumers have the ability to opt in and can see the benefits of sharing their data, and manufacturers are putting in place measures to anonymise and store data safely, then it should be down to the individual to determine the line between cost savings and their data use,” says Mr Satyavolu.The demand seems to be strong. According to a survey of developed car markets by Accenture, 56 per cent of drivers would like to read and dictate emails while at the wheel and 52 per cent want cars that identify traffic signals, accidents and traffic congestion.The pace of innovation – and a race between carmakers to be seen as the most cutting-edge – has pushed forward the implementation of always-connected technologies into today’s cars, while regulators have encouraged their adoption for safety reasons.The EU has implemented rules mandating the installation of an “eCall” system in new cars by the end of 2015, which wirelessly sends airbag impact sensor data with GPS information to emergency services if there is a crash.The eCall system will mean that wireless information gathering tools will be installed in almost 7m cars in Europe by 2016, according to research from the GSM Association of mobile telecom companies.The other side of the boom in wireless communication technology in cars concerns security. Hackers have shown that communication systems, such as tyre sensors, can be accessed and used to control other parts of the vehicle.“Currently, there is little or no security in cars,” says Gary Newe, director of field systems engineering at F5 Networks, a data networking and security company. “A car thief can open some of the most modern cars without a key, just by using a computer and radio equipment.”He adds: “The fact we are starting to connect these cars to the internet, and share data between consumers, manufacturers and others, should concern everyone.”
56;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Healthcare market opens with few hitches;Affordable Care Act still faces political and legal challenges;The Obama administration’s healthcare marketplace opened without a major hitch at the weekend, avoiding the website crashes that delivered a serious setback to the president’s signature reforms last year.Thousands of Americans began signing up for health insurance on HealthCare.gov as its second annual enrolment period opened on Saturday, with reports of login problems and helpline backlogs but no serious technical failures.The fact that the federal website seems to have passed a crucial test will prompt relief at the White House, but it does not defuse two graver threats to Mr Obama’s landmark healthcare reforms. They come from the Supreme Court and a Republican-controlled Congress.The US Supreme Court this month agreed to hear a potentially destructive legal challenge to government subsidies – which take the form of tax credits – that are vital to enabling millions of people to afford private insurance from the marketplace.At the same time Republicans, emboldened by a resounding victory in congressional elections, are gearing up to use their control of both chambers of Congress to try to repeal parts of the healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act.As a result the Obama administration is being dragged back into old fights over the law, drowning out its message about the benefits of requiring all Americans to hold insurance and making it affordable.The administration has forecast that up to 9.9m people will enrol in so-called Obamacare health plans for 2015, although that is 3m fewer than congressional budget analysts had predicted previously.The White House hired Accenture to overhaul the online marketplace at a cost of $175m after it jettisoned CGI, a Canadian tech company that bore some of the blame for last year’s high-profile glitches.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who oversees the system as secretary of health and human services, said 100,000 people completed online applications on the first day of enrolments.During the first day of enrolment last year only six people managed to complete the process as the website buckled under the strain of users. It remained a technical disaster for several weeks afterwards.Many of those signing up for health insurance received the government subsidies that are being challenged in the Supreme Court case.A court ruling in favour of the plaintiffs could take subsidies away from more than 4m Americans, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a think-tank.At issue is whether the law allows the federal government to give subsidies to people in 34 states that have opted out of establishing their own exchanges, leaving citizens to instead buy on the federal marketplace.Timothy Jost, an advocate of healthcare reform at Washington and Lee University, said blocking the subsidies would destabilise the finances of some local insurance markets, because many healthy people would stop buying coverage, but sick – and thus more expensive – customers would keep theirs.“The consequence would be that individual markets in many states could collapse or be severely threatened,” he said.I think our guys would shed nary a tear if all that work went to naught and it was goneTo make matters worse for the White House, Republicans have seized on a video that surfaced last week showing an architect of the policy saying it passed because of a lack of transparency over its funding and the “stupidity of the American voter”.That has given fresh momentum to a Republican campaign to pick apart the healthcare law, using their newly won control of the Senate and their tightened grip on the House of Representatives.Republican leaders say they still want to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act and many big companies would be relieved to see it go, even though they have spent many dollars and hours preparing to comply with key parts of it by January 1, 2015.“I think our guys would shed nary a tear if all that work went to naught and it was gone,” said Neil Trautwein, a healthcare specialist at the National Retail Federation, a trade group with many members that sponsor employee coverage.A full repeal, however, is improbable. Republicans have a better chance of passing bills to undo the law’s least popular provisions and then sending them to Mr Obama – who would have to decide whether to veto them or not.Their chief targets are the twin “mandates” that require companies to give full-time employees health insurance and require all Americans to have health coverage of one form or another.But Republicans still need a few Democratic votes to pass bills in the Senate and they will struggle to recruit allies from across the political aisle to roll back central parts of the law.Republicans will have a better chance of narrowing the definition of a full-time worker so it includes fewer employees, a change that retailers, restaurants and other employers of low-wage workers are desperate to see.The best prospect for bipartisan action is on repealing a tax on medical devices such as pacemakers, which is embedded in the law. It is projected to raise $29bn in revenue over 10 years to fund the expansion of health coverage, but critics say it is hobbling an industry that is meant to help the sick in other ways.Repealing it, however, would create a funding hole that would need to be filled.
57;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-11-10T20:01:11Z;Dissolving of boundaries lets in more consultancy competitors;The industry is having to adapt as technological changes redraw the landscape;When Grant Thornton wanted to devise its latest global strategy, the accounting and advisory group did not call in a team from McKinsey or Bain. It organised a 72-hour online “jam” for its 38,500 staff worldwide.“It was essential to us that we didn’t present a strategy that was done in a darkened room by people sitting round a table,” says Francesca Lagerberg, head of people and culture, who describes the September jam as “like Facebook on speed”.When a new chief executive wanted to shake up Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust last year, he asked his 16,000 employees to create a new template for the hospitals’ values, vision and objectives, using a process devised by crowdsourcing specialist Clever Together.The trust had used traditional consultants before, but Peter Thomond, Clever Together’s managing partner, says that while the outcomes of staff consultations are “not as pretty or as slick” as consultancy strategy documents, “thousands of people write them and the buy-in is massive”. The exercise helped the trust come up with a five-year strategy and a leadership framework called “the Leeds Way”.Sometimes it seems as though we are all consultants now. The scale, scope and sophistication of networking tools allows organisations to collect ideas and disseminate the results of consultations easily and cheaply.Many executives are either former consultants, who have fanned out from temples of strategy to run organisations worldwide, or MBA-holders imbued with theoretical and practical knowledge of management. By combining analytical tools, social media and their own expertise, they can afford to be choosier about when they hire consultants and what they pay them for.The fast-changing nature of business has also made it harder for consulting groups to sell the same strategic frameworks to clients as they used to, as a group of McKinsey consultants, academics and corporate heads of strategy acknowledged in a debate for the 50th anniversary edition of McKinsey Quarterly, published this autumn.Michael Jacobides of London Business School told the Quarterly: “When the environment changes profoundly, the maps with which we navigate it may need to shift as well. For instance, from telco to healthcare to computers, sector boundaries are changing or dissolving, and new business models are redefining the competitive landscape.”The same deep changes affecting consultants’ clients are affecting the consultancies themselves. That is one explanation for the consolidation at the top of the consulting industry. PwC completed its acquisition of Booz & Co (rebranded Strategy&) this year. Significant acquisition activity also takes place below the radar of daily headline news, where large groups such as Deloitte continue to absorb dozens of boutique companies annually, expanding their expertise.Smaller consulting groups see opportunity in the changing landscape, too. “Whenever you shift the players in the game, [clients] think: ‘How can I play differently?’,” says Liann Eden, founding partner of Eden McCallum, which operates what it calls a “pure consulting” model, bringing together bespoke teams of independent consultants to tackle clients’ specific needs.The movement could be characterised as a combination of shift and drift. As demand for some services declines or margins diminish, companies, forced to move into new areas, shift their own position deliberately, or drift into adjacent areas involuntarily.At the same time, competition both for business – and for deals – is increasing between consulting groups and companies from outside the sector that realise they can offer their industrial expertise as a service.For example, Cardinal Health, originally a US pharmaceuticals distributor, made a calculated decision to move into management consulting for hospitals, building on its knowledge of healthcare supply chains and regulations.Advertising agencies are making use of their knowledge of digital media – and their deep network of corporate customers – to compete with traditional consultants in selling advice about the digital revolution. Publicis’ purchase of the consultancy Sapient, announced last week, will further blur the distinction between the two sectors.Technological change is a battleground to which most consultants have shifted resources in recent years. Rich Lesser, chief executive of the Boston Consulting Group, established BCG Digital Ventures in January to “help clients build digital products and services”.The company-within-a-company is staffed by what BCG calls a “multidisciplinary group of professionals”.At almost exactly the same time, Accenture established Accenture Strategy with 8,000 consultants (out of a workforce of 305,000), half of whom are technology strategists and half business strategists. Andy Tinlin, head of Accenture Strategy in the UK, says its consultants’ role has “evolved from being either an adviser or an implementer to being much more a hybrid of the two”.The technological challenges consultants face are ‘the four horsemen of the apocalypse’Companies such as BCG, McKinsey and Bain, among the traditional “strategy houses”, tend not to talk publicly of large technology-based groups such as Accenture and IBM as direct competitors, and vice versa. But it is no surprise that such cross-disciplinary and hybrid teams are proliferating, and starting to bump into each other in the field.Perhaps only when the tag “digital” is so ubiquitous that it becomes superfluous will it be possible to assess which companies have the best skills and model for the new world.Tom Rodenhauser, managing director of advisory services at Kennedy Consulting Research & Advisory, describes the technological challenges consultants face as “the four horsemen of the apocalypse”: social media, cloud services, analytics and mobility. But they represent an opportunity as well as a challenge. The fact people are increasingly active on social networks and via mobile devices is as much a societal as a technological transformation. It goes to the heart of how businesses operate.“When consultants talk about digitisation, what they are really asking is: how are these phenomena affecting the way businesses operate and how can consultants facilitate that? And I don’t know whether they have the answer,” says Mr Rodenhauser.Even if they do not, they have little to worry about for now. Figures collated by Kennedy for its 2014 Global Consulting Forecast show revenue growth overall accelerated from 3.7 per cent in 2013 to 4.6 per cent this year. A resurgence in merger and acquisition activity and advice, information technology integration and cyber security consulting, and strategy and operations work related to companies’ growth initiatives, has pushed annual revenues in the industry towards $247bn.The Big Four accountants-turned-advisory-groups show some of the strongest growth in the top 10 consultancies – a sign perhaps that their bet on becoming large-scale one-stop shops is paying off.No wonder that against this backdrop of growth in standard consulting services, innovative developments such as crowd-sourced strategy-making seem to pose little threat. BCG’s Mr Lesser says consultants can still offer “deep understanding of economics and competitive advantage, customer needs and rapid technology evolution in many sectors. I don’t see crowdsourcing being able to implement that in a world of resource constraints and intense global competition”. To be fair, neither do the crowdsourcers themselves.Ms Lagerberg says that once Grant Thornton has examined the outcome of its “jam”, “we may go back to some of these traditional consultants to say: ‘We want you to help us achieve this’”.Similarly, Mr Thomond at Clever Together says the business world is “always going to need super-high-end brains to solve super-complex problems”. He adds: “We’re not here to eat [consultants’] lunch, we’re here to eat some of the crumbs off the table.”Yet all those nibbling at the growing consulting pie are hungry for more.
58;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-11-10T20:01:11Z;Opinion divided over consulting firms’ dedicated online teams;Some companies see ‘digital’ units as innovative, others dismiss them as marketing hype with little strategic value;As companies feel the impact of digital developments on their brands, consulting firms are forming internal teams or acquiring young specialist businesses to create dedicated online units.Firms need significant alliances, says Paul Connolly, director of the Management Consultancies Association Think Tank, particularly with technology, social media or digital companies.“They don’t wear a collar and tie, appear corporate or look at home in a consulting firm,” he says. “They are a bit different and don’t necessarily fit a standardised corporate mould. They think differently and have different perspectives.”It is a question of translating “the radical implications of something potentially amorphous and intangible that is only recognisable by its works”, Mr Connolly adds. “They can turn it into financial, recruitment or business model implications that the captains of industry can get their heads around. There is a continuing role for those with a respectable, high brand value.”Deloitte Digital was set up in April, 2014. It brought together people from across the firm, including experts in design and art.“The digital arm of an organisation needs to speak with a different voice, to address the changing online world,” says Royston Seaward, a partner at Deloitte Digital. “The idea is not to move away from ‘Deloitte’, but rather to establish a slightly different brand and team that is associated with an edgy, innovative way of working.”However, Pat Sullivan, research vice-president at Gartner, the analysts, is sceptical about the rebranding efforts of many firms. “Repositioning is easy from a marketing perspective,” he says. “They can aggregate and combine businesses and put on the ‘digital’ label, but they are not changing what they do, how they do it or their business model. It really is marketing hype right now, rather than a reality of fundamentally changing things.”We think ‘digital’ is pervasive, so why separate it from the rest of the firm?Other firms are making no specific response or changes, asserting that digital has never been a separate issue and has always been central to all their work. “We think ‘digital’ is pervasive, so why separate it from the rest of the firm?” says John Levell, EY’s UK and Ireland head of digital.“It is easy to get distracted by attractive digital ‘packaging’ of a standalone function,” he says. “But putting a team into a little box on its own can make it more difficult to take a properly holistic perspective when it comes to delivering sustainable outcomes for clients. Our values and culture already sustain a high level of diversity and skills, which really supports the creativity and innovation that digital requires.”Digital certainly requires a wider range of skills than firms have traditionally had available internally, hence the move to acquire some of the younger, more nimble companies specialising in tech and media.Donald Shields, head of digital transformation at Cognizant in the UK, explains that the online challenge was originally seen as an add-on to existing brand communications, so working with a small digital agency was all that was required.Consumer behaviour, however, has since been totally transformed by the online world, so the digital strategy of a business is often fundamental to its overall strategy and goals. “With this increased significance, companies now need partners that can provide more than the traditional consulting services,” he says. “They must offer a wide breadth of digital expertise to help them truly integrate digital with the rest of the business.”The disruptive nature of digital could still have an impact on branding. With a move from advice to providing fully operational specific solutions, new business models will be required. This includes working with clients under different names to produce narrow industry-specific solutions. One example is Accenture setting up Taleris, a joint venture with GE Aviation to help airlines and cargo carriers increase efficiency through data analysis and optimisation.Mr Connolly says digital is a “known unknown” for many clients, which will continue for some time to choose trusted advisory brands to disentangle and demystify it for them.“Members are radical about digital,” he says. “In terms of scale and impact, more than 60 per cent say it is comparable with the industrial revolution.”——————————————-Disruptive technology lies behind growthDigital and technology services increased their share of consulting revenues in the UK by 6 per cent in 2013 and now account for a quarter of income, according to the Management Consultancies Association.While previous growth reflected broader technology trends, this is coming from disruptive technologies, such as social media, the cloud, analytics, mobility and 3D printing.“Digital can be harnessed to create value, but this requires a level of imagination and creativity,” says Alwin Magimay, partner and head of digital and analytics at KPMG.“Successful consulting companies will focus on the network and ecosystem of innovation and start-ups.“The pace of change is accelerating, but there is still some way to go [for digital].”
59;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-11-10T20:01:11Z;Engaging the next generation of talent is the big challenge for consultancy firms;Tech-savvy millennials are in demand but they have their own priorities;"Technological advances and an ageing workforce are changing the nature of work – and with it the recruitment patterns of the UK’s main consultancies.Critical to most workplaces is encouraging diversity – and moving away from the perceived homogeneity of the past.Paul Connolly, director of the Management Consultancies Association Think Tank, comments: “Our corporate boardrooms, typically overstuffed with middle-aged 50-something males, need to acquaint themselves with people who have extremely valuable skills, but who don’t necessarily wear a collar and tie, aren’t necessarily Oxbridge.“However, they can inject some benign bacillus into the analyst-stuffed realms of corporate life.”While combined audit revenues for the Big Four professional service firms have shrunk by $5bn over the past five years, consulting business is booming, with an increase in revenues of $16.1bn over the same period.Growth in digital services – big data, cyber security, mobile applications – is at the forefront of the consulting charge, and it is resourcing technology and digital practices that keeps most talent managers awake at night.“The business I am responsible for only came into existence in January and now has 28,000 people,” says Mike Sutcliff, group chief executive of Accenture Digital. “They were all doing something else two years ago.”The millennials– those born between 1980 and 1995 – are a key demographic and one of the main targets for recruitment, but what they want in return is shifting.“Attracting the next generation is the big challenge,” adds Mr Sutcliff. “There are not enough people with the Stem– science, technology, engineering and mathematics – skills we need in lots of countries and at all skill levels. It is getting harder to find all the people we need in all these categories.”Simon Collins, UK chairman and senior partner at KPMG, sees a difference in the millennial generation’s priorities. “They are considerably more thoughtful about work: they want to know why they are doing it and that it will make a difference,” he says.“They are less interested in hierarchical progression and more interested in working on really cool things,” says Stevan Rolls, UK head of human resources at Deloitte. “Having meaning and control in the work that you do is critical for this generation.”The importance of consulting firms’ social brands, particularly for this generation of digital natives, “cannot be underestimated”, adds Carl Smith, global talent leader for EY’s advisory business. “What you do when no one is looking is what ends up being communicated round the world.”Consulting groups are also facing increasing competition for staff from big technology companies. “Google and Apple are like the Foreign Office of the 1970s,” says Mr Collins.All consulting firms are looking at creative approaches to recruitment, from school-leaver programmes to flexible working options for older staff.Having meaning and control in the work that you do is critical for this generationPA Consulting, which has its own innovation centre that creates technology products as well as consulting services, is looking at offering its own technology apprenticeships, says Lesley Uren, a talent management expert with PA Consulting. “We are flirting with this at the moment.”“We are already seeing some of our alumni working more flexibly,” says Mr Rolls, “but retaining their contact with the firm. There is a cadre of people with the skills, the relationships and understanding of the firm that is of real value to the business.”Diversity is a common mantra. “I was terrified we would end up completely homogenising our recruitment in our own image,” says Mr Collins. “Soon everyone has a first or a 2:1 degree, has climbed Kilimanjaro and raised £50,000 for charity by the age of nine.”Age has also become a factor, with many firms reporting an increase in mid-career hires. “We have brought in more people mid-career than historically, but it is always a gamble,” says Ms Uren. “There is about a 50:50 hit rate.”The key is to strike a balance between new and experienced hires, adds Mr Sutcliff, something Accenture Digital attempts to do. “That has definitely changed from when [we] started out and all the recruitment was at graduate level.”Mr Rolls says: “It is incumbent on firms to reach out to their people – men and women – to understand what they want, what they need. If you have these conversations, you are less likely to lose people. It is just good talent management.”But ultimately, there are four main factors that determine whether a person is likely to stay and become a high flyer, explains EY’s Mr Smith.“Someone cares about me; you are investing in my development; walking the talk; and recognition for contribution. When I look at our recruitment and retention, those four things come up consistently.”——————————————-Downturn delivers valuable lessonsRecruitment may be up 16 per cent this year, according to statistics from the UK-based Management Consultancies Association (MCA), but the effects can still be felt of the financial crisis, when promotion opportunities dried up and frustrated high-flyers left to seek new opportunities.“During the financial downturn, not only did some consulting firms shrink, but also the choice of work to do was more limited,” says Lesley Uren, a talent management expert with PA Consulting.Paul Connolly, director of the MCA Think Tank, agrees that this, along with blocked career paths, caused some to flee the profession.“Consultancy slipped into implementation during the downturn, so firms were advising on ‘cutting the grass’ but doing a bit of grass-cutting of their own as well,” he says.Not all groups shrank, however. Martha Samuelson, president and chief executive of Boston-based Analysis Group, says the firm has never had a lay-off in its history.“During the financial crisis we experienced a modest downturn, so as partners we took a decision to absorb it. It’s a cultural thing never to have had a lay-off.”For those groups that did reduce recruitment, lessons have been learnt. “After the experience of the financial crisis, one thing I have vowed is never again to chop off our entry-level recruitment,” says Simon Collins, UK chairman and senior partner at KPMG.“Whatever happens in the economic cycle, chopping off entry-level recruitment simply gives you a problem when the economy starts to recover.”Deloitte, Accenture Digital, Analysis Group, PA Consulting and EY all report having increased their mid-career hires to help fill talent gaps.——————————————-School leavers provide increase in diversityThe twin forces of student debt and grade inflation – the number and proportion of first-class degrees has doubled in a decade – are making university a less obvious choice for UK students in possession of three good A-levels.Consulting firms are expanding their school-leaver programmes to tap into this valuable source of young – and diverse – talent.All the Big Four groups offer school-leaver programmes, but PwC is the only one that offers a non-graduate route into consultancy. The UK firm takes 130 recruits into its school- and college-leaver programme every year – about 10 per cent of its overall entry – from about 2,500 applications.“One of our key drivers is to create more and more varied routes into our profession,” says Kate Awdry, PwC’s school recruitment manager. “It is a business imperative, because not all our clients are 2:1 graduates either.”EY’s Smart Futures programme also focuses on disadvantaged students in the UK’s underprivileged areas. Zoe Onyenuforo, a trainee accountant with EY, joined after a three-week internship via the Brokerage Citylink, a social enterprise.“My school had no links with EY, so without [Brokerage] I would never have known the internship existed,” says Ms Onyenuforo.Ms Awdry says that PwC employs social media and online advertising to publicise its scheme as well as involving current apprentices.“There are no better spokespeople than the people doing it,” she says.Ms Onyenuforo is certainly an advocate for EY’s scheme. “I felt part of the EY family from the day I walked in. I am going to be a chartered accountant aged 23, and there aren’t many people who can say that,” she says.Once accepted, those on school-leaver programmes are as ambitious as their graduate-entry peers. “I have never felt I can’t progress because I am not a Caucasian male,” Ms Onyenuforo adds.“I am taking my career as it comes, but if one day the opportunity arose to become a partner, then why not?”——————————————-Gender gap persists at highest levelsRecent research on women in US management consulting firms finds that just 10 per cent of partners are women.The report, from Source, an information provider that specialises in management consulting, notes that many consulting groups acknowledge that women account for “as much as half their intake”.Some big firms exhibit greater diversity in their partners, however. A survey last year by the National Association for Female Executives found that 18 per cent of KPMG and Accenture partners were women, while EY headed the diversity table with 24 per cent.The Source survey shows there is a strong commercial argument for consulting firms to increase diversity. Nine in 10 clients surveyed said they would like to see more women on consulting teams.Carl Smith, global talent leader for EY’s advisory business, says: “More diverse teams create more dynamic results, but also our clients are more diverse and expect to see diversity.” He says the firm “recently won business against a major competitor because that competitor produced an all-male team while ours was diverse”.Martha Samuelson, president and chief executive of Analysis Group, which specialises in economic data, says firms need to take a long view of an individual’s lifetime career. “You have to be flexible. Having control over your life and your time is important for everybody,” she says. “I started as a part-time employee with three little kids.”“It starts at the top,” says Jacqui Canney, managing director of human resources at Accenture Digital. “Pierre Nanterme [Accenture chief executive] has prioritised the promotion and visibility of women. That cascades down through the organisation.”"
60;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Women in Business – Shruti Malani Krishnan;The MBA graduate from London Business School left consulting for entrepreneurship;"Shruti Malani Krishnan is an MBA graduate of London Business School and director of Powr of You, a personal data marketplace helping people to receive payment for their data while remaining anonymous. She co-founded the start-up in 2013 with her brother Keshav Malani, who joined LBS the year after her.Ms Malani Krishnan grew up in Kolkata, India then moved to California at the age of 14 and went on to study for a degree in economics at the University of California Berkeley. After graduating in 2005, she worked at Accenture for five years, in IT and operations practices, before joining LBS.In her spare time, Ms Malani Krishnan enjoys learning different forms of dance and how to make jewellery and mosaic art.1. Why did you choose to do an MBA?After studying and working for five years in the US, I wanted to attend a top programme outside the US, in a location where I could see myself professionally in the future. So I applied to LBS and the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad and was accepted to both. I decided to attend LBS for two reasons: (1) almost 90 per cent of the class comes from outside the UK – this international diversity is still lacking in US MBAs I feel – and (2) I met a female student at an LBS information session whose experience as an engineer moving into private equity convinced me LBS would be a great match. It was inspiring that she could make that transition.2. What is your favourite memory of business school?I wouldn’t say favourite, but one memory that stands out is when we talked about tax and accounting practices in Turkey, in an 8:15am class and it turned into an interesting discussion. This shows what an international group of students can bring to the table.On a personal note, I enjoyed the evening walks around Regent’s Park with my now husband. We would get into discussions about things like start-up ideas, scientific endeavours and ethics.3. If you could do it all again, what would you do differently?I would probably take more entrepreneurship courses. Starting my MBA, I knew I wanted to go into strategy consulting for three to five years then start my own business, so I focused my coursework on finance and marketing. I missed out on taking entrepreneurship courses because of this, so would love to go back and take those. I have since met the entrepreneurship faculty while working on Powr of You and found their advice extremely useful.4. What would you do if you were dean of a business school for the day?Encourage everyone to at least try starting a business, even if it’s just for fun. It teaches you an incredible amount about the world of business.5. What advice would you give to female MBA graduates?Challenge yourself. Don’t just go for the option that seems safe but ask yourself if the position you are taking on is truly going to be a learning experience or just one where you know you will be comfortable.My advice to everyone in their 20s and 30s, in fact, is that any time you feel you are comfortable in the job/role you are doing, it is time for a change because you are too young to not be pushing yourself to be better.6. Why did you decide to launch Powr of You?Simply put, we saw a disconnect between consumers and brands and a way to connect them that could benefit everyone. All the data we already share online is quite valuable to companies to understand consumer behaviour and preferences so they can tailor both marketing and innovation efforts. With Powr of You, users earn rewards with our revenue share model and get a service to actively manage their online presence. On the other side, our analytics engine churns this data to help brands plug into their consumers’ lives.We are live in beta now on the web and launching our Android app in November so we are focusing on growing the platform at the moment. Helping people unlock the value of personal data can truly transform lives for the better.7. How do you deal with male-dominated environments?I love Shakespeare so an apt quote I always keep in mind is: “This above all. To thine own self be true”. Also, find a mentor who can be your guide, female or male.8. What is your favourite business book?The biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. It is a great read on how one of the greatest minds came about; how creativity wasn’t learned, in his case, but a way of life from pranks as a kid to innovations as chief executive of Apple.9. How do you deal with pressure?Any time I feel overwhelmed, I make a list. It seems to do the trick. Write things down and prioritise. I am in love with the Wunderlist app for that reason.10. What are your top tips for networking?Be genuine. Don’t try to talk to everyone that seems important and ask generic questions. Rather, figure out whom you want to talk to and why you want to talk to them. In business school especially you go to so many different events."
61;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-11-04T08:00:31Z;What consultants say about being a consultant;;I was very lucky to be invited to LinkedIn’s London offices last week, for a consulting employer panel event hosted by MBA Arena, an online community that connects MBAs and employers through storytelling events.The panel included Steven Yurisich, managing director of Accenture, Jack Bertram a partner at McKinsey & Company, and Per Breuer, the global head of HR at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants. And Sandy Khan, founder of the MBA Arena, did a great job of grilling them. She began by telling the MBA students in the room that they should look at the panellists as their buyers. After all, they are the ones who will be buying our talent and skillset.The panellists described their backgrounds and how they landed where they are now. Mr Yurisich surprised most people in the room by talking about his previous business in fashion and how he worked on start-ups as an entrepreneur, while Mr Bertram entertained the room with a story of how he tried to launch a tech-related venture but underestimated how big the internet was going to be.The entrepreneurial spirit was common amongst all the panellists and became a key part of their messages in how to become a successful consultant. Consultants are fact-based, problem-solving people who need to be able to passionately ask questions and find solutions, just like an entrepreneur.Mr Bertram also pointed out that it is crucial to have a personality and expose your “unique fingerprint.” This is not only for when you are put in front of a client but also for when you are interviewing to join a consultancy firm. You need to be able to strike a critical balance between standing out and putting people at ease.The business leaders were accompanied by their senior recruitment and HR partners, who took the opportunity to explain their hiring process to the audience. Then the session wrapped up with some questions from the audience. Nicole Spitalieri an MBA student from Imperial Business School in London, won a one-month premium LinkedIn account for her question: which enterprise / tech transformations do you think most companies need to start thinking about now or in the next five years?Giving her view on the event, Ms Spitalieri said: “I thought it was a fantastic networking event and very well orchestrated… I managed to make a few great contacts (future employers and peers) with whom I believe I will keep in touch.”MBA Arena got the ratio of students to company representatives just right: the event was busy enough to help expand ones network but intimate enough to get generous, personalised, one on one time with the corporate representatives. Instead of exchanging business cards, we swapped LinkedIn profiles as a way to connect. Perhaps this digital business card will be the simpler and easier way to connect to employers in the future – saving a lot of trees.
62;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-09-10T16:35:34Z;Is an EMBA worth its hefty price tag?;;"In October the FT will publish its 2014 Executive MBA magazine and, as part of our research, we would like to hear your thoughts on whether an EMBA is actually worth the thousands of dollars it usually costs. The course at Kellogg / Hong Kong UST Business School, for example – ranked number one in the global 2013 FT EMBA ranking – currently costs $155,000; IE Business School in Spain, ranked number 15, charges $93,354; and fees at the Rotterdam School of Management in the Netherlands, ranked number 48, are $60,085.One of the FT’s MBA bloggers, Ekta Malhotra, considered this in a recent post. A senior strategy manager at Accenture, she invested $149,500 to study on the global Asia programme at London Business School, Hong Kong University Business School and Columbia Business School. To date, she believes it has been worthwhile: “You can’t put a price on experience. Or understanding the corporate finance lexicon,” she says.What are your thoughts? Would you invest in an EMBA or would you prefer to invest in something else – a piece of art work by Banksy, a deposit on an apartment in New York or a journey into space, for example?Comment below, email bized.communities@ft.com or tweet @ftbized #FTranking.

63;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:30:00+0000;South Korea leads in ditching bank branches;;A surge in the popularity of automated banking services in South Korea has slashed the number of people who still use bank branches to a small minority, encouraging industry restructuring.According to a Bank of Korea research report, only 11.2 per cent of South Koreans used branches as of June, compared with 88.8 per cent using automated channels such as ATMs, internet banking and mobile banking.South Korean people’s shift to non face-to-face channels is remarkable when compared to the leading industrialised economies such as the UK, in which 52 per cent of customers still used branches as of July 2014, according to Accenture.In fact, the percentage of UK customers using branches has surged from 43 per cent in 2011, presenting tough questions for banks as they look to balance digital channels with costly branch networks and deliver relevant services. Meanwhile, 13 per cent of South Korean customers used bank branches in December 2011.“South Korean banks tend to offer more banking services via non face-to-face channels than foreign banks do,” says Kim Jeong-hyuk, a team leader at BOK’s payment and settlement team.“The necessity of going to branches is decreasing since South Korean customers are able to use almost the same services by non face-to-face channels such as ATM, internet banking or telebanking.”South Korea’s local lenders are reacting quickly to the trend, slimming down their branches to cut costs and redoubling their focus on digital banking.Foreign banks such as Standard Chartered announced plans to shutter up to 50 branches by the end of the year, while Citibank Korea already shut down and consolidated 56 branches this year. Domestic lenders are also cutting costs by running consolidated branches, which offer not only banking services but also securities, insurance and asset management services at the same time.Shinhan Financial Group with Shinhan Bank currently runs 25 consolidated branches while KB Financial Group with Kookmin Bank runs 10 of them.The South Korean government is also trying to keep up with the trend by establishing banks specialised in internet banking services. According to South Korea’s Financial Services Commission on July 24, the government recognises the necessity of establishing banks specialised in the internet banking services in this digital age.“The government should review related law deterring establishment of specialized banks. The process of real name confirmation system should be reviewed and revised. According to the current law, people only can open their bank account when they visit the branches,” says Cheon Dae-joong, a senior researcher at Woori Finance Research Institute.“Local banks also need to take a look at the examples of Japanese or French banks that already run banks specialised in internet banking services and learn lessons from this,” he added.Back to beyondbrics
64;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-07-21T11:16:29Z;Tech Beat: The new Markits;;"Market infrastructure providers are providing venture capital to start-ups as senior banking executives accept a radical approach to technology may be the only way to survive in their present form.A triple whammy of tougher regulation, low volumes and ever-rising fixed costs are forcing senior executives in banks to accept substantial change, potentially opening the capital markets to changes from which it has hitherto been immune.Big trends such as cloud computing and open source technology have had limited impact on capital markets. Last year the US Securities and Exchange Commission, looking to crunch large volumes of data, opted for an industry that is ahead of anything Silicon Valley could muster.The global investment market, known as “fintech”, has tripled in the past five years to nearly $3bn, according to research from Accenture in March. But as the consultancy pointed out, most has gone into banking, electronic and mobile payments and lending companies.Consequently in recent months Deutsche Börse, Europe’s largest bourse, and CME Group, the US futures exchange, have announced venture funds to encourage ideas.“The idea is to harness the power of entrepreneurship and the rapid pace of technological advancement to grow our industry and our business,” said Mark Fields, managing director of CME’s Strategic Investment Group, at the time of launch.Hopefuls could one day emulate companies such as Markit, the UK data provider worth $5bn, and IntercontinentalExchange, one of the world’s largest exchanges operators by market value.Both were founded in the rush of money and creativity of the dotcom boom. The former was conceived as an online collector and distributor of credit data. ICE started out as an eBay for energy trading.Bob Gach, global capital markets managing director at Accenture, says there are parallels with today's market, with layers of tough regulation, as found in Dodd-Frank and Basel III, providing the incentive to create more mini-Markits.“Years ago the incentive was on creating trading platforms like ICE and FxAll [now owned by Thomson Reuters]. The regulation will help see that grow; it will be attractive for people in the banks to create these apps. At the same time, it’s creating a virtuous circle in the banks willing to look at innovation,” he says.Among the hottest areas for start-ups are helping banks manage reference data, collateral and know-your-customer requirements, and Mr Gach said the post-crisis push to standardise the tags attached to trades on the world’s markets would be key.“If you look at other innovations, when the standard was created, it starts a lot of innovation. Legal Entity Identifiers are changing everything,” he said.But those hopefuls who harbour ambitions face a different set of challenges to start-ups in other parts of the economy – ones that require more than an app at the Apple Store.Banks and exchanges are heavily regulated – in part to protect the customer information that a full corporate overhaul would endanger. Understanding legal requirements requires specialist knowledge, often from insiders.As a result, the number of people who can open doors is more limited. “Your average UK venture capital firm knows very little about capital markets outside payments. It’s still quite an open space, though patience is required. Getting your foot in the door is the most challenging thing,” says Matt Wreford, who used to head the private investment company of Michael Spencer, founder of interdealer broker ICAP. He is now chief executive and co-founder of Vernier Partners, a Californian fintech start-up.Even then it can be a struggle. “When you’re trying to set up a business, you’ve got to have another client as an anchor,” says Stu Taylor, chief executive of Algomi, a start-up trying to get banks to manage their in-house bond liquidity trades. “Once you have that, you risk money on an idea. The biggest problem is inertia.”Big names such as CME and Deutsche Börse are offering a helping hand. For them the example of ICE and Markit has shown the rewards for taking stakes in the winners.Inevitably many hopefuls will fail and consolidate. Nevertheless, as Mr Wreford points out: “Once you have built a business that is at the heart of the core market infrastructure, it’s a very resilient place to be.”"
65;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-07-13T21:30:20Z;Students opt for internships with impact;MBAs increasingly want to use their management knowledge and skills to make a social difference;Creating marketing plans for Afghan artisans, enhancing nutrition in African food and developing healthcare in the Middle East are not traditional MBA summer jobs. Business school students, however, are increasingly interested in careers where they can “have an impact”, spurring organisations in the public and private sectors to provide internship opportunities.“The increase in interest is a combination of the crisis on Wall Street in recent years and MBAs having an interest in development situations where they can see the impact of what they are doing,” says Elam Muchira, who is responsible for MBA recruitment at the International Finance Corporation in Washington.Social causesMr Muchira says MBA internship applications to the IFC, the private sector investment arm of the World Bank, increased to 1,300 this year, up from 1,100 in the same period of 2013. In addition, postgraduate job applications more than doubled to 2,600 in 2014 from 1,200 the year before.Orla Mc Gouran, co-president of the Net Impact Club at London Business School, says her group is one of the fastest growing on campus. The LBS chapter of Net Impact, the non-profit organisation that supports social and environmental causes, has 1,945 members, a 77 per cent rise from 2010.Ms Mc Gouran previously worked for corporations in marketing and development. “I wanted an MBA to do something different and look at how to increase access to healthcare in places such as Africa and the Middle East,” she says. This summer she will work as an intern on Healthbox’s Social Innovators Programme in London, focusing on social enterprises in the healthcare technology sector.InternshipsChristine Driscoll Goulay, associate director of Insead’s Social Entrepreneurship Initiative, says there has been a noticeable increase in MBAs wanting internships in social entrepreneurship and impact investing.Many of the “doing good” internships are on a voluntary basis, however, making them difficult for MBA students bearing large business school debt to consider. To help students who want impact-related internships Insead has launched a social stipend programme, sponsored by student clubs, the development office and alumni.Shoshana Stewart, chief executive of Turquoise Mountain charity, plans to hire her first MBA intern because of a newly developed donor sponsorship with LBS. Her organisation works to revive Afghanistan’s traditional crafts. “I need business expertise to try to scale up the Afghan craft industry, increase sales in the next five years and build a strategic sales and marketing plan,” she says.However, when moving between the international public sector and the commercial world, MBAs have to make a cultural adjustment. Martyn Dicker, director of human resources at Fairtrade Foundation, the charity that helps disadvantaged producers in developing countries, says interns have to learn how to be more innovative without access to the same technology that they would have in the private sector.“MBAs need to see how collaborative this sector is,” he says. “They have to speak to people and genuinely understand them and not gather official data on a computer and think that is enough.”Recruitment opportunitiesInternships are valuable recruiting opportunities for organisations. Accenture, the global management consulting company, finds its not-for-profit wing, Accenture Development Partnerships, attracts many MBAs.It also offers ADP secondment work to employees during their ongoing employment. “We are overwhelmed with demand,” says Louise James, managing director at ADP. “They really want a career with social impact and economic impact and they believe in the role the private sector has to play in access to electricity or healthcare, education and other international development issues.”
66;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-06-26T16:28:28Z;Rebound in demand lifts Accenture;;Accenture, the global technology and outsourcing company, reported solid performance on Thursday driven by a rebound in demand for its consulting services.Net revenues increased 7 per cent to $7.74bn in the three months to May 31, beating the company’s guided range of $7.4bn to $7.65bn.Consulting net revenues increased 6 per cent to $4.09bn, while outsourcing net revenues were up 10 per cent to $3.65bn. Earnings per share increased 11 per cent to $1.26.The rebound in demand for consulting services marks a turnround from the previous quarter, when profits fell 39 per cent to $722m and the company warned it was having difficulty passing higher costs on to clients.In a call with analysts in March, executives had said they still saw the “consulting business being flattish to low-single-digit positive”.Pierre Nanterme, Accenture’s chairman and chief executive, said revenue growth was business wide.“We are leveraging our unique positioning at the intersection of business and technology, capturing new opportunities in key growth areas – especially digital – and investing to further differentiate our capabilities,” he said.Accenture provides management consulting, technology services and outsourcing to clients globally.Within the digital realm, there are opportunities for the company to work with businesses to capture fresh approaches to targeting consumers, beyond traditional media.On Wednesday, Indian insurance company HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company said it had signed a multiyear outsourcing contract with Accenture for the company to maintain and upgrade its web portals and mobile applications and help adapt its sales strategy.Opportunities are also arising for computer services and IT consulting companies with the growth of cloud computing.John Witt, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, said: “As companies move their systems to the cloud there’s likely to be higher velocity of work but the contracts themselves will be smaller.”Operating income for the quarter was $1.18bn compared with $1.14bn for the third quarter last year.During the three-month period Accenture made $4.3bn of consulting new bookings and $4.5bn of outsourcing new bookings.All five of Accenture’s operating groups saw sales increase year over year and, in geographic terms, the Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment led the way with a 13% sales increase.Accenture said it expected net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $7.45bn to $7.70bn.
67;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-06-08T23:07:07Z;Management consultants go digital to profit from growth;;"Britain’s management consultants are turning themselves into digital specialists to profit from companies gearing up for growth as the economy expands.Members of the Management Consultancies Association saw their fee income rise by 8 per cent to £4.8bn in 2013, the fastest growth rate for six years, according to data released on Monday.Recruitment has also surged, up by 16 per cent to a total of 35,000 consultants in MCA member firms. The number of digital management consultants was up by 115 per cent to 8,000.“The industry is changing from one which was about cost-cutting and enabling companies to survive the ravages of the downturn, to a more optimistic growth scenario,” said Alan Leaman, chief executive.The MCA said members were reporting full order books and strong prospects this year. If that continued, they could be double-digit growth in revenue. Last year income growth was nearly five times the economy’s 1.7 per cent growth rate and follows a 7 per cent rise in 2012. The MCA represents more than 60 per cent of the industry, including the big four accounting firms.Digital and technology services accounted for a quarter of consulting revenues, up by six percentage points on 2012. The growth in digital consultants was achieved by recruitment, including acquisitions of small tech-savvy firms, and redeploying some existing staff.“Some of our firms like Hitachi Consulting, IBM, CSC and Accenture you would expect to have a presence within digital and technology anyway, but we are seeing it right across the consulting industry,” said Paul Connolly, director of the MCA’s think-tank.He said much of the work involved advising boards on how to use technology to create new products and services or ways of selling them.One successful example has been IBM’s work for carmaker Jaguar Land Rover to create the “JLR Virtual Experience”, a way of persuading clients to buy a car without physically touching or driving it.It aims to meet the trend for “personalisation” of products. With carmakers offering an ever-wide range of models with variations of engine size and equipment levels, customers can rarely now just walk into a showroom and find what they want, ready to drive.The Virtual Experience enables a customer at a dealership to configure the car he or she wants on a laptop or iPad. The 3D result is then projected at close to life-size on a 3 x 2 metre screen.The customer can walk around the car and, using either hand gestures or touchscreen technology, open doors, lift the bonnet and even start the engine and get an authentically replicated exhaust noise.Another example is Deloitte’s work for John Lewis, the retailer, to replace its online platform with a new Oracle system without any drop in sales. That was achieved and John Lewis reached its £1bn-a-year online sales target a year ahead of plan.Financial services continued to contribute the largest share of MCA members’ fee income from the private sector, at 35 per cent, but the fastest-growing areas were construction and transport; services; and telecoms, high-tech and media.The MCA said that, of the service sector, only retail, administrative and information services appeared to have grown faster than consulting in 2013, while professional services growth in general was slightly lower.In the public sector, where consulting was hit by big cuts in 2010, a modest recovery is under way, with revenue up 3 per cent last year, after a 5 per cent rise in 2012. In real terms, the public sector spend on consulting was about half what it was before the downturn.Mr Connolly said the target customer for many companies was a 50-something member of a PLC board who understood the idea of digital but needed help to translate it into business opportunities. The surge of interest in digital consulting also creates a skills challenge for consultants, many of whom are business analysts rather than technology specialists."
68;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-05-30T18:50:14Z;Corporate citizens of the world owe fealty to us all;Multinationals need to lay down roots wherever they grow;"The head of a British multinational declared this week that he opposed the idea of companies that exist “somewhere in the ether”. It may be “odd to be British, but it’s even odder to say you’re nobody”, this chief executive said. “Who in the world would applaud you for saying that you are rootless?” The answer was, until recently: most business leaders and investors – the very people who were listening to him address a private session at the Inclusive Capitalism conference in London.Global companies in the past 30 years have done all they can to shrug off the uncomfortable trappings of nationality, tax domicile and regulatory jurisdiction in pursuit of profit and efficiency.Such a quest goes against nature. Sailors used to consider a sighting of The Flying Dutchman – a phantom ship condemned never to make port – a ghastly omen. But companies have made a virtue of their loose moorings and changeable identities.They switch headquarters depending on the tax situation – as advertising group WPP did, from London to Dublin and back again. They wave the national flag to win local subsidies or support for new investment, then hide it when trying to sell their products. Sometimes they dangle the implicit threat to decamp if local regulation or legislation does not suit them, as HSBC did when the UK banking regime became uncomfortable, or use deals to arbitrage the advantages of different bases, as Fiat of Italy has done following its takeover of Chrysler. Meanwhile, brand managers play up specific national characteristics (French style, British quality, German engineering) in advertising; or deftly carry on business behind names that offer few clues as to national identity, such as Accenture, Infosys or Diageo.To trade successfully in as many markets as possible, companies have become chameleons. In the process, they have twisted the original hippie slogan for sustainable living – “think global, act local” – into that ugliest of management terms: “glocal”.This global orthodoxy has undoubtedly yielded benefits for companies, their investors and their customers. But, as the British chief executive’s remarks suggest, public tolerance for such shape-shifting has its limits – and Pfizer’s failed attempt to take over AstraZeneca has marked out the boundaries. The public and politicians saw through Pfizer’s plan to form an even bigger global pharmaceutical group, based in large part on fiscal expediency. One unlovable, nominally American dealmaker wanted to buy a rival that The Economist calculated to be only about 12 per cent “British”, based on factors such as employees’ nationalities and where it sells its wares. The failed Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal also shows that, for a multinational company, trying to re-establish community ties means more than picking a flag. In fact, nationality – which whips up debate about protectionism and national champions – is an unhelpful way to measure the depth of a company’s commitment to where it lives.The clever modern company ‘has to fall in love with every jurisdiction in which it has a disproportionate amount of resources’The chairman of another British company says he prefers to emphasise the national heritage of his group, which gives him the freedom to hunt for contracts and investments anywhere in the world. Binding his company too closely to the UK would, he pointed out, also give the impression to non-Brits that they would never reach the top of the corporate hierarchy. As recent research has shown, the upper echelons of the largest companies are still largely dominated by executives from companies’ “home” countries. Such lack of diversity could hinder original and innovative thinking.Roger Martin of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management sums up what companies have lost as they have gone global, recalling the tawdry way in which Boeing – long based in Seattle – in effect put the decision on where to locate its headquarters out to auction to the highest municipal bidder in the early 2000s. Professor Martin writes in his 2011 book, Fixing the Game, that the aircraft maker finally settled on Chicago, which had held out the biggest incentives.In abandoning the communities they once served, he says, companies make it inevitable that their executives will join instead an international community of shareholder-value-driven managers and short-term investors – a league that prefers life at 35,000ft to operating at ground level.Multinationals cannot easily be unravelled. Many vibrant companies start as “micro-multinationals”, raised as international businesses from birth, on a diet of the web and globalisation. Some big companies have started to recognise the risks. As Prof Martin puts it, the clever modern company “has to fall in love with every jurisdiction in which it has a disproportionate amount of resources”. The likes of Unilever and Nestlé say they are committed to developing mutually beneficial relationships with the places where they source their raw materials, a strategy that represents an advance on old-style corporate social responsibility by linking the core business to long-term goals for society and the planet. Still, the temptation to up anchor and set sail again is hard to resist.Companies such as IBM and Cemex, the Mexican cement and building materials company, now aim to become “globally integrated enterprises”, extensive networks that sprout offshoots in whichever country is best suited to a given activity. But if they use this model merely to relocate operations more frequently, based on considerations of tax, cost and efficiency, they will never build the local links that underpin long-term success.Lawrence Summers, former US Treasury secretary, told the same Inclusive Capitalism conference that “business has always felt a responsibility to its location because it’s had a stake in the success of the place where it is headquartered and the place where its workers live.” The challenge is to replicate that bond in a world where national borders are permeable and businesses can burst out of the walls that once confined them.International companies may never again be able or willing to settle on a single place they call home. But they need to find new ways to put down roots in all the places they touch – or risk losing not only their cultural bearings but the public trust on which they depend.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill"
69;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Young people open to alternative banking;;"A Google or Walmart bank would be attractive to a large slice of young consumers, according to a survey that also shows almost four in 10 people aged between 18-34 would switch to a bank without a physical branch network.The results are included in two reports by Accenture, the consultancy, due to be published on Tuesday, which feed the sense of threat felt by the traditional banking sector from newer rivals, particularly technology companies.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, told a shareholder meeting in February: “You'd be an idiot not to think that the Googles and Apples . . . they all want to eat our lunch. I mean, every single one of them. And they're going to try.”Accenture asked 4,000 US and Canadian banking customers: “If these companies offered banking services, how likely would you be to bank with them?”The top companies, with 50 and 41 per cent of respondents saying they would be likely to bank with them, were Square and PayPal, existing digital payments networks. T-Mobile, the mobile phone company, had 32 per cent. Apple and Google had 29 per cent. Costco and Walmart, the retailers, had 29 and 23 per cent of ""likely"" votes from respondents.Whether any of the companies will take on the banks directly is unknown. So far they are nibbling at Mr Dimon’s lunch rather than taking big bites from it.Google Wallet allows customers to pay for goods with their mobile phone. Walmart has gone further, offering a pre-paid debit card called Bluebird in a partnership with American Express, which offers direct deposits.In 2007, the supermarket chain abandoned a plan to set up a bank after a fierce lobbying effort from the incumbent banks. In part, it was Walmart’s huge store infrastructure that terrified the banks but the surveys suggest that a physical presence may be unnecessary. Some 39 per cent of 18-34 year olds said they would switch to a bank with no branch network.US bank branches have been in decline since 2009 because of consolidation and the increased acceptance of online and mobile banking. But there is evidence that consumers still prefer using a bank branch for significant transactions.Wells Fargo, the biggest US bank by market value, told an investor day last week that 85 per cent of products were sold in branches. Wells, based in Silicon Valley’s backyard, in San Francisco, is modifying its branches to cope with new technology but not abandoning them – opting for a greater number of smaller, largely-automated locations.Banks have been warned since at least 1999 that they were about to be usurped by online-only rivals only to see the threat fade.“During the dotcom bubble it was going to be the end of branches and traditional banks and it didn’t turn out that way,” said Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA. “There’s no question that digital banking is one of the fastest growth prospects but the incumbents are getting their fair share.”"
70;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-04-23T16:07:15Z;Social Intrapreneurism and All That Jazz;An insightful look at corporate staff who try to turn a profit from addressing society’s problems;Social Intrapreneurism and All That Jazz: How business innovators are helping to build a more sustainable world, by David Grayson, Melody McLaren and Heiko Spitzeck, Greenleaf Publishing, £25/$40Can business save the world? The question might distract business leaders from more immediate concerns, such as making a profit. Starting a conversation about sustainability, for instance, could even mark you down as an obstacle to success in some people’s eyes.This is the dilemma facing so-called “social intrapreneurs”, desc­rib­ed in this insightful new book as the people in a corporation who put themselves forward to come up with innovations that address social or environmental challenges while generating revenue.The authors have done well to uncover dozens of social intrapreneurs at big businesses around the world, and to get them to tell their stories. The businesses involved include Vodafone, GSK, Accenture, Danone and DHL, among many others, and the individuals have been responsible for significant business activities, which are described at some length in the book. Yet the tension running through this book is that these activities quite often must be carried out – initially, at least – almost by stealth.One (anonymous) witness says: “There were times when I felt like I was fighting a guerrilla war inside the org­an­is­ation.” An­oth­er ob­serves: “People presum­ed this was philanthropy – I said, no, this is about doing good business. Key lesson? Almost disguise soc­ial aspects and . . . emphasise business – then people are happier to talk.” These particular witnesses are hap­py to talk to the authors, but anonymously.Successful social intrapreneurs require champions, protectors or, as the authors label them, “god parents”. These can act as power-brokers, help win access to resour­ces, and if necessary help the social intrapreneur work almost “under the radar”.A leitmotif for the book, tested almost to destruction, is jazz. The authors point out that management literature is full of sporting metaphors that focus on competition, winning and individual leaders, but they argue that “jazz metaphors emphasise the val­ue of co-operation and provide a more nuanced view of leadership.”It turns out that techniques required by social intrapreneurs to advance do have some parallels in jazz that are not so far-fetched. Like a jazz musician, the intrapreneur must go in for “woodshedding” (solitary practice to improve technical skills), “soloing” (putting your ideas forward), “being a sideman” (contri­buting to a group in which you are a supporting team member), and “paying your dues” (contributing to your im­mediate team/community, and earning trust). In other words, social in­tra­pren­eurs must find and construct ensembles to prosper.The authors are all business school academics. Grayson is professor of corporate res­ponsibility at Cranfield school of management, McLaren is an associate at Cranfield while Spitzeck is professor at the Fundação Dom Cabral in Brazil.They describe four types of social intrapreneur. There are those who have left their company because of a lack of support for their idea. There are the exasperated, who stay on but are just con­centrating on the day job. The emergent are starting out with their idea and are still un­clear how the corporate environment will respond. As for the empowered, the company is actively encouraging their idea.The authors are guardedly optimistic. Their successful witnesses have mastered balancing the roles of risk-taking entrepreneurs and rule-following employees within a large organisation. They are “tempered radicals”.“Don’t change companies, change the company you’re in,” advises one social intrapreneur. But this radicalism, too, is tempered by the book, which reminds any aspiring social entrepreneurs of a question they should ask themselves: “Am I prepared to lose my job if this doesn’t work out?”The writer is visiting professor in management at Cass Business School
71;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-04-03T11:14:18Z;Booz & Strategy & the chequered history of consultancy rebranding;;Cesare Mainardi, chief executive of Booz & Company, has a ready explanation for the consultancy’s rebranding as “Strategy&”, now Booz’s takeover by PwC is complete:It invites a discussion about what we’re about and what we’re thinking and how we can help our clients transform.True enough. Unfortunately, the initial discussion of the new “amper-brand” – pronounced “strategy and” – is likely to start with “What were they thinking?”. People still remember PwC’s ill-fated attempt to rename its consulting arm as “Monday” in 2002, a misstep that had plenty of critics humming the Boomtown Rats’ hit “I don’t like Mondays”. (Luckily for the professional services firm, roughly by Tuesday, IBM had bought the consulting business and PwC never had to live with the consequences.)In PwC and Booz’s defence, they had no choice but to rebrand the consulting firm. A condition of Booz’s spin-off from Booz Allen Hamilton in 2008 was that it could no longer use founder Edwin Booz’s name if the consultancy lost its independence. Fiona Czerniawska, managing director of Source, an independent research company specialising in management consulting, thinks rebranding Booz as Strategy& “is a smart move as the phrase ‘strategy and execution’ is on every consultant’s lips these days”. Strategy& also echoes the title of Booz’s well thought of publication Strategy + Business (which lives on).Odd-seeming brands that are at first derided do survive. Diageo was given a kicking, but nobody objects to it now. In consulting, Accenture has outlived its original parent Andersen. Smaller PwC consulting acquisitions such as PRTM, bought in 2011, continue under their own brand. Still, my bet is that Strategy& will prove to be a temporary umbrella to be furled and put away within a couple of years, even if the old Booz business continues to be treated as a member company within the PwC confederation. What is certain is that if PwC’s expansion in consulting is to succeed, Booz’s new owner cannot afford to treat the consultancy as a dangling ampersand to its broader strategy.
72;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-03-27T21:00:09Z;Accenture tumbles on consulting slump;Financial sector lower after Fed rejects bank capital plans;Accenture fell at its sharpest pace in nine months after executives cautioned that the technology and outsourcing consultancy was having difficulty passing higher costs on to clients.It also expected sales in its consulting business to show little, if any, growth this year.In a call with analysts, executives said they still saw the “consulting business being flattish to low-single-digit positive”, even as the company’s outsourcing business picked up speed and the company reported record new bookings of $10.1bn.For the fiscal second quarter, ending on February 28, profits fell 39 per cent to $722m, or $1.03 per diluted share. The results were a penny below Wall Street forecasts.Sales in the quarter rose 1 per cent to $7.6bn. When excluding certain reimbursements, revenues were $80m below analyst consensus.“Accenture results and outlook indicate healthy IT services demand, evidenced by solid bookings, but ramp rates are slow – fiscal second quarter is a seasonally weak quarter – and the release highlighted lower contract profitability,” JPMorgan analyst Tientsin Huang said.Shares in Accenture closed down 5 per cent to $78.80.GameStop shares were under pressure following weaker than expected earnings guidance and the company’s plans to close more of its video game stores.The company said full-year earnings would be in a range of $3.40 to $3.70 per share, below Wall Street expectations for $3.76.Closures, meanwhile, will affect more than 100 of GameStop’s 6,400 video game locations.The shares were down 4 per cent to $37.33.Baxter International, the US manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and medical products, said on Thursday that it would split its business in two, sending its shares higher.The company, which expects the split to be complete by mid-2015, pointed to “diverging business dynamics and the rapidly changing macro-environment” for its decision.“The spin-off will create two, well-capitalised independent companies with strong balance sheets, investment grade profiles, and disciplined approaches to capital allocation,” the company said in a statement.The biopharmaceuticals business had $6bn in sales last year while the medical products business had $9bn.Shares in Baxter rose 3.9 per cent to $72.80, leading the benchmark S&P 500.Signet Jewelers, the owner of the Kay and Jared jewellery chains, climbed after executives said they were “confident” they would meet 2015 goals and forecast earnings ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.The largest speciality jewellery retailer in the US and UK said same-store sales would rise between 3 and 4 per cent in the first quarter, following a 4.4 per cent rise in the fourth quarter.Earnings in the first quarter are forecast between $1.24 and $1.28 a share.“Despite concerns over a frigid Valentine’s day selling season to start [the first quarter], Signet offered an upbeat outlook for first quarter – demonstrating the resiliency of the business,” Sterne Agee analyst Ike Boruchow said.“With gross margin pressure likely alleviating amid solid top-line trends, we see improving fundamentals on the horizon.”Signet shares advanced as much as 9 per cent to $107.38, a new all-time high. They closed at $105.03, up nearly 7 per cent.The financial sector was largely weaker on Thursday, following the Federal Reserve’s stress tests that rejected the capital plans of five banks.Citigroup, the third-largest US bank by assets and one of the five banks to be rebuked by the Fed, dropped 5.4 per cent to $47.45.Overall, US equity markets declined despite an improvement in initial jobless claims and better than anticipated consumer spending in the fourth quarter.The S&P 500 dipped 0.2 per cent to 1,849.04 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged down slightly to 16,264.23. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.5 per cent to 4,151.23.

Seven in 10 respondents in an Accenture worldwide survey of 4,000 executives (male and female) think the number of women on boards, and women chief executives, will increase by 2020.The survey, conducted to mark International Women’s Day, finds technology is helping women to advance.Shaheen Sayed, managing director, human capital and diversity at Accenture in the UK and Ireland, says: “The digital age and advances in technology are creating new definitions of leadership, underpinned by collaboration, agility, empathy and innovation. These traits are not exclusively feminine, but we know that they come very naturally to many women.”Nearly half (44 per cent) of respondents say their companies are preparing more women for senior management roles than last year.Employers plan staffing boostThere was a sharp increase in employers’ confidence in the first few weeks of 2014, according to the latest JobsOutlook report from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. Sixty-nine per cent of employers said they would make more permanent job offers in the next three months.Employers are also predicting shortages of drivers and distribution workers for both permanent and temporary roles in coming months.Job seekers warm to mobileDespite the growing prevalence of mobile devices – almost all UK job seekers own a smartphone – employers are still lagging behind Generation Y when it comes to providing career information via mobile, according to research by Sweden’s Potentialpark.Forty-six per cent of UK job seekers would like to be updated on the status of their application through mobile, but none of the employers surveyed offer that. And while not many companies offered the possibility to apply via mobile, 18 per cent of job seekers had tried.Potentialpark found that Accenture, KPMG and IBM had the most competitive online talent communication practices among companies active in the UK, based on their career website, application process, social media and mobile communication (see table).Ranking consists of companies with activities in the UK

74;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-02-18T23:51:16Z;Mondelez set for new cost-control strategy;;Mondelez has hired Accenture to help it implement a severe cost-control budgeting system championed by 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity fund that took over Heinz last year.The move comes as Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, works to streamline operations and deliver $3bn in gross productivity savings over three years, and is a sign that the lean, cost-conscious 3G model may be catching on in an industry battling sluggish growth.“We’ve watched the work that 3G has done with AB InBev and Heinz – Accenture was the partner with them and we believe they can be of great help to us,” Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive of Mondelez, told the Financial Times on the sidelines of the Consumer Analysts Group of New York conference in Florida.She told the conference the approach requires a “maniacal focus from the top”, and that Accenture would help Mondelez “rapidly take out costs” as the company strives to meet its forecast of increasing operating margins from 12 per cent last year to 14-16 per cent by 2016.3G has become known for its use of “zero-based budgeting”, wherein managers are tasked with building budgets from scratch rather than basing them on the previous year’s plan.The system requires businesses to justify every expense anew each year, and played a large role in helping 3G deliver better-than-announced savings when it merged Interbrew and AmBev in 2004 to create InBev, and that company with Anheuser-Busch in 2008 to create AB InBev.At Heinz, which 3G and Berkshire Hathaway acquired for $27bn last year, the strategy has so far resulted in about 2,000 job cuts and three plant closings in North America.3G’s cost-cutting has “surprised” and “scared” many in the industry because Heinz was seen as a very efficient company after going through a series of cuts in 2006 under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz, Nicholas Fereday, analyst at Rabobank, wrote in a recent note to investors.Mr Peltz has also long advocated lowering costs at Mondelez, which has struggled since it was split from Kraft Foods Group in 2012, and has criticised the company’s profit margins. Last month, Mr Peltz said he would drop his campaign for PepsiCo to buy Mondelez after Mondelez added him to its board.Amid criticism from Mr Peltz, Mondelez closed, sold or streamlined 30 plants, and cut more than 3,000 jobs in 2013.But Mark Clouse, president of the company’s North American business, said it was “important to understand that [zero-based budgeting] …is not about slash and burn – it’s about making a series of choices about what’s going to matter most”.Mr Clouse did not comment on the prospect of further jobs cuts or plant closures, but said the company was “looking at the best opportunities to optimise” operations “in conjunction with our union partners”.Mondelez is not alone.Kellogg, the breakfast cereal maker, and ConAgra, which makes Hunt’s ketchup and other packaged foods, have also announced plant closures, job cuts and other cost-cutting measures in recent months as the food industry struggles with a slowdown in global consumer spending.On Tuesday, Coca-Cola also announced another $1bn in cost-cuts after reporting an 8.4 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits.
75;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-01-24T16:34:07Z;From the tech backlash to Rouhani being the real deal: Lionel Barber’s 5 Davos takeaways;;I arrived in VIP-full Davos with one prediction in mind: 2014 will be the year the world returns to normality or at least the semblance of normality with the tapered exit from quantitative easing.After three days at high altitude, the prediction is intact and I have five other takeaways.1) Even as a broad recovery based on housing and manufacturing takes hold in the US, there are worries about Europe. The existential threat to the euro is over but Merkel’s Germany has shuffled left, demographics are poor, anti-immigration movements are on the rise, including in the UK, and growth appears terminally tepid. Worries about a China slowdown though are overblown.2) The tech backlash is coming: it was astonishing how much fretting there was about technology as the jobs destroyer not the great liberator. Was it all down to a powerful Economist front cover last week or other troubling numbers about tech killing jobs in the professional services (the banks!) and manufacturing in emerging markets?3) The banks are turning into utilities (with still high salaries) but are making a big effort to clean up their image and rebut Lord Turner’s accusation they are engaged in “socially useless” activities. I attended an impressive Barclays breakfast this morning where Chief Executive Antony Jenkins outlined his charter for lending to the great unbanked. The initiative is three years old but Barclays is now pushing other powerful NGOs like the Clinton Global Initiative and private companies (Accenture, Allianz and Visa) to come aboard and help in places like Africa. It just needs to work and be more than good deeds.4) The Democrats and Republicans are like two heavyweight boxers who have punched themselves senseless and are now propping themselves up in the ring (this is called “coming together” ?) The loose Tea Party talk about debt default is off the agenda – Wall Street and the men and women with the money said no more in 2013 – and therefore we won’t have a long and scary stand off this year. But the White House thinks the Republicans may do something dangerous and eye-catching just for Tea Party show before striking a budget deal.5) President Hassan Rouhani of Iran is for real and he wants a deal to end his country’s isolation. I saw him close-up this week for the second time in two months. And while the session was off the record, he was refreshingly open in private about environmental damage and youth unemployment. He won’t give up Iran’s nuclear energy option (and he does not quite convince why oil- and gas-rich Iran needs nuclear for its energy mix). But the economic stresses are real and his country needs foreign investment. And while Iran can grow five per cent plus this year, Iran’s huge potential will only be realised if sanctions are lifted.Final thought: my bet is President Barack Obama is strong enough to block a new round of congressional sanctions, but a comprehensive deal with Iran will be difficult to do inside 12 months.
76;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-01-22T12:15:10Z;Davos view: Don’t get too confident about Eurozone prospects;;By Gillian TettJust in case anyone was starting to feel too relaxed or cheerful about the outlook for the Eurozone, Axel Weber, UBS chairman, delivered a sober slap-down today.In a downbeat session with business leaders and academics about the future of Europe, Weber pointed out that the current pace of growth was not nearly fast enough to really dent unemployment or set the region on a sustainable growth path. And in practical terms, that meant Europe faced at least two risks this year.One was the danger that European elections could show a growing mood of political protest – and volatility.Secondly, the ECB’s stress tests could spark new market alarm about the banks – which would impact sovereigns too.“I expect some of the banks to not pass the stress tests and I am concerned that as this becomes clear this will spark a market reaction,” he warned.Meanwhile Pierre Nanterme, Accenture CEO and chairman, echoed the unease about politics – and rising social strains. “What I am concerned about is the rise of the extreme in Europe,” he declared, pointing to the “lack of inclusion” in what little growth is currently underway.
77;ACN;Accenture Plc;2014-01-19T17:37:23Z;UBS to outsource fixed income trading platform;;UBS has struck two deals to outsource most of its fixed income trading platform in a radical step highlighting the scale of cost pressures in the investment banking sector.The Swiss bank will replace its patchwork of multiple trading platforms with standardised solutions from technology groups Murex and Ion Trading, people close to the situation said.Top-tier banks have long outsourced various smaller pieces of trading technology, but UBS’s move is seen as the most drastic so far by a larger lender.Analysts said it would enable UBS to reduce staff levels throughout its rates and credit trading business, and potentially allow the bank to strip out hundreds of millions in costs over a number of years.UBS decided more than a year ago to pare back substantially its fixed income business. Apart from a continuing strong presence in foreign exchange and precious metals, the bank is concentrating on a much smaller, client-driven rates and credit business.It has chosen Murex, the French trading software company, to take over large parts of its fixed income platform, including areas such as the booking of trades, their valuation and risk management, people close the situation said.In addition, the bank has chosen Ion Trading to provide gateways to electronic exchanges and pricing tools.Bankers said UBS’s move underlined how investment banks were starting to tackle a bloated technology infrastructure that was built up during the boom years.The market leaders spend several billion dollars a year on technology but are desperately looking for ways to cut costs as moves towards electronic trading and severely tighter regulations increase IT expenses.October 2013: Third-quarter numbers were ugly for UBS and there was more bad news from the regulatorsLarger banks retain technologies they have developed in house, and initiatives to share costs between rivals have failed.Some second-tier investment banks have gone further recently, with France’s Société Générale outsourcing its post-trade processing to a partnership between Accenture and Broadridge.Fixed income trading has been under particular pressure recently with tighter regulatory capital rules, a move towards lower-margin central clearing of derivatives and a severe slump in revenues in the second half of last year.
78;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-12-23T18:34:11Z;Booz & Co approves plan to merge with PwC;Deal strengthens accounting group’s consulting capacity;Partners at Booz & Co, the consulting group, have approved a plan to merge with PwC.The deal, proposed in October, strengthens PwC’s strategy consulting capacity.Last week partners at rival Roland Berger decided to continue as an independent consultancy, after the German group’s executive committee concluded there was insufficient internal support for a potential deal with EY, another of the big four professional services companies.Medium-sized consulting firms such as Booz have struggled to compete with bigger rivals such as McKinsey and Bain & Co since the financial crisis, with most clients demanding advisers with global scale or niche specialisms.PwC, one of the big four professional services firms with $32bn in annual revenues last year, had been talking about a potential link-up with Booz for nine months, but other companies, including Accenture, had also expressed an interest.The value of the deal remains unclear, though it is understood to be worth at least the $1bn that Booz makes in annual revenues, according to people familiar with the agreement.Booz, which was founded by Edwin Booz in 1914, is set to give up its name and trade under the PwC umbrella.Consulting deals are notoriously difficult to make work, given the potential for clashes of culture.Merger talks between Booz and AT Kearney, another management consultant, foundered in 2010.However, this year, Deloitte succeeded in buying bought Monitor, the strategy house co-founded by Michael Porter, the Harvard management expert, out of bankruptcy.

80;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Enterprise apps: Employees sign up with the company store;An in-house app market means greater control in bring-your-own-device world;By 2017, one in four organisations will have deployed an enterprise app store, where employees can download company-sanctioned apps to their mobile devices.That forecast comes from IT market research company Gartner, where analysts see a range of benefits for companies.“Enterprise app stores promise greater control over the apps used by employees, greater control over software expenditure and greater negotiating leverage with apps vendors,” says Gartner analyst Ian Finley.Some companies have already made a start. At Essilor International, the big French manufacturer of ophthalmic lenses, the domestic sales force has been armed with iPads to take to customer meetings. The apps they need to make a sale are downloaded from the company’s Essi Store, an enterprise app store built with technology from Airwatch, a mobile device management specialist.The tools available to them there include an electronic catalogue of all the company’s lenses, animated presentations that help them market specific kinds of lenses to customers and an internally developed customer relationship management application, Teranga. The latter gives them instant access to details of leads, existing customer accounts and sample contracts, explains Mathieu Ngo, IT project manager at Essilor International.At the back end, he explains, IT administrative staff can “follow the number of apps downloaded, notify users about the availability of new apps and updates and push the apps to an employee’s iPad”. The team is working on a project to push apps to Windows 8 tablets and plans new sales force apps for 2014, he says.Users tend to be comfortable with this kind of set-up, because it mirrors their experience of downloading apps from consumer-focused app stores such as Google Play and Apple’s App Store, says Alex Achucarro, head of mobile at Avanade UK, a business technology services company formed as a joint venture between Microsoft and Accenture.When it comes to IT professionals, he adds, “you’re pushing at an open door.” This is “because the widespread introduction of BYOD [bring your own device] policies in organisations has got managers worried about the potential risks and administrative burden associated with making sure that employees are using approved applications, securely, on a vast array of different devices”.If enterprise app stores are to compete for the hearts and minds of mobile-equipped employees, they need to offer employees the same kind of choice, flexibility and user experience as their consumer counterparts, says Mr Finley at Gartner.An enterprise app store can help IT departments achieve greater control only if it is widely adopted by employees, he points out. A limited choice of applications will doom the effort to failure.“Choice is a critical value proposition for an enterprise app store. Without it, there is no reason for a user to participate,” he says. “They should be able to research a catalogue of options and make selections based on their own preferences.”A good enterprise app store, for example, will enable users to base their choices on feedback from their colleagues and to provide their own feedback.At broadcasting company BSkyB a concerted effort is under way to increase the choice of apps available to employees on the in-house enterprise app store, My Apps.This store, based on technology from mobile device management specialist MobileIron, was implemented 12 months ago for the use of two groups of BSkyB employees.Sales advisers can download an app that enables them to show the range of programme choices available to potential customers. Engineers, meanwhile, can use apps to track and manage jobs and to place orders.But, says Amardeep Rai, a solutions architect at BSkyB, “we have seen a cross-department interest in in-house apps that wasn’t expected”.Development teams at BSkyB are working on a much wider range of apps for employees, including holiday booking, time sheet submission and expenses apps, as well as an app for tracking the balance of their canteen cash card. “And we are still in the early stages of revolutionising the way users interact with the company through mobile applications,” says Mr Rai.It is a pattern that Avanade’s Mr Achucarro has observed at many organisations. “They start off with one or two apps, but other parts of the business start to demand their own and the whole effort starts to balloon,” he says.That can present problems for in-house software development teams, he says, because employees have high expectations of an app, whether it is downloaded from a consumer or enterprise app store.In other words, software developers must focus on delivering a compelling experience and a certain amount of design flair.“The danger is that, under pressure, they find themselves rushing to cobble together a mobile app that interfaces with older back-end technology – an expenses system, for example,” says Mr Achucarro. “But if the resulting app is clunky and unattractive and, as a result, no one uses it, then they’re back to square one.”
81;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-11-19T15:55:49Z;Green developments: Work gathers speed on sustainable alternatives;Manufacturers form tie-ups to tackle regional differences;The car as we know it is not so much hurtling towards a crossroads as cautiously approaching a big, confusing roundabout.Carmakers, under pressure from western governments to reduce emissions, need to find alternatives to conventional petrol and diesel engines.Green technology options abound but progress has been slow and the combustion engine that has for decades been the mainstream option shows no signs of being unthroned.Electric vehicles – once seen as the future of the car industry – are expected to account for less than 1 per cent of global car sales in 2020, according to LMC Automotive, an industry analyst. When plug-ins and other electrified hybrids are included, that figure rises to just 4 per cent.Yet alternative technologies as a group are expected to play an increasing role in the future of cars, which means the leading manufacturers cannot ignore them.Luxury German carmaker BMW in September joined the ranks of the converted with the unveiling of the i3, its first all-electric model, while Volkswagen, Europe’s largest manufacturer by sales, announced it would develop electric cars for the first time this summer.“I think they have taken a view that they have to be looking at all the major technologies, because they can’t afford to be left behind,” says Al Bedwell at LMC Automotive,The approach taken by Vauxhall is typical of many. The UK manufacturer, which with Opel is part of the European arm of General Motors of the US, has a three-pronged strategy.First, it is continuing to refine the combustion engine in terms of emissions and so-called “lightweighting”. Second, it is investing in electric vehicle development, seeking a successor to its Vauxhall/Opel Ampera plug-in hybrid – the European cousin of the Chevrolet Volt. Third, it is working on other hybrid options.This landscape is complicated by regional differences. In Japan, hybrids accounted for 20 per cent of sales last year, partly because of government incentives. There is significant demand in the US, but less in Europe, where petrol and diesel power 96 per cent of cars.“Manufacturers are taking a global view, because the requirements differ considerably by region. What would work in the US or Japan is not going to work in Europe,” says Mr Bedwell.As a result, carmakers are clubbing together. GM and Honda in July announced a seven-year alliance to build hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles following similar tie-ups announced in January between Toyota and BMW and Daimler, Ford and Nissan.By “spreading costs and creating economies of scale, we will ultimately bring hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles to market faster and, crucially, at a lower price”, says Andy Palmer, executive vice-president at NissanThere is much excitement in the industry about this technology.Some say that by the time the problems facing electric vehicles – range, cost and recharging networks – have been overcome, carmakers will have moved on to hydrogen-powered vehicles.Others say the lack of vehicles, recharging points and fuel mean hydrogen has little chance of going mainstream soon.“From a theoretical point of view, I can’t see how it is going to happen, unless there is a breakthrough in one of those areas,” says Ian O’Gara, head of global biofuels at Accenture, the management consultancy.But Acal Energy, a UK chemicals company, says it has made a breakthrough in developing a liquid catalyst that slashes hydrogen vehicle costs by reducing the use of expensive platinum, while delivering performance comparable with diesel engines.It has signed development agreements with six leading carmakers in the US, Germany and Japan and plans to license the technology to the manufacturers.“It helps that they’re taking a modular approach,” says Mr Bedwell.
82;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-11-18T12:10:56Z;Hotshot takes helm at Severn Trent;;Liv Garfield might have been overlooked as a potential successor to BT boss Ian Livingstone when he joined the government as minister for trade and investment, but it was only a matter of time before she landed a big job.The 38-year-old mother of two is set to become the youngest female chief executive of a FTSE 100 company after being confirmed as Severn Trent’s chief executive.Named as one of the world’s hottest business rising stars by Fortune Magazine, Ms Garfield already ranks among some of the business world’s biggest movers and shakers, including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.Described by colleagues as “voluble”, the enthusiastic Yorkshire-born executive displayed a work ethic from a young age when she helped her parents run their project management and engineering business, Brentwood Design Partnership, during school holidays.After reading German and French at Cambridge, she spent six years with management consultancy Accenture in its high-tech market division.She joined BT as general manager in 2000, running a desk-based sales team, and working as the telecoms group’s director of strategy and regulatory affairs before being appointed boss of its Openreach division in 2011 at the age of just 35.In her submission to Fortune, Ms Garfield said her proudest career achievement to date had been compiling the business case for BT’s £2.5bn investment to deliver fibre broadband to two-thirds of the UK.She landed her first FTSE 100 directorship in February, joining the board of Tesco.
83;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
84;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-11-11T21:00:56Z;Talent management: Pay is not the only incentive for employees;Employers do well to pay attention to the working environment;"The entrance of a younger generation of “digital natives” who take the use of technology in every facet of their lives for granted has made management consultancies think harder about how to attract and retain talented youngsters without alienating middle-management staff.Every stage – from understanding the mindset of young people and training them, through to keeping them – is being monitored.“There is a whole new generation of people who interact in a different way,” says Jon Andrews, head of the human resource services practice at PwC.He describes millennials, who were born between 1980 and 2000, as “togglists” because they routinely toggle between applications and assignments. He called older people “compartmentalists”.“Younger people aren’t necessarily more or less tech-minded but the difference is inherent in the way that they use technology,“ he says.In a mundane example, he says older people might take a personal device on holiday, hide away from the family to check email, then use another device to read a book. Digital natives, on the other hand, will take one device and toggle between email, music and other applications.“In the workplace, the concept of compartmentalised meetings is much less relevant. Digital natives have a higher degree of fluidity and will chat online or face to face whenever necessary,” says Mr Andrews.He points to a PwC survey, Millennials at Work, which found that personal learning and development and work/life balance were more important than financial reward. Cash bonuses came in third.“They are constantly looking for feedback. We have training programmes where there isn’t just a once-a-year review, but a number of touch points; we’ve identified people whose strength is people management because you can’t expect everyone to be good at it,” says Mr Andrews.Professional services firms are in the top rank when it comes to recruiting talent, but they cannot always assume that offering high pay would “lock in” their recruits, says Eugene Burke, chief science and analytics officer at CEB, a business advisory and research company.“Recruiters are heavily focused on the ‘best’ and brightest graduates and do not necessarily understand what ‘best’ is for their organisation,” he says. “This is creating un­precedented levels of competition in the war for graduate talent.”Only one in 15 graduates is classed as top talent, according to CEB research, so employers should also look at building talent through learning and development programmes, says Mr Burke.In CEB’s employability model, graduates are scored on their execution skills – including enterprise and performance – and their levels of engagement, including leadership and ability to adapt.The odds of recruiting a graduate with a good score on engagement are lower than getting one who is good at execution, says Mr Burke. “To find future leaders, employers should think more about recruiting at the later stages of someone’s career.”This year, Accenture has made what it calls “experienced hires” – people in their mid- to late-20s with three to five years’ work experience.Gilly Bryant, who heads the firm’s Analyst Consulting Group, says: “Where we’ve changed is that we’ve taken on 50 experienced hires who don’t come through the classic channels of entry, but have previous work experience that’s very relevant.”“Clients haven’t stated a preference for younger people as such, but rather for experience and skills.”When it comes to training, firms are aiming for a dynamic, multi-platform framework that uses smart phones, blogging and technology hubs. Equal emphasis is put on raising existing staff’s skills and training the newest recruits.Accenture, like other big firms, says it is not aware of any staff who feel threatened by younger recruits, because they know that continuous self-improvement through experience and through company training schemes is vital for the job.“There are lots of people like me with 12-plus years’ experience,” says Ms Bryant. Mid-level staff have the opportunity to develop their own personal leadership style by managing the latest recruits, and are motivated to take part in training as a way to prepare the way for their own promotion, she says.EY also emphasises middle-management training. Bill Farrell, global advisory people leader, says: “We do a lot of work around the inclusiveness agenda so that older people understand the new expressions of younger people.”Loyalty and retention are obviously valued by firms, but priority is also given to retaining connections through channels such as alumni networks, to deal with the inevitable turn­over of staff.“We recognise that not everyone will stay here for their whole career,” says Mr Farrell. “But however long you do stay, we expect the experience to stay with you for a lifetime. We develop relationships over the long term.”EY has found success with its “building a better working world” strategy. “It’s resonating really well with young people, who see themselves as contributing across society,” he says.He points to the firm’s number two ranking – after Google – as the world’s most attractive employer, in a survey by Universum, which contacted 200,000 students around the world.“We’ve always tried to understand the buying power of this new generation,” says Mr Farrell."
85;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;RSA’s aggressive Irish expansion runs out of luck;;For some time, it seemed RSA had better luck than the Irish. Even as Ireland’s economy was struggling to recover from a banking crisis and a deep recession, the London-based insurer appeared to be winning business in the republic.Five years after Philip Smith took over as chief executive of RSA’s Ireland arm in 2007, the insurer overtook arch-rival Aviva as the country’s biggest non-life insurer, with almost 1m policyholders.Institutional investors in London did not pay much attention: the country remained a relatively small concern for the FTSE 100 group, whose operations span from Quebec to Denmark.But Ireland’s local insurance industry was certainly taking note, especially after RSA bought a brand whose catchy jingle – “123.ie, just log on and save mon-ee” – became well known throughout the country.Unfortunately for investors, RSA is now better known in Ireland for less agreeable financial outcomes. On Friday, it disclosed accounting irregularities that prompted it to issue a second profit warning within a week.“With the benefit of hindsight,” said Andy Hughes, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, the aggressive expansion in Ireland “should have raised questions”.As it was, detailed questions were not asked until last Tuesday, when RSA warned that its motor insurance business in Ireland would need to strengthen its reserves because accident victims were making more frequent and higher-cost injury claims.This raised some analysts’ eyebrows: Aviva had been receiving more frequent bodily injury claims in Ireland for several months, but had already increased its premiums to deal with them. It did not regard bodily injury claims in Ireland “as an issue”.Simon Lee, RSA chief executive, struggled to explain why his company had suddenly encountered the reserving difficulties. But even though analysts cut profit forecasts, the problem seemed contained.On Monday, Mr Lee explained that it was only later last week – after the insurer had looked at the apparent shortfall in reserves more closely – that the board realised the problems were more serious, prompting the second profit warning on Friday night.Richard Houghton, finance director, said RSA believed the accounting problems in Ireland – where the insurer covers pets, archaeologists and engineering projects as well as homes and vehicles – dated back at least two years.A corporate turnround should resemble a smartly executed three-point turn, writes Jonathan Guthrie. Instead, two years into the job, RSA Insurance chief executive Simon Lee looks more like a motorist who has suffered a multiple rear-end shunt. The general insurer issued its second profits warning within a week on Friday after the market shut. The shares had fallen 10.5 per cent by the close on Mondaycontinue readingThe group had identified two potential problems, Mr Houghton said. The first concerned the way the Irish business booked large losses, suggesting it may have been under-provisioning for big claims – flattering short-term performance at the expense of reserves that it should have set aside.It emerged last week that the insurer had put aside £140m worth of reserves for the business – the same as the value of premiums it wrote last year. Analysts would typically expect reserves to be about 1.5 times the premiums written.The second problem was the insurance equivalent of revenue recognition – when the company recorded “earned” income, as opposed to premiums merely “written”.Both are serious issues for insurers, whose accounting even some industry specialists find opaque.“Investors take prudent claims and reserves practices on trust,” says Gordon Aitken, analyst at RBC. “This is a very serious issue for an insurance company.”RSA’s Ireland arm has suspended Mr Smith, as well as Rory O’Connor, finance director, and Peter Burke, claims director, “pending the outcome of an investigation”. But it said “no findings have been made against any individuals at this time”.After holding an emergency board meeting over the weekend, RSA appointed PwC to conduct a review of its controls. It will not publish the report but has pledged to make public the “key conclusions”.In the meantime, the profit warnings have raised wider concerns about how the company can revive investor confidence.Mr Lee insists the difficulties are confined to Ireland, but added: “I’m constrained exactly as to why we believe that this incident is isolated.”
86;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-11-07T00:05:07Z;Duncan Smith stands by under-fire welfare mandarin;;Iain Duncan Smith has endorsed his top official at the department for work and pensions despite a second critical report on Wednesday into management of the government’s flagship welfare programme.Relations between the minister and Robert Devereux, his permanent secretary, were understood to have become strained over a failure to hit the timetable to deliver universal credit.Tensions deepened in September after the welfare secretary blamed his civil servants following publication of a National Audit Office report which criticised the scheme’s “weak management, ineffective control and poor governance”.Whitehall had been starting to plan for the permanent secretary’s possible departure from the role. However, it is understood that civil service leaders concluded there were no formal grounds for moving him, and Mr Devereux is said to have thrown himself into delivering the programme.Mr Duncan Smith is thought to have been watching to see whether Wednesday’s report from the public accounts committee levelled personal criticism at Mr Devereux, who was given a rough ride when he gave evidence to the committee six weeks ago.The report, while heavily critical of the “alarmingly weak” management of the programme, only twice mentioned the permanent secretary. It said that he “and his team” should have been more alert to early warning signs that things were going wrong and, in the context of broader concerns about governance, noted that he had discussed progress with the head of UC “only every two or three weeks”.As the NAO report had done, it highlighted a fortress mentality in the department that had led to bad news about the programme being suppressed.An aide to Mr Duncan Smith said: “Iain was clear back in the summer about how he and the permanent secretary took action to fix those problems. He has every confidence with the team now in place, and that team includes Robert Devereux.”The PAC hit out at “a shocking absence of control over suppliers”, which included Accenture, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. The department had failed “to implement the most basic procedures for monitoring and authorising expenditure” and individual payments could not be linked to the delivery of particular pieces of work.Suggesting that the deadline of 2017 for moving all welfare claimants to universal credit might be unrealistic, it said: “We believe strongly that meeting any specific timetable from now on is less important than delivering the programme successfully.“The DWP stopped short of an absolute commitment that the 2017 date would be met, saying: “We will announce our plans for the next phase of UC delivery shortly.”It said the report had not taken into account the programme’s new leadership team and said it had “already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial controls”.It also rejected the PAC’s suggestion that at least £140m of taxpayers’ money might have to be written off because some IT assets that had been delivered could not be used in the programme.It expected the figure to be “substantially less” and the head of universal credit, Howard Shiplee, had “been clear that there is real potential to use much of the existing IT,” it said.
87;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-11-06T11:10:56Z;How valuable is international work experience?;And where are people prepared to go?;As companies grow they spread across the globe, creating international career opportunities – and these are expected to increase dramatically.Recent research by PwC, the professional services firm, predicts the number of workers who will take on global assignments will rise by 50 per cent over the next decade.The findings also suggest that graduates are more than willing to help companies fulfil their growth ambitions by working abroad – but only 11 per cent of these graduates appear happy to go to India and only 2 per cent to China.But how valuable is international work experience, and why are China and India such low-rated destinations?Oliver Watson, managing director for UK, North America and the Middle East at Michael Page, the search firm, says it is worth a great deal. “Companies are operating over so many international boundaries, so the more languages and experience with different cultures you can bring to a company, the more you can help expand its global reach,” he says.Peter Lacy, managing director of strategy for the Asia-Pacific region at Accenture, the management consultancy, says it is a crucial differentiator for current and future leaders. “Our clients increasingly operate seamlessly across borders. Our people need to be able to do the same,” he says. “That mindset comes from being exposed to new business cultures and experiences that come with international placements.”This is backed up by Ben Searls, a senior manager at recruiter Badenoch & Clark. He believes those without work experience abroad will struggle to get the top jobs. “If you have international work experience, you’re likely to be confident and have an outgoing personality, which helps you engage with stakeholders,” he says.His colleague Andrew Caulfield, a managing consultant in the firm’s legal division, agrees. Having experience of different cultures is seen as vital. “All lawyers are regarded as more suitable if they have had exposure to an international platform.”The popularity, or otherwise, of certain countries seems to depend on sector. Mr Watson says for people working in finance, the financial hubs are always going to be most in demand. “London, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo are the places people want to be. Somewhere like Buenos Aires perhaps counts for less than New York when you work in the banking industry,” he says.For structural engineers, on the other hand, the Middle East, and Central and South America are ideal. “Any place with a big infrastructure spend,” he adds.“Those going to China or India need to be more adventurous, but for the right people they could provide excellent opportunities. They are interesting, and some businesses do find it easier to place people in China and India than others.”Mr Lacy, who himself lives with his young family in Shanghai, thinks China is a great place to get experience. He runs Accenture’s strategy business and its sustainability services division and believes China is “one of the most important markets for these issues and will define the global business context for decades”.China is especially attractive to him as it means being at the centre of the challenges faced by multinational companies doing business there, while domestic companies are themselves looking to “go global”. He believes markets such as China, India, and those belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, such as Thailand and Indonesia, are stimulating places to learn.But Mr Searls does not see any desire from job candidates to work in China and India at all. He recruits for the finance sector and many young professionals are often more concerned about the safety of their families than their career. “Australia is a top ranking destination for people who are taking their families. The US is always a popular choice, too,” he says.Mr Caulfield adds that countries such as China and India often have certain market restrictions. India is closed to external lawyers, for example. The cultural divide can often be a turn-off for westerners, too. “Australia and the US are popular because you get experience abroad, but there are elements of cultural continuity.”Saudi Arabia is another unpopular choice, particularly with female job seekers, due to the severe lifestyle restrictions. “Saudi has a huge number of jobs, but female employees can’t do anything, so they’re not going to go there,” says Mr Watson.Mr Lacy, on the other hand, is finding China to be his most interesting assignment. “It is a fascinating life experience for me and my young family – a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn about one of the most historic and exciting cultures in the world,” he says.His work running regional businesses at Accenture has taken him to Costa Rica, Latin America and Brussels, Belgium, but he says China is different. Cultural differences and “the west’s relative blind spot to the real intricacies of its history and culture” mean he has enjoyed a steep but very rewarding learning curve both in business and personally.“This was more pronounced than my spells in continental Europe and Latin America, where the cultural reference points, while different, are more recognisable and the business culture has more in common with the UK,” he says.Though graduates are keen to work abroad, their expectations will almost certainly have to adjust as the best opportunities will be in future growth markets, which include China and India. Mr Lacy adds that there are also development opportunities and chances to take on responsibility in Africa.The PwC report predicts that the need to fill positions around the world is likely to see businesses use staff more flexibly.It also expects the traditional flow of talent from west to east will be reversed as emerging markets become even more important. It sees skilled workers from emerging economies moving into developed countries, often on short-term assignments, to gain valuable experience that can then be used in their home markets.
88;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Professional services firms take digital fight to marketers;;Instead of grey suits and sober ties, think tattoos, oversized glasses and gingham shirts.Deloitte last week bought Seattle-based social media marketing agency Banyan Branch for an undisclosed sum. The world’s biggest professional services firm by revenues also acquired Brisbane web developer Digicon in September.These may seem strange acquisitions for a company that made its name in the 19th century as a solid auditor of railway companies. But they are part of a larger gamble by consultants that their clients’ needs for marketing and technology expertise are coming together in the era of big data, social media and mobile devices.Marketers and advertising agencies have already made digital a core part of their business, but recent acquisitions by Deloitte and its rivals show professional services firms are also diversifying into this fast-growing area.“You’re seeing the role of chief marketing officer and chief information officer converging, and the emergence of a chief digital officer,” says Mike Brinker, US head of Deloitte Digital, the 18-month-old unit that will absorb Banyan.Banyan uses algorithms and anthropologists to sift through Twitter and other social networks, and helps companies create promotional campaigns.“Social media is actually spreading through every aspect of business – not just marketing and communications, but the whole enterprise,” says co-founder David Hanley. He notes the software behind the rewards programme for flights and hotels can be tweaked to nudge regular customers into promoting those brands online.Deloitte Digital is “one of the fastest growing services within Deloitte” in revenue terms, according to Mr Brinker. It employs about 2,500 people and accounted for about 1 per cent of Deloitte’s $32.4bn revenue in 2012, according to estimates from technology analysts Gartner.Deloitte’s competitors are taking similar steps. Booz & Company launched a dedicated digital unit in December, while Accenture acquired London-based design consultancy Fjord in May.Having design capabilities helped Accenture win a contract this year from Nespresso, which makes a line of coffee machines and capsules. The Nestlé-owned brand wanted new services, such as allowing customers to order capsules online and pick them up from local vendors.The ordering system required design work an agency would normally have done, but also a real-time inventory function and supply-chain management that is the traditional preserve of professional services firms like Accenture.“Digital is about customer experience – it’s not just about creative, but about technology and process,” says Anatoly Roytman, managing director of Accenture’s interactive unit in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Mr. Roytman says his firm will continue to use work with agencies for more complex design work, advertising and branding.Digital is about customer experience – it’s not just about creative, but about technology and processEven so, “we seem to have entered a phase in which consultancies are getting into the agency business”, says Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group.This encroachment has not gone unnoticed. “Deloitte has to be quite careful,” says Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising and media group WPP. He describes the firm as a “frenemy” in the area of data and digital, noting that it also audits WPP’s accounts. “It does raise the question from our point of view of who we’re dealing with,” he says.Others have pointed to the risks of a cultural clash in trying to run a one-stop shop. Alwin Magimay, head of digital and analytics at KPMG UK, recently joined the firm after working at Accenture and then Deloitte Digital. “If you mix the DNA of a small creative company and the DNA of a big company, what you find is the creatives get frustrated and leave,” he says.Peter Stein, the global chief executive of Razorfish, an interactive agency that is part of the Publicis advertising group, adds: “Their legacy processes, methodologies and culture are diametrically opposed to this way of working.”
89;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-10-16T14:27:52Z;Which make the best accountants – graduates or school leavers?;We look at the differences between the two types of young recruits;"Accountancy firms compete for the youngsters with most potential, and in recent years this has meant hiring and training more school leavers as well as graduates. But which do they think are best?“We’ve got school leavers who joined us nine or 10 years ago who are now on track for partner and senior management level,” says Richard Irwin, head of student recruitment at PwC, the accountancy and professional services firm. “We are very demanding and expect all our people to progress. It’s not about what they studied years ago.”PwC, like many big accounting firms, recruits school leavers alongside graduates and trains each group so that they eventually become interchangeable in terms of skills and the opportunities available to them.School-leaver programmes, higher apprenticeships and programmes combining a degree with work experience and internships have all been boosted in recent years. All are aimed at encouraging more youngsters to consider an accountancy career.“These different routes into the firm provide a good hedge for us,” says Mr Irwin. “We also found there were areas, such as junior transactions work, that can be done by higher apprentices, who can then go on to the graduate track if they want.”Asked whether school leavers and apprentices are comparable with graduates, he replies: “That question’s already been answered for us. They may even progress faster.”The firm has even lowered the minimum A-level requirement needed to gain a higher apprenticeship, he adds.“Academic performance is very important to us but we lowered the threshold and supplemented it with aptitude testing and interviews,” says Mr Irwin. “We recognise that A-levels can be a barrier to social mobility because there’s a big correlation between social class and how well you do in school. Behavioural skills and intelligence are just as important.”There was also a more “hard-nosed” argument in favour of recruiting school leavers, says Liz Bingham, EY’s managing partner for talent in the UK and Ireland. “School leavers often show more loyalty in the long run and I’m not sure what drives that,” she says.EY, one of the “big four” accounting firms along with PwC, KPMG and Deloitte, takes on about 60 students a year but has plans to expand the programme next year and its success has prompted some clients to ask for more details as they consider starting their own programmes.“These programmes will expand because rising tuition fees mean that more students are looking for alternatives. Also, an ageing population means organisations have to think differently because of the diminishing size of the pool of talent,” she says. “It’s a terrific opportunity to get youngsters with ideas to help us to innovate.”One of the main differences between school leavers and graduates lies in the level of pastoral care the firm provides. “At 18, an age difference of three of four years is significant and as an employer we provide appropriate levels of support. Youngsters are not as well-rounded or resilient and we’ve got a pool of former school leavers to help via our buddying system.”Rob Fryer, head of student recruitment at Deloitte, echoes the need to provide additional support for school leavers. “It’s quite different for a business that’s used to graduates,” he says. “The profile of school leavers is very similar in terms of capabilities, intelligence, aptitude for work and enthusiasm but they are three or four years younger than graduates, who are more used to working on their own and being independent, so we had to implement pastoral care.”It takes school leavers two extra years to catch up with graduates on Deloitte’s programme. “After that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” he says.While a lot of attention has focused recently on opportunities for school leavers, graduates are expected to remain central to many accountancy firms’ ground-floor recruiting policies, says Ms Bingham of EY. “Arguably, in our advisory business, degrees are more useful,” she says.The audit function at KPMG is still “predominantly graduate but less so than before”, says Alison Heron, head of student recruitment. “Diversity and social mobility” are the main drivers behind its school-leavers programme, she adds.The firm hires up to 600 graduates a year and about 150 school leavers through a programme offering a free university degree, a chartered accountancy qualification, and a salary starting at about £20,000.University is not for everyone, says Kate Newton, recruitment director for Accenture in the UK and Ireland, the management consultancy. It was not a choice between either graduates or school leavers but offering different routes to join the firm, she says.“The core skills are the same: the ability to communicate, problem solving, and collaboration, whether you’re a graduate, apprentice or intern,” she says. “For us, it’s about early engagement. Hiring the best and the brightest is a mantra for us.”Her main advice to any young person is: “Try it before you buy it.” This means seeking internships and all opportunities and not just thinking university is the only route to a rewarding career.Mr Fryer of Deloitte acknowledges that many young people are under pressure from parents and careers advisers to pursue academic careers. “Our message is to think about what you want, whether you want to start making money or to have the university experience,” he says.“We’re aware there’s a lot of pressure from young people’s peers, parents and teachers because of the view that university is best if you’re academically able – but it’s up to you to decide.”


Choosing work: ‘We get a lot of support’Gabriella Saponara, 20, is in her first year of the EY school-leaver programme. In addition to studying for her professional qualifications, she works with EY’s transaction tax team, which provides advice to clients on activities such as the acquisition and disposal of businesses and companies.She receives hands-on client experience and supports the team on a range of activities, including developing pitches for new client projects.Ms Saponara found out about the programme at a sixth-form careers day. She had been worried about debts of up to £50,000 if she went to university. “I always knew I wanted to work for a global firm and by doing this five-year programme, I qualify one year earlier than a graduate,” she says.Her starting salary was £21,5000 and she is pleased not to be in debt. She is also reassured to find that some of the firm’s partners do not have a degree.The transaction team has been warm and welcoming. “We get a lot of support. Each of us has a buddy, mentor and counsellor and there are school-leaver groups.“I’m also a school-leaver ambassador and we speak on behalf of all school leavers,” she says.“We recently had some summer interns who were in their second year at university but I was the one showing them around,” she says. “That’s when I knew this is really going to work out for me.”Ryan Bright, 19, became a higher apprentice at PwC after worrying that university might not give him full value for money and he wanted to get on the career ladder as early as possible. If he does well, he is guaranteed a place on the firm’s graduate scheme, so he does not feel he is missing out on opportunities.“I’m really enjoying it and you’re given a lot of responsibilities. I feel stretched and challenged,” he says. “I’m surrounded by people with a lot of experience and you’re not left to your own devices, like at university.”Choosing university: ‘I felt my career would benefit’Jonathan McElhatton, 24, joined Accenture last year after studying at Southampton university for a science degree and Edinburgh university for his masters, specialising in climate science and carbon management.“I was always a high achiever and enjoyed education so it was an easy choice to go from sixth form to university,” he says.He also knew he wanted to have a specialism, saying “carbon management is understanding climate science”, but he was also interested in business.“At Accenture, everything is challenging – as is to be expected when joining a large firm. Training and skills development are key and there’s a wide range of graduates at Accenture,” he says. “We have access to senior colleagues who help us to get a strong foundation.”Ben Davison, 23, graduated with the help of PwC through its Flying Start, employer-led degree route. “I wouldn’t have taken a standard degree because of the cost and I did look at apprenticeships but I found this course where you’re paid and get work placements.”He likens the programme to a pyramid, because he can follow his progression year-by-year, which he finds satisfying. “You can move on to more senior roles and get more engagement and responsibility,” he says.“I wouldn’t change anything and I thought it was a fantastic degree programme, the way you get work placements and access to first-class clients.”Harry Organ is in the second year of KPMG’s graduate programme that targets state school pupils. He is based in its Birmingham office and is studying for his degree at Exeter University. He had previously spent school holidays working in a local accountancy firm, proving his commitment to his career choice.“I felt my career would benefit from a degree and widen my opportunities,” he says. “The KPMG programme was a no-brainer because I was going to study accountancy and apply to the big four in my third year anyway.”Although he has less time off than traditional undergraduates – he gets 25 days off like any other employee – he says this is offset by being paid."
90;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-10-15T22:47:43Z;Management: Added value replaces saving cash as spur to contracting out;Streamlining of systems can deliver considerable benefits;Hiring retail staff used to be a labour-intensive task for shop managers at Levi Strauss, the clothing company, which has 1,900 stores worldwide. Senior staff spent hours posting jobs online, attending recruitment events and dealing with paperwork.Delegating recruitment to a business process outsourcing (BPO) provider means that managers have 300,000 fewer pieces of paper a year to process. It has reduced errors by 60 per cent and occurrences of “missing information” by 30 per cent.Levi Strauss has been able to beat the competition at hiring key staff during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons, says Mike Salvino, group chief executive of BPO at Accenture, the outsourcing company which worked with the jeans maker.BPO involves the contracting out of specific business functions. It was first introduced for activities such as manufacturing or running the supply chain and then moved on to non-core and back-office functions in areas such as human resources, finance and procurement.As with traditional outsourcing, BPO was originally about saving money.Now businesses are looking for more value in the form of insight and innovation, says Mr Salvino.He says: “They are asking BPO service providers: ‘What can you do to improve my business performance?’”At Levi Strauss, Accenture provides analytics and reporting, project management, human resources software and training. “The company can now monitor and assess its retail recruitment programme, improve demand forecasting, resolve bottlenecks and optimise spending,” Mr Salvino says.Jameel Khokhar, director of shared services and outsourcing at KPMG Management Consulting, agrees that BPO concerns much more than cutting costs: “Today, the focus is more on achieving greater speed to market and faster decision making. It also helps organisations become more open and collaborative.”This has been the experience of the brand teams at Procter & Gamble, which is using BPO to develop packaging for 90 per cent of its products, from Pampers and Duracell to Olay. The service includes the development and operation of P&G’s 20 design studios worldwide.Here BPO is used to create 3D simulations and has brought timescales down to days or hours instead of weeks or months. It has enabled P&G designers to model 150 virtual stores, in partnership with retailers, to study how products look on the shelves.Another example is Microsoft, which has reduced the cost of procurement and finance for 90 subsidiaries worldwide by 35 per cent, while giving staff more time for other activities.Many organisations have systems that are not integrated, where there is a large amount of duplication, and they have overlapping inconsistent systems and operating procedures, says Rahul Singh, president of business and financial services at HCL Technologies, a BPO provider.“HCL reduced costs by 40 per cent for an international bank with processes such as this across 47 countries in areas such as accounts payable, billing and fixed asset accounting,” Mr Singh says.But BPO entails risks. Some organisations have outsourced too much, says KPMG’s Mr Khokhar. “Their in-house understanding of operational systems and technology developments becomes limited so they can no longer oversee third parties.”This can cause a retreat, Mr Khokhar says. “Some companies are pulling back, as they reassess the optimal balance between in-house and external capability.”The consequences of getting the balance wrong can be loss of brand identity and ignorance of problem areas in the business.“Ironically, this is causing high-growth businesses in emerging markets such as India and China – the providers of many outsourcing services – to retain in-house talent and competitive advantage by not outsourcing key processes or technologies that give them competitive advantage,” Mr Khokhar says. Social media, mining and analytics are among the activities kept in-house.Data security is a problem. Organisations should take this very seriously, says Jonathan Cooper-Bagnall, head of PA Consulting’s outsourcing practice. “They need to be sure they know what information is being outsourced, where it is being stored and who has access to it.”This is particularly important for new enterprises that may be looking for low-cost BPO options from large commoditised service providers, Mr Cooper-Bagnall says.“With these providers, it may be hard for clients to gain insight into what sort of security measures are in place,” he adds.On the other hand, unless individual companies have world-class protection from cyber attack, BPO providers are often a safer place to keep data.In the most progressive BPO relationships, new forms of business value are emerging, says Mr Salvino. These include improving customer satisfaction, increasing working capital and revenue generation, and optimising costs and profit and loss performance.
91;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-10-15T22:47:43Z;Service providers: India’s earnings landmark leads to introspection;The aftermath of the financial crisis has been difficult;India’s IT outsourcing sector earned $100bn in revenues for the first time in 2013. For an industry barely three decades old, this ought to have prompted celebrations. Instead, it seemed to herald doubts and introspection.The nation’s software development sector grew by 10.5 per cent in the last financial year, trade body Nasscom says. This sounds healthy, but it undershot industry projections for the second year running. The growth rate was double that in 2011. As recently as 2007, the rate of expansion had been a heady 33 per cent.Much of the slowdown stems from weaker growth in Europe and the US, the markets to which India’s larger IT houses, such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro, export most of their services – such as building, running and fixing complex software systems for multinationals.Yet even beyond this, the sector appears to be suffering from growing pains as it struggles to develop more sophisticated and lucrative products, or to expand into foreign markets.Some companies have been particularly affected, most notably Bangalore-based Infosys. In the face of repeated accusations of management drift, the one-time industry bellwether in June recalled from retirement one of its celebrated co-founders, Narayana Murthy, as part of an attempt to recover ground lost to competitors.At one level this sense of doubt is surprising, given the insistence of senior executives at India’s IT houses that demand for their services is increasing quickly. Global businesses continue to seek to reduce costs and restructure operations, processes that inevitably involve updating or adapting IT systems.“From the sector’s point of view, and from ours, as well we continue to see lots of opportunities,” says Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chief executive of Mumbai-based TCS, the country’s largest software house by revenue. “Companies around the globe, in many different industries, are being driven by adoption of technology on the one side and the need for efficiencies on the other.”From this standpoint, the building blocks that stimulated the early phase of India’s IT revolution remain in place, not least the cost advantage that comes from outsourcing IT work to a county where engineering talent is plentiful and labour relatively cheap.Yet even industry optimists admit the aftermath of the global financial crisis has been difficult.Demand for technology services keeps rising but spending has not always kept pace, as companies trim budgets.According to research group Gartner, total global IT costs will remain static this year at around $450bn. “Clients under budget pressures look to pass them downwards to the supply chain, leading to squeezes on the suppliers’ profit margins,” says Kit Burden, a partner at professional services firm DLA Piper.Indian software groups have also made slow progress expanding into emerging nations such as Brazil or China – seen by many as an important source of future growth – and into industrial economies, such as Japan, where fewer companies have traditionally chosen to outsource.As a result, India’s industry still remains vulnerable to sudden changes in its main western export markets, be that slowdowns in spending or more specific problems, such as pending legislative changes in the US likely to make it harder for Indian IT workers to obtain temporary visas.More worrying still has been the industry’s limited success moving upmarket. Some, including Infosys, have attempted to mimic western services companies such as IBM and Accenture by combining IT services with more sophisticated offerings, including management consulting. But as yet, such ventures contribute a tiny slice of the company’s overall revenues.Industry figures such as Mr Chandrasekaran stress the progress their companies have made expanding into more technologically complex services, such as mobile computing or data analytics. DLA Piper’s Mr Burden cites cloud computing as another potential growth area, as companies increasingly turn to complex software packages offered over the internet by companies such as Salesforce.com, rather than hiring outsourcing groups to run in-house packages.Adapting to such trends is crucial if India’s outsourcing companies are to prosper in the long term, even as more immediate factors may be turning in their favour.The sector has performed relatively well in recent months, aided by repeated declines in the value of the rupee, which has boosted dollar revenues that companies earn abroad. A return to growth in both the US and the eurozone should help to improve performance in the coming quarters as well, say Citigroup analysts.Nonetheless, when Mr Murthy returned to Infosys this year he described his comeback as a “second innings” – one that it seems will take place in more challenging circumstances than the first.
92;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-10-08T10:15:26Z;You definitely can’t have it all…;;"This week I hosted FT columnist Heather McGregor (aka Mrs Moneypenny) at a women’s networking dinner sponsored by Accenture. Addressing an audience of about 60 or so ambitious women, she walked us through the main tenets of her new book Sharpen your heels: Mrs.Moneypenny’s career advice for women, in her usual no-nonsense fashion.As a fan of the book, (a driving force behind my decision to embark on the EMBA), I listened to her words of wisdom, mentally reapplying them to my new life as an EMBA student. But, as I got up to thank her, it dawned on me that I had failed to comprehend the most important lesson in the book – you can’t have it all.Although targeted at a female audience the lesson has great relevance to those undertaking EMBA programmes; in my all-singing, all-dancing, over-achieving class I’m not alone in believing I can have it all, despite some painful lessons in term one.What has differentiated the EMBA for me and many of my colleagues is the timing. The mid-thirties are the conflux of career making opportunities and family life additions. This calls for a different approach.McGregor’s advice is simple but accurate. ‘Understand what matters to you, release unrealistic expectations and be wary of the impacts of your choices’. Spreading yourself too thin can lead to a lack of focus, this will hold back your career or provide a reputation you don’t want. Doing something badly, knowing you could have done better, creates disappointment and residual guilt. Being the person at the back of the class checking emails, is lose – lose, the professors will dock points for class participation and work will see your emails as a signal that it is business as usual.When deciding what to prioritise I like to project myself into the future and take a long-term view. Clay Christensen’s book How will you measure your life? is great food for thought on this.Accepting I can’t have it all will be a journey. Reassessing and realigning priorities, getting rid of guilt and saying ‘no’ are all part of that. So far I’ve found some innovative ways to combine work, study and the programme, but in a year of immense opportunity this is still a hard task and will take time to get rightAlongside the academia, the life lessons the EMBA journey provides are equally rewarding, but unfortunately more painful to learn."
93;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-09-20T16:11:00Z;Logic of outsourcing can be hard to resist;Outsourcing is not an easy option but can give businesses flexibility to grow;For every complicated problem, the journalist HL Mencken said, there is a solution that is neat, plausible, and wrong. When outsourcing first became a popular business practice two decades ago, some executives mistakenly believed they had found a neat solution that was plausible, and right.While there were obvious “cost arbitrage” savings to be made by taking a business unit out of a high-wage area and transporting the activity to an emerging market – the so-called “lift and shift” approach – it turned out that life was more complicated than that.Outsourcing was not and is not an easy option. Contracts take a lot of managing. Cheaper will not necessarily mean more efficient, and more efficient will not necessarily mean more effective. The “people factor” is significant. Service level agreements have to be monitored and maintained. And initial cost savings can be eroded as wages rise in rapidly developing economies.In any case, intelligent outsourcing is no longer simply about cost savings. “That’s just ‘table stakes’,” says Anoop Sagoo, senior managing director at Accenture, the consulting firm. “We’ve moved on a long way from what people used to think about when they discussed outsourcing,” he says.For example, during last year’s London Olympic Games, Accenture’s digital team helped Procter & Gamble run a global marketing campaign (“Thank You Mom”, right) to coincide with its sponsorship of the games. This was part of what has become a large and important outsourcing relationship between P&G and Accenture.The consultants provide virtual retail outlets where P&G customers see different ways in which products can be presented. Accenture people run product websites, monitor emails and carry out customer service, but as far as customers are concerned they deal with P&G.“This is not just a ‘cost-out’ play, this is a capability play,” says Accenture’s Mr Sagoo. On winning an award for innovation in outsourcing this summer Patrick Kern, P&G’s director of business intelligence in global business services, said that the deal with Accenture was “a partnership in which one plus one equals five”. Well, he had just won an award.Another interesting aspect of current thinking on outsourcing is the way it forces (or should force) businesses to ask hard and fundamental questions about how they operate, and what sort of business they really are. If growth is the ultimate goal this matters.Jonathan Cooper-Bagnall, head of shared services and outsourcing at PA Consulting, says that intelligent outsourcing can provide businesses with the sort of flexibility they need to be able to compete successfully, and grow.“In the wake of the financial crisis, some companies have cut their cost base very deep, and are not in a position to rebuild that cost base,” he says. “So they have to use third parties in a smart way.You can build quickly, fail fast and move on if necessary“Say you were a bank or a retailer setting up in a new market. Do you really need to build your own systems, hire all your own people,” he asks.“The outsourcing route allows you to use a third party to build a platform ahead of the competition, and not struggle with legacy structures,” he adds. “You can do this flexibly, for two to three years rather than seven, build quickly, fail fast and move on if necessary.”Mr Cooper-Bagnall goes further. “What is really core to your business? Do you need your own R&D team? Or are you really a branding company? Other people can handle logistics, procurement, do the product development – your job is to market it.” This is where the logic of outsourcing ultimately takes you. How and where do you create value?But before selling a too optimistic version of outsourcing, Mr Cooper-Bagnall adds: “The talent needed to run these [outsourced] operations is in short supply, and expensive. Business acumen, managing suppliers, and those other sorts of relationship skills, are rarely found in one individual. How do you find and develop people for these roles? It’s not easy.”In order to avoid classic outsourcing pitfalls, it is worth asking what the common characteristics of successful attempts to outsource are - Accenture has listed these in a report.It suggests, an “end-to-end” approach is needed. That means not simply looking at one business process or unit in isolation, but seeing how the outsourced function fits into the rest of the organisation. Second, “collaborative governance” is necessary. This means forming a constructive partnership with the provider of outsourced services.Talent to run outsourced operations is in short supply and expensiveChange management should be a priority, according to the report. Outsourcing is a kind of change management programme in disguise, it says, with all the hazards that attend them. Microsoft’s 2006 OneFinance reorganisation of its global accounting, finance and procurement function – a seven-year deal with Accenture – is an example.The focus should be on value and not just cost reduction, the report adds. Long-term business outcomes, not just more efficient transactions in the short to medium term, should be the priority. Expertise in the domain will be needed and the ability to analyse data effectively – which is the point made by PA Consulting’s Mr Cooper-Bagnall.Relationships with those not being outsourced – the “retained organisation” – matter too, the report advises. As Accenture’s Mr Sagoo explains: “In a finance department, accountants are accountants and they will do what they do. You will have to reorganise and train them to do something else if that is what the new structure demands.”Finally – and obviously – make sure technology is used intelligently to drive operational improvements.Outsourcing is not the answer to everything. It can be taken too far. Companies can lose control – or “sight” – of far-flung operations. And some activities will, or should, always remain core.But the logic of outsourcing can be hard to resist. And for those looking to grow quickly, flexibly and sustainably, it is an unavoidable option.The writer is visiting professor in management practice at Cass Business School, London
94;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-09-17T16:01:50Z;Business innovation: Mobile payment systems face integration difficulties;Banks need to look beyond providing basic services;The problems and opportunities that mobile banking and payment systems, and electronic wallets, present for banks, card issuers, network operators and equipment makers are likely to vary from market to market and country to country.For example, in emerging markets such as Kenya and Tanzania, M-Pesa, the mobile phone-based money transfer and micro payment systems pioneered by Safaricom and Vodacom, has been popular with those who have not previously used banking services. M-Pesa allows users with a national ID card or passport to deposit, withdraw, and transfer money easily with a mobile device.In more developed countries, banks have offered basic mobile banking services for years. These are growing in sophistication, for example by allowing clients to use smartphone cameras to make cheque deposits, or by providing stock market investors with equity research and portfolio analysis tools on tablet devices.But the real opportunities for banks lie beyond basic banking services. As Accenture, the consultancy, noted in a report on the sector, “rapid advances in technology are creating major opportunities for banks to build better and more loyal relationships with their customers, enhance service and drive additional revenue”.Accenture also said banks are raising expectations about how customers interact with them, including “developing new services and addressing new points of customer interaction – for example through social media such as Facebook and Twitter”.But the authors point out that, while such innovation in specific channels is necessary for growth, it will not, on its own, be sufficient. “Introducing new channels or enhancing existing ones has to take place alongside the creation of architecture that brings those channels together and integrates customer data meaningfully across them all.“Without that integration it will not be possible to deliver the type of service experience that customers expect. And all of this has to deliver sustainable cost savings.”However, banks need to take advantage of such opportunities sooner rather than later, or they run the risk of being outflanked by mobile network operators and companies such as PayPal, that are also zeroing in on mobile banking and payments. For example, Berg Insight, a business intelligence company, estimates in-store mobile wallet payments will reach a combined total of €78bn in North America and Europe alone by 2017, up from just €600m in 2012.Berg suggests commercial mobile wallet services will be operating in nearly half of the 27 EU members, plus Switzerland and Norway, by the end of this year. Many of Europe’s largest mobile operators, banks and retailers including T-Mobile, Orange, Telefónica, BNP Paribas, Barclays and Auchan, were identified by Berg as important mobile wallet players.In North America, where mobile wallets have been slow to take off, their use in in-store payments totalled just $500m in 2012, and the vast majority of payments used Starbucks’ smartphone application. Mobile wallets that can be used at multiple merchants “have yet to gain traction”, according to Berg.But this could be about to change. Isis, the mobile commerce joint venture created by AT&T Mobility, T-Mobile US and Verizon Wireless, announced plans at the end of July to roll out its Isis Mobile Wallet nationwide this year, following successful trials in Austin, Texas and Salt Lake City, Utah.Michael Abbott, Isis’s chief executive says: “Over the past nine months, we have proven the power of an open platform, creating an ecosystem of hundreds of partners dedicated to making mobile commerce a reality.”In another indication that the Isis Mobile Wallet, which uses near-field communication technology to allow consumers to make purchases, redeem coupons and present loyalty cards with a tap of their smartphone, could win wider acceptance, Chase, the US banking arm of JPMorgan Chase, plans to offer its credit card services in the package.In the longer term, universal mobile wallets are expected to drive the majority of mobile in-store purchases in North America, which Berg estimates will reach $44bn by 2017.However, some believe that it will be the value-added services that accompany mobile wallet shopping that will truly distinguish mobile wallets from the traditional payment instruments.Jennifer Miles, president of VeriFone Americas, an Isis partner, says: ”The value in mobility is not in how you pay, it’s about creating a more meaningful and rewarding interaction between a brand and its customer, and mobile wallets are an important part of that.”Analysts think the next few years will be a crucial time for banks and others planning to offer mobile payment and wallet services.The Berg report said: “Gaining an early lead in the market can be crucial, as in the long term only a limited number of mobile wallet services will survive in each market due to network effects.”
95;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-09-11T21:01:06Z;Taxpayer at risk of more losses from unusable technology;;The prospect of further substantial taxpayer losses from unsuitable IT for the Universal Credit programme was raised on Wednesday when the acting head of the Major Projects Authority told MPs they could reach “at least” £140m.Norma Wood, interim MPA director general, told the public accounts committee that there was a question over how much of the technology built for pilot programmes by contractors such as Accenture and HP could be reused as Universal Credit was rolled out nationally.But the suggestion was disputed by senior officials from the department for work and pensions who argued that their own more detailed inquiries suggested that a large amount of the IT spending could be salvaged.Mike Driver, DWP finance director general, said it was “possible we will have to impair more of our assets” but he was unable to be more precise until a review of the programme by its new director, Howard Shiplee, had been completed.Mr Shiplee said he believed there was “substantial utility” in the IT already created.A £34m writedown has already taken place, after consultations with the suppliers. Ms Wood had earlier agreed with MPs’ assertions that this amounted to allowing the companies to “mark their own homework”.But Mr Driver rejected the characterisation saying: “The impairment review we did was audited by the National Audit Office.”However, Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, intervened to say that, until a fuller audit had been completed, “we don’t regard an adequate impairment review as having been conducted”.In tense exchanges with MPs, Robert Devereux , DWP permanent secretary, admitted he had found out about the extent of the problems besetting the programme only in summer 2012, when he realised there was “a cumulative bow wave of things that hadn’t been resolved”.Richard Bacon, a Tory member of the committee, told Mr Devereux that, given the “litany” of problems revealed by the NAO, including “inadequate financial controls and supplier driven changes in costs”, he found it “extraordinary” that the official had not appreciated the scale of the problems afflicting the programme at an earlier stage.Suggesting he had been foiled by the “good news” culture of the team running the programme, Mr Devereux – who had held discussions with the then-programme director “every two to three weeks” – said: “I put people in who were the best I had available and had the requisite track experience.”It also emerged that an external investigation by PwC, the professional services firm, into the programme’s financial controls had found that in 15 instances, a personal assistant had authorised payments to suppliers.But Mr Driver said that although someone had “pressed the authorise button” after inputting details into the system, and should not have done so, more senior members of staff had already gone through the “appropriate process” to determine the payments should be made.
96;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-09-06T10:51:37Z;Innovative ways to solve the MBA funding problem…;;"This week I decided to do a little research of my own. Curious to understand how my classmates had navigated the funding hurdle I embarked on some face-to-face surveying.A quick audit of our class provided me with some indicative statistics; just over half had self-funded (combination of savings and parental support), 10 per cent had used educational loans and the rest were largely corporately funded.It also introduced me to Mary… Mary, a venture capitalist from Switzerland had decided to do the MBA back in 2011. Armed with a top GMAT score and offers from a range of business schools she drew on her professional skills to manage an MBA fund-raising campaign, starting with friends and family and then transitioning to work colleagues and acquaintances.Her pitch was simple; if you believe I have the potential to be successful, invest in my future and be rewarded as I progress. The payback terms were straightforward – a return of the principal plus a percentage of her wage increase.When she explained her proposal I was initially sceptical. Would friends and family have seen me as a good investment opportunity? Would anyone even invest? And if they did, would it be through obligation rather than choice?I had personally been fortunate enough to secure a contribution from my employer, Accenture, but keen to fund the gap and curious to understand my appeal as an investment opportunity I embarked on a second survey.Starting with close family I began my questioning, seeking to understand who might invest and how much. Potential investors fell into two categories; my mother, who had spent years investing without a sniff of payback now keen to benefit, and others, who viewed me as an investment opportunity for which they were fortunate enough to be insiders.
For the latter, watching me over the years take on challenges and strive to achieve gave them enough information to invest confidently. My fears that people would feel obliged through affiliation, as I often did, receiving ‘just-giving emails’ before marathon season, were allayed. On the contrary, they saw this purely as a sound investment opportunity in which they would enjoy reaping the emotional and financial rewards.
The exercise was insightful, through positioning myself as an investment opportunity I had increased my chance of MBA success; with the hard-earned savings of friends and family invested in my future I had an even greater compulsion to do well and a cadre of investors to call upon for advice and support."
97;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Spending watchdog criticises Duncan Smith’s welfare shake-up;;"The government’s flagship welfare reform programme has been blighted by “weak management, ineffective control and poor governance”, according to a damning indictment by an independent spending watchdog.The report into Universal Credit, which rolls six existing benefits into a single payment, will intensify pressure on Iain Duncan Smith.The programme was the welfare secretary’s brainchild and is intended to ensure that people are always better off in work than on the dole.Ministers have presented the £2.4bn project as evidence of their radical approach to overhauling the welfare state.However, in an unremittingly critical assessment, the National Audit Office highlights a lack of both strategic vision and consistent leadership and questions whether the hoped-for benefits will be fully realised.Mr Duncan Smith hit back on Thursday morning, telling the BBC that the problems had been fixed, insisting: “This will be delivered within budget and within the timescale.”The NAO says officials were unable to explain how an ambitious target for a full national rollout this October – since abandoned – had been set or its feasibility evaluated.“Throughout the programme the [Department for Work and Pensions] has lacked a detailed view of how Universal Credit is meant to work,” adds the NAO, which complains of a “fortress” mentality among those assigned to the programme and “a culture of ‘good news’ reporting that limited open discussion of risks and stifled challenge.”The NAO says the department “took risks” to try to meet the short timescale and used a new project management approach “which it had never before used on a programme of this size and complexity”.It complains of a lack of IT expertise and consistent leadership; five different officials have consecutively taken overall responsibility for Universal Credit since mid-2012.The DWP has already written off more than £34m of its new IT systems and, despite spending more than £300m on systems development, does not know whether these are capable of supporting the programme once it is rolled out, says the report.Deficiencies include the lack of a component to identify potentially fraudulent claims, so that the department has to rely on multiple manual checks. “Such checks will not be feasible or adequate once the system is running nationally,” it says.Financial control of suppliers – which include HP, IBM and Accenture – was also inadequate, including payments being made without proper checks, although an external review had not uncovered any evidence of “inappropriate charging”, said the NAO.The report casts serious doubt on whether it can now meet its planned timetable of full implementation within the next four years.“Delays to the roll-out will reduce the expected benefits of reform and – if the department maintains a 2017 completion date – increase risks by requiring the rapid migration of a large volume of claimants,” says the report.In a sign of increasing Cabinet concern, the report discloses that a cross-government ministerial group, including representatives from the Treasury and the Cabinet Office, has taken greater control of big decisions since February.The department is now revising its plans and will present a new business case to the Treasury for approval towards the end of the year.Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, said: “If the government doesn’t get its act together we could be on course for yet another catastrophic government IT failure.” She had “no confidence that we will see the £38bn of predicted benefits between 2010-11 and 2022-23”.The DWP said: “Universal Credit is a major and complex reform that will transform the welfare state and we are committed to delivering it on time by 2017 and within budget.”Liam Byrne, shadow welfare secretary, said: “Mr Duncan Smith swore blind this benefit shake-up was fine. Now we learn he has completely lost control of his department at a potential cost of hundreds of millions of pounds.”An aide to Mr Duncan Smith pointed out that the report did not criticise him directly. As soon as he had realised that all was not well with the programme last summer, he had acted to bring in external expertise and advice and to tackle the “good news” culture in the department, said the official."
98;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-08-28T18:10:38Z;The strategy consultants in search of a strategy;Consultancy is in a funk as midsized partnerships realise they have to do something to survive;Did you hear the one about the strategy consultancy that could not work out a strategy for itself? It might make chief executives being billed $500 an hour for the wisdom of McKinsey & Co or Boston Consulting Group chuckle, but it is not a joke for the industry.Consultancy is in a funk as midsized partnerships with venerable names, such as Booz & Co and Roland Berger, realise they have to do something but cannot decide on what. Just carrying on is not an option – they face the spectre of Monitor, the consultancy that went bankrupt last year, and was bought by Deloitte for only $120m.There is not a palatable choice. Merging with another firm, as Booz considered with AT Kearney, would invite a clash of cultures. They are not generating enough cash to join the big league with McKinsey, BCG and Bain & Co. And some partners cannot face being absorbed by a big accountancy or technology firm such as Deloitte or Accenture.The partners of Roland Berger, the German strategy firm that has never quite gone global, have put back a decision, having almost agreed to be acquired by Deloitte in 2010 and then had second thoughts. At that time, the partners and its founder invested in expansion instead.So the strategists are in a strategy hole. As Oscar Wilde remarked of Charles Dickens’ The Old Curiosity Shop: “One must have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing.”It is not only consultants that face these difficulties – other kinds of professional partnerships are in a bind. In a lower-growth world, they are pressed to pay big bonuses to retain their revenue-earning partners while opening new offices to serve global companies.If they take on debt to bridge the gap, they can enter a downward spiral. In the legal profession, this happened to Dewey & LeBoeuf, the New York law firm that collapsed last year after borrowing $200m to finance its growth.Consulting, which was used to double-digit growth before the 2008 financial crisis, now faces its own reckoning. “The dirty little secret of consultancy is there are no profits. They all get paid out to partners,” says one such partner.The firms being squeezed are the midsized consultants that lack scale but have higher costs than specialist boutiques. On one estimate, a global consultancy firm needs annual revenues of at least $2bn both to pay its partners and to invest enough and, according to Kennedy Consulting Research and Advisory, only McKinsey, BCG and Bain met that hurdle in 2011.The money goes to pay partners between $1.2m and $1.5m a year and invest up to a further $500,000 per partner on developing staff and adding services. Booz and AT Kearney had revenues of $930m in 2011 and Roland Berger $1.2bn, so none is big enough.The big three have another advantage – each has passed through the dangerous phase when the founding partners leave and their successors buy them out. Bain nearly collapsed in the early 1990s after Bill Bain’s transition landed it with excess debt. It only survived when Mitt Romney became chief executive and the debt was restructured.Roland Berger’s partners have paid down old debt by giving up bonuses, while Booz has the opposite problem. It has a clean balance sheet since a 2008 deal under which Carlyle Group bought Booz Allen Hamilton, the technology consultant that formerly employed Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency consultant. But the split left it too small to thrive.If anything, the big three have gained from this turmoil. Their revenues are growing in double digits after a post-crisis dip in 2009, and they can recruit from weaker firms. McKinsey, which has 1,400 partners and revenues of $5bn, is of a different scale to the mid-tier.That is vital in developing the business. Only a minority of what strategy consultants now do is blue-sky thinking for CEOs. Two decades ago, 70 per cent of McKinsey’s revenues were from strategy and corporate finance but most now flow from hands-on work on risk, operations and marketing.They are far smaller than the accounting firms that want to expand their consulting arms again, having previously focused on audit work, and big technology and outsourcing consultants. These often employ hundreds of thousands of people on vast outsourcing projects.But they are beyond reach of mid-tier firms, which are struggling to come to terms with this reality. It is not easy, since meetings of strategy partners to decide on strategy tend to degenerate into strident debates that go nowhere and end in a vote to postpone the decision.The easiest option would be to sell to a technology or accounting giant that covets a premium strategy firm to gain an entrée to CEOs and decision makers. “It is alluring to the point of intoxicating for them to acquire such a business,” says Tom Rodenhauser, Kennedy’s managing director for research.That probably sounds good to partners who are close to retiring and would like a payout. But younger partners tend to be less keen on being swallowed up by a big machine, and employed as glorified sales people. The last effort to combine a strategy consultant with a technology firm – EDS and AT Kearney– was a failure.The longer the mid-tier firms delay, however, the more vulnerable they become to partners leaving and confidence evaporating. Here’s some free strategic advice for them: make up your minds.john.gapper@ft.com——————————————-Letter in response to this column:Henderson’s Rule of Three and Four / From Mr Phil Deane
99;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Bridging the marketing and IT disconnect;;Companies are missing out on the opportunity to improve their relationships with customers because their information technology and marketing chiefs are not working well together, according to a report published today by Accenture, the IT services group.A survey of 400 senior marketing and 250 IT executives in 10 countries found that only one in 10 believe collaboration between their corporate functions is sufficient.The report, titled “The CMO-CIO Disconnect”, says that corporate IT leaders appear to be more committed to greater collaboration than their marketing counterparts. While 77 per cent of chief information officers (CIOs) surveyed believe working with their advertising counterparts is important, only 57 per cent of chief marketing officers (CMOs) feel the same.But despite being more open to engaging, only 45 per cent of chief information officers believe it is high on their list of priorities.The study also reveals a degree of distrust between the two corporate functions. More than 30 per cent of chief marketing officers believe that IT keeps marketing out of the loop and does not make time and technical resources available. In addition, when IT does become involved, 36 per cent claim that the results fall short of their expectations.Conversely, almost half of the CIOs – 46 per cent – claim marketing does not provide an adequate level of detail for their business requirements.The survey also points to the ability of business leaders outside the IT department to sign up themselves for cloud-computing and other ‘shadow IT’ services without involving corporate IT, as another area of friction. While 45 per cent of CMOs say they want to enable their teams to leverage and optimise data and content without IT intervention, 49 per cent of CIOs counter that marketing uses technologies without consideration for IT standards.The gulf between the two functions is also apparent when they are asked about the main reasons they should collaborate. While marketing chiefs claim that gaining customer insight is their number one motivator for collaborating with IT, chief information officers rank this tenth on their list of reasons to work together. IT leaders say their top motivation for collaborating is to improve the customer experience, which their marketing counterparts rank as only their third most important motivator.“The CMO and CIO continue to work in silos, but now more than ever bridging the gap between those two organisations is critical for success,’ said Brian Whipple, global managing director of Accenture Interactive.Mr Whipple acknowledges that executives face a variety of challenges when collaborating, ranging from a lack of trust to differing business goals. But he says, “these issues must be resolved to turn a company’s digital marketing capabilities into a platform for market differentiation, business growth, and profitability.”The one positive to emerge from the Accenture study is that despite the collaboration issues raised by the survey, both 45 per cent of marketing executives and 47 per cent of corporate technology leaders believe their relationship has improved over the past year. Additionally, almost an equal number of CMOs (41 per cent) and CIOs (42 per cent) believe that significantly more collaboration with each other will be required to drive relevant customer experiences.In order to facilitate closer collaboration, Accenture argues that the CMO should be identified as the “chief experience officer’ and that IT should be looked at as a strategic partner with marketing and not just as a platform provider. In addition, Accenture says the skills mix in both organisations should be updated whereby the marketing department would become more tech savvy and the IT organisation would become more agile and responsive to market demands.
100;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-07-23T22:58:18Z;Business-style agency to run £12bn of government procurement;;A corporate-style overhaul of the way the government buys up to £12bn of goods and services will be announced today as ministers try to use the spur of austerity to change the way Whitehall operates and make savings of around £1bn a year.In a challenge to departmental autonomy, the purchase of “common services” – from travel to energy – will be delivered by a new executive agency, to be called the Crown Commercial Service.A prominent private sector figure is being sought to chair the organisation, which will start work in the autumn.Ministers and officials believe the government can use its aggregated purchasing power to achieve better deals for taxpayers, saving up to 10 per cent of procurement costs.Bigger suppliers – such as Capita, BT, Accenture and IBM – could potentially lose out as ministers look to smaller and more nimble companies to produce savings.Bill Crothers, chief procurement officer, said: “We will have a single, integrated, coherent organisation providing a commercial service to the rest of government and to the wider public sector.”The search for better ways of buying the range of supplies needed to keep the wheels of government turning has preoccupied administrations of different stripes for years. Previous attempts, however, have foundered, in part due to the reluctance of successive ministers to enforce central procurement on their colleagues.But Mr Crothers told the Financial Times that departments could now “see the benefit” of central purchasing, citing the contribution such savings had already made to meeting Treasury targets in the June spending review.In some instances, buying goods for the whole of government rather than a single department, and ensuring that all negotiations were undertaken by specialists in that field, had already shaved between 5 and 10 per cent off the expected price. “This is not a job for generalists,” said Mr Crothers, who held a senior position at Accenture before joining the civil service two years ago.The CCS is expected to cover its own operating costs, partly from “service fees” that will be paid by departments and the wider public sector. In addition, it will benefit from achieving bigger-than-projected savings, sharing in any gains beyond an agreed target.Soon after the coalition came to power, David Cameron commissioned Sir Philip Green, the high street retailer, to conduct a review of government procurement. In a damning assessment, he concluded that government was failing to leverage its buying power and there was inefficient buying by individual departments, with significant price variations across departments for common items.Earlier this month, a report commissioned by Francis Maude, minister to the Cabinet Office, from McKinsey, the management consultancy, backed the idea of centralised procurement.The CCS will initially take charge of the £10bn to £12bn a year spent on areas such as professional services and facilities management. In “common but complex” areas, such as IT, it would initially advise departments about how to secure better deals but eventually would “take responsibility for running all, or a lot of, ICT,” said Mr Crothers.However, specialised purchasing, for example of trains, prisons or the work programme which finds jobs for long-term unemployed, would remain within departments, he said.Mr Maude said the government’s commercial reforms had already saved the taxpayer £3.8bn. The CCS would give government “a much tighter grip on all aspects of its commercial performance, from market engagement through to contract management”.
101;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-07-16T23:01:26Z;Private sector: Online tools can boost chances of employment;Companies co-operate to train tomorrow’s workers;"Despite alarming global levels of youth unemployment, business investment in education remains inadequate, particularly in developing countries. Just how little the private sector invests emerged at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos.A paper released by Unesco, the UN cultural agency, found that the combined amount spent by corporations and private foundations on education in developing countries was just $683m a year.Many people in the corporate sector acknowledge this must change, and not just in developing countries, because, despite the record levels of joblessness among the young, companies often struggle to find qualified candidates to fill their vacancies.One programme in the Middle East is aiming to start turning the tide. The Jordan Education Initiative, which has support of businesses including Cisco, HP, Microsoft and IBM, uses IT to develop the skills students need to secure jobs. It not only equips schools in the country with computers, but also develops IT-based curriculums and teacher-training software packages.“As corporate enterprises, we are going to need to do our own re-skilling,” says Jeanne Beliveau-Dunn, head of the online learning network at equipment maker Cisco.The initiative demonstrates that the corporate sector can contribute more than in-house training and education funding – particularly if companies harness their internal capabilities to develop digital teaching methods and online educational content that can potentially be used by millions.However, some young people lack the most basic of skills. Here, too, technology can help. As part of its charitable Skills To Succeed programme, for example, Accenture, the professional services company, has developed games for teenagers based on its own business simulations.Users play the role of a character on screen and, as the game proceeds, make choices and receive coaching. Decisions might help them learn how to create a CV or find out what it is like to work in different sectors. Other options are designed to overcome some of the basic obstacles that young people face in finding and keeping a job. “It can be as simple as the fact that they don’t dress properly or they don’t use deodorants,” says Mike Byrne, head of talent and organisation performance for Accenture in the UK and Ireland.“The richer the content is and the more choices and options people have, the more powerful the learning technique,” he says.Employers are also recognising that the talents and attributes employees require are changing. Assessment & Teaching of 21st Century Skills, a project that brings together governments, schools, academics and industries, has identified four categories of necessary skills, says Anthony Salcito, head of education at Microsoft, one of the project’s sponsors.These are: how students think creatively; how they use tools and data to reach decisions; how they work collaboratively; and how they think about global issues. Technology plays a critical role in developing these skills. This is partly because routine training can be provided digitally, which means more time is available for face-to-face sessions to focus on so-called softer skills – personal traits that enhance a jobseeker’s employability, such as developing emotional intelligence.Mr Salcito says social media and other technologies have expanded learning opportunities.“Technology enables a level of collaboration that would have been hard to achieve outside a classroom in the past,” he says.Companies are turning to digital forms of education because they often need to train teams that are dispersed across the world and because employees today need constant access to education and training.“The world is changing so fast, industries are reinventing themselves, and your employees can’t sit still,” says Ms Beliveau-Dunn.In the absence of the regular, long-term jobs enjoyed by previous generations, IT training can equip people to start their own businesses, says Chris Coward, co-founder, of the University of Washington Information School’s technology and social change group.He sees potential in hybrid models. “People are learning through online courses, using social media to connect with each other on the course and using Meetup [a website that allows groups with similar interests to arrange meetings] to connect physically,” he says.However, while face-to-face encounters are likely to remain an important part of education, digital training has become a far richer experience than it used to be. Gone are the days when companies simply transferred materials from hard copy to a website.Today, whether courses are accessed via online video, gaming or social media sites, students and employees can now learn in virtual teams and participate in simulations rather than simply having to absorb information passively.“Collaboration and video are the breakthrough tools for the next century,” says Ms Beliveau-Dunn."
102;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Companies see innovation without results;;The vast bulk of corporate innovation initiatives are failing to deliver the results that senior executives expected.Despite increased investment in innovation, only 18 per cent of executives believe their company’s innovation efforts deliver a competitive advantage, according to a survey conducted by Accenture and published this week.The survey, based on responses from just over half the 519 companies spread across more than 12 industry sectors in France, the UK and the US, suggests that companies are struggling to turn investments designed to spur innovation into meaningful results, in part because they do not take enough risks.Among executives within the high tech sector, only 13 per cent of executives believe their respective companies’ innovation initiatives deliver a competitive advantage, although technology companies appear to be much more committed to innovation compared to executives from the 11 other industries.Overall, just over half the respondents said they had increased funding for innovation, and 93 per cent said the long-term success of their organisation’s strategy depends on their ability to innovate. Seventy per cent placed innovation among their company’s top five priorities.But despite this commitment, the report called “Why ‘Low Risk’ Innovation Is Costly”, found a decline in the satisfaction with innovation performance compared to the results of a similar Accenture study conducted in 2009.Among the main reasons that innovation results fall short, companies appear focused on relatively low-risk activities like extending product lines rather than pursuing new products and other breakthroughs.In fact, 64 per cent of respondents said they are focused on product-line extensions rather than big ideas, and the proportion of executives likely to identify the introduction of a new product category as a primary goal for innovation fell to just 27 per cent from 42 per cent in the 2009 study.Thirty-three per cent said their primary goal was the expansion of the product suites that support their basic offerings and 46 per cent of the executives said their company had become more risk averse when considering new ideas.“Many companies take a low-risk approach to innovation that can jeopardise results because they lack a prudent, disciplined approach for innovation risk management,” said Wouter Koetzier, managing director for Innovation and Product Development at Accenture. “It’s a situation compounded for many by an inability to rapidly scale inventions.”However, Mr Koetzier said the research also suggests that those companies that have a formal, end-to end management system designed to nurture, scale and launch innovations tend to be more satisfied with their results because they achieve stronger outcomes.
103;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-05-15T23:03:12Z;China in innovation challenge to Europe;;Europe’s business leaders fear its industry will fall behind China in technological innovation within a decade as the economic crisis undermines one of the continent’s competitive advantages.More than two-thirds of business leaders surveyed by Accenture, the consultancy, on behalf of BusinessEurope, the business lobby group, said China would reach or pull ahead of Europe in innovation by 2023.Weak demand caused by Europe’s economic crisis has sent industrial production into decline, while corporate reluctance to delve into cash reserves is holding back new investment, training and R&D.Rising unemployment threatens labour flexibility and Europe’s ability to maintain a highly skilled workforce. Fewer than half of those surveyed said Europe’s workforce remained a competitive advantage for industry.European policy makers are determined to reverse industry’s decline. The European Commission last year proposed by 2020 to raise industry’s share of EU gross domestic product from 15.6 per cent to 20 per cent.“We cannot continue to let our industry relocate outside Europe,” said Antonio Tajani, vice-president of the European Commission.European companies remain leaders in sectors ranging from automotive to aerospace, engineering to pharmaceuticals, and two-thirds of surveyed business leaders said European industry was still competitive internationally.But some Chinese companies such as Huawei, the telecoms equipment maker, are drawing level in innovation capability and gaining share in Europe. Some 61 per cent of those surveyed said they feared Europe would struggle to recover from its economic crisis for at least three years.Some 90 per cent of German business leaders said Europe’s industry was competitive compared with only half of business leaders in Spain.The Accenture study identified two areas to support growth: rebuilding Europe’s skills base and reinvigorating industry’s access to finance, including better access to capital markets and venture capital funding for start-ups.Although Europe is mired in recession, there remain opportunities in areas ranging from low-carbon technology and smart grid networks to biotechnology and advanced manufacturing.“The China machine is definitely going to invest a lot of money in technology innovation over the next 10 years . . . [But] there’s a sense that if we get our act together Europe can remain successful in manufacturing,” said Mark Spelman, strategy chief at Accenture.“Just because there is zero growth across Europe doesn’t mean there are not segments of good growth within that . . . So it’s about how you place bets in an intelligent way.To address the innovation deficit, business leaders want to see more public funding for R&D, reduced tax for R&D and capital investment and improved financing conditions.European executives raised a variety of other worries ranging from the cost of energy to labour costs.A majority of respondents were pessimistic that European industry would be cost-competitive in energy compared with markets such as the US, Russia and China in three years’ time.US industry is enjoying cheap energy courtesy of discoveries of shale gas that permit new investment in gas-intensive industry, such as petrochemicals.In contrast, Europe remains dependent on more expensive Russian gas, and costly regulation and investments in renewable energy are adding to the burden.Accenture commissioned a survey of 500 executives and public sector leaders in a variety of company sizes.
104;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Companies must cut through big data hype;Managers can learn far more from contacting and talking to lost customers;Along with more than 1,000 other north Londoners, I recently lost my landline. Others were worse off: they lost their internet connections too.Throughout the disruption, which lasted 10 days, many of us knew more about what was happening than the BT people we contacted.At first, the telecommunications company’s call-centre said the problem was outside my house. When, after four days, and in response to increasingly angry messages, a BT functionary called me on my mobile phone, all he could tell me was that the company had suffered from vandalism.By then we all knew, from the technicians who arrived three days after the incident, that a group dressed as telecoms engineers had dropped down a manhole, cut the lines in several places to get at the copper, and had fled empty-handed when the police arrived.A BT spokesman eventually confirmed all this (except for the thieves’ disguise, on which he declined to comment). He said cable-cutting triggered an alarm to the police, which is why they managed to prevent theft but not extensive damage.When I asked why this information did not appear on BT call-centre screens, he sheepishly agreed the company should share what it knew more widely.This is a modern pattern. Companies have never had so much information – on sales, weather and service breakdowns. And yet the more data they have, the less they seem to know.People on the spot – local technicians, shopkeepers or bank managers – understand their patch. When companies began to centralise information, they lost detail, nuance and often the basic facts.We should remember this as management and information technology consultants hype “big data” and attempt to panic companies into spending millions.“Analytics has arrived, is in wide use and is securely on the C-suite agenda,” says an Accenture report.McKinsey Quarterly adds: “When companies inject data and analytics deep into their operations, they can deliver productivity and profit gains that are 5 to 6 per cent higher than those of the competition.”Yet the same consultants report big data is a big disappointment. Accenture says only 22 per cent of companies are very satisfied with their analytics programmes, 35 per cent are quite satisfied and 34 per cent are dissatisfied. Only 39 per cent say the data they have are “relevant to the business strategy”. Companies have accumulated “a large set of metrics”, Accenture says, but adds: “Most organisations measure too many things that don’t matter, and don’t put sufficient focus on those that do.”McKinsey agrees that “companies are buried in information” and are struggling to use it.What should managers do? The consultants recommend they intensify their efforts. Accenture suggests companies start “embedding analytics into business processes in a robust, industrialised way”. McKinsey advocates “a large investment in new data capabilities”. And although they are too sophisticated to say so, the consultants clearly know the people who can help.The ability to study large trends and patterns is clearly useful. But it is no substitute for getting around the business and asking people, particularly frontline staff, what they think is happening.The data can tell you how many customers you have lost each month, but not necessarily why they have gone. You can do online surveys, which some may bother to complete, but you would learn far more from contacting and talking to some of those lost customers yourself.Computerised weather forecasts and sales data can tell you how many people are likely to be in your shops this weekend, but experienced store managers were making those calculations long before big data and iPads were thought of.The same goes for predicting individuals’ desires from their online behaviour – what Accenture calls “the market of one”. I have been an online shopper for 15 years and find vendors’ suggestions and targeted discounts plodding and predictable. The Financial Times cafeteria staff know more about my likes and dislikes than Amazon does.Big data can be useful, but only if you know what to look for and how to get it to the people who need it. You do need to know your business well to do that, but I suspect you already know it better than any IT or management consultant does.michael.skapinker@ft.com
105;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-04-29T21:48:16Z;Procurement chief accuses suppliers of ‘complacency’;;Whitehall’s head of procurement hit out at “complacency” among suppliers as he vowed to inject more commercial rigour into the way the government buys goods and services.Bill Crothers, procurement chief, said the appointment of six senior business people, known as crown representatives, would “help us regain commercial advantage” by working with companies to secure a better deal for the taxpayer.Mr Crothers, who works in the Cabinet Office, entered government after more than 20 years at Accenture, a management consultancy. He said: “We should be the best customer, we’ve got scale, we’ve got great credit, we pay on time and yet we don’t think we get . . . the best price or best terms.”He added: “I think there’s a degree of complacency that the suppliers have and it’s a paradox to me that we award them hundreds of millions of pounds of business each year and we don’t get treated as we would in a competitive market.”In contrast to the traditional Whitehall view, Mr Crothers said he would rather deal with executives experienced in private, rather than public, sector procurement.“When someone turns up from one of the companies and says ‘I’ve got 25 years’ public sector experience’, typically we score them top marks. I score them bottom marks because I would prefer someone who has experience of selling and delivering to a highly competitive market,” he said.The Financial Times reported last year that the Cabinet Office had introduced a system whereby companies judged to be “high risk” because they had underperformed on a previous contract would be barred from more work until problems had been addressed.The FT established that Fujitsu was among three placed in that category. Mr Crothers disclosed that no suppliers were currently on the list “although it doesn’t mean there won’t be in the future. We think the act of having the policy . . . in itself has had an impact because it’s a sanction”.The coming spending round has lent urgency to the drive for savings. Each department will be expected to outline its plans to cut costs, for example through sharing some services, as part of its funding bid to the Treasury.In the past, some departments resented the Cabinet Office’s interventions. Mr Crothers said: “There was a sense of ‘this is our patch, don’t invade’. Increasingly now they’re embracing the agenda, partly because they’ve seen it work and partly because politicians say: we need the savings.”
106;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Young more likely to switch banks;;Young people are distrustful, disengaged and disloyal towards their bank and are therefore more likely to switch between providers than older customers, according to research.Data from Accenture, the consultancy, found a dramatic increase in the number of customers who choose to access their bank account via mobile phone rather than visit a branch or speak to a representative by phone.Consultants say the findings suggest that the banking industry's success in launching low-cost digital channels may have come at the price of personal interaction and customer loyalty.Overall, bank customer trust in the UK fell last year, in spite of efforts by companies to improve customer relations. Out of 4,000 surveyed, 40 per cent said they considered their bank trustworthy, from 45 per cent in 2011.For younger customers the results were starker: less than a third of customers aged 18 to 24 believed their bank was fair and transparent and less than a quarter thought their bank was ethical.Technology was creating an “arm’s length relationship” between banks and customers that was having an impact on trust and opportunities to sell products, said Peter Kirk, a managing director at Accenture.The number of customers who chose to buy a product or open an account fell from just over 12 per cent to 8.5 per cent in 2012 and customers were more likely to move at least one product from their existing provider.uSwitch, the price comparison site, said there was a significant increase in customers moving their bank account last year, often fuelled by dissatisfaction.”When the news broke last year about the big problems with RBS accounts last summer there was a 15 per cent uplift in traffic on our site from customers looking at current account switching,” said Michael Ossei, a spokesman.Industry experts expect switching to increase this year when new rules are put into place to reduce the time it takes to move accounts.Engaged consumers who actively look for the best deals are an opportunity, not necessarily a problem, said Stephen Whitehouse, retail and commercial banking partner at PwC.Young people “are engaging with banks in a different way”, he said. “We are seeing this across the world – in the UK, in China, in India.”Over the next five years as they started taking out mortgages, “there is big business to be won by the banks that can serve them in the right way”, Mr Whitehouse said. “Engaging via mobile technology – providing a tailored service – is key.”The UK’s banking industry has spent time and money improving its customer service provision following the payment protection insurance scandal in which millions of customers were found to have been mis-sold policies.Some banks, including Barclays and the Co-operative, have opted to end sales incentives for retail banking staff and reward staff for positive customer service instead.However, charities say that the industry’s efforts have not yet gone far enough. “We continue to see a range of problems,” said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. “Those banks which put profits ahead of customer service need to change if trust is to be restored in the financial sector.”Complaints made by banking customers rose to a record in the final six months of 2012 to more than 283,000, according to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
107;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Specialist hubs spring up around London;;High-tech business incubators are springing up away from London’s digital hotspots of Shoreditch and Clerkenwell as the capital’s entrepreneurial breeding grounds become increasingly specialised.Level 39, an incubator on the vertiginous 39th floor of One Canada Square in Canary Wharf, opened officially last week to small businesses that market technology services to banks and other financial institutions.The so-called “fintech” venture, led by Eric van der Kleij, former chief executive of the Tech City Investment Organisation, the government agency for London’s tech sector, will offer space for up to 350 people as well as mentoring advice and links with the City of London.Mr van der Kleij said that across the city incubators and accelerators, which nurture small businesses and start-ups by providing support and facilities, were sharpening their focus. “You’re starting to see different areas offering thematic specialisation.”The traditional office space has been remodelled in the edgy post-industrial aesthetic popular with the tech crowd, with designers Gensler ripping out ceiling tiles to expose air vents and ducts. As well as hotdesks, an events room and Skype rooms for long-distance meetings, four so-called “sandbox” areas are available for testing products such as trading platforms in a secure IT environment.First in the building is the advisory group Accenture’s FinTech Innovation Lab London. Its seven start-ups will act as “beta testers”, ironing out any problems in the facility’s design and technology. They include BehavioSec, a security company that helps confirm individuals’ identities by analysing their keystrokes, clicks or swipes on computers or mobiles.Keiron Broadbent, spokesman for UKBI, a professional body for business incubators, said the more sector-specific approach had come about partly because of the demise of the regional development agencies, which had funded broad-based incubators for “job creation and addressing local market failures”, he said.“In London, the incubators that are springing up seem to have more private sector support, Google being a good example. And the private sector tends to have very defined objectives about what it wants to achieve,” Mr Broadbent said.Bioscience has established itself as a niche among the capital’s incubators. The London Bioscience Innovation Centre, set up in 2001, houses 40 biotech companies near St Pancras. Queen Mary BioEnterprises Innovation Centre, which opened in Whitechapel in 2011, has chemistry and biology laboratories on hand for its start-ups.Non-specialist incubators have based themselves largely in the former industrial zones of Shoreditch and Clerkenwell, which over the past decade have become hives of high-tech activity. The biggest and best-known, such as TechHub or the seven-floor Google Campus, are based in the area.But Hub Westminster, a social enterprise incubator co-founded by Westminster Council in 2011, uses its 12,000 sq ft floorspace a stone’s throw from Whitehall as a selling point for small businesses looking for access to government.Healthbox, which accelerates the development of health industry businesses, has seven ventures on the go in Hub Westminster’s Haymarket offices. Founded by US venture capital firm Sandbox Industries, Healthbox takes a stake in the businesses, providing £50,000 in seed capital and 12 weeks of support and mentoring. At the end of the process, it stages a pitching day where its companies present their businesses to 300-400 potential investors.Nina Desai, executive director of Healthbox, said their location worked well for health start-ups selling innovation at a time of far-reaching government reforms to the sector.“We’re next door to the National Health Service and the connection was perfect. We’re doing something different in the middle of the establishment,” she said.Westminster council wants to create a further 50,000 sq ft of incubator space over the next five years, and is planning a second business hub in the north of the borough. The location has yet to be announced, but likely spots include Paddington, Westbourne Park or Edgware Road.Indy Johar, executive director and co-founder of Hub Westminster, said incubators created a buzz that attracted not only entrepreneurs but designers, technical specialists and investors. “We’re not selling space but access to a community,” he said.Flipping burgers on a street corner is generally regarded as an inauspicious start for an empire-building entrepreneur, writes James Pickford. But for Cynthia Shanmugalingam, London’s street-side food stalls are the restaurant chains of the future.Ms Shanmugalingam, a former Treasury economist, last year founded Kitchenette, the UK’s first street food incubator, as a way for start-ups to capitalise on the city’s vibrant market scene.Food stalls allow budding restaurateurs to experiment with ideas without the need to rent costly premises or take on waitering staff, she says. “It’s a great way to test what you’re doing. You can learn but you can also gauge the market.”Based in Waterhouse, a not-for-profit restaurant in Shoreditch, Kitchenette has taken on eight aspiring food entrepreneurs in its first 12-week programme, which began in January. A second will start in September.The first tranche consists of an eclectic mix of businesses. Panouzzo was dreamt up by two brothers to sell toasted sandwiches directly from a truck fitted with an authentic wood-fired oven. Another is The Good Egg, which offers time-poor Londoners poached eggs sprinkled with chorizo or other toppings as they rush to work. And Kimchinary is bringing to London the latest street food trend to hit Los Angeles: Korean tacos.Kitchenette takes a 5 to 10 per cent equity stake in the businesses in return for expert mentoring advice, pitches at some of London’s top food markets, low-cost kitchen preparation facilities and introductions to investors.Does London need such a niche incubator? Ms Shanmugalingam thinks specialisation greatly improves the chances of success. “The conversation [among entrepreneurs] gets a lot richer when you’re talking about the same issues,” she says.Kitchenette has been designed as a social enterprise, pledging to donate 20 per cent of its profits to a charitable arm which focuses on entrepreneurs from low-income and minority ethnic backgrounds, and women entrepreneurs.This partly explains why it has secured pro bono mentoring commitments from seasoned entrepreneurs such as Sinclair Beecham, founder of Pret a Manger, and Dan Germain, Innocent Drinks creative director.“The food industry is a very tough business but at the same time it’s full of people who are willing to help each other,” says Ms Shanmugalingam.
108;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-03-18T16:52:56Z;The hunt for analytics talent hots up;The commercial potential of big data is clear, but there is a shortage of specialists with the skills to exploit it;The 21st century’s sexiest job is the data scientist, Harvard Business Review claimed recently. Such employees are “a hybrid of data hacker, analyst, communicator and trusted adviser”, the US business school journal said, pointing out that this combination of skills is extremely rare.Therein lies the problem for many businesses across the globe. While company managers recognise the benefits that big data can bring, they are struggling to find people with the right skills.The rush to make use of big data shows no sign of slowing. A survey of 600 companies in the US and UK conducted last year by Accenture, the management consultancy, found that two-thirds had appointed a senior figure to lead data management and analytics in the past 18 months. Even among companies that had not made such an executive appointment, 71 per cent expected to do so in the near future.Recruitment consultants also report soaring demand for data analytics specialists. Cititec, which specialises in the information technology sector and has offices in London and Amsterdam, says: “In the first six weeks of this year we received as many big data requests as we did for the previous six months. We reckon it will be up 100 per cent on last year, if not more.”Indeed, big data is fast becoming a crucial specialism for IT recruitment agencies. “We now have a big data specialist – we didn’t have one a year ago,” Cititec adds. “It’s a competitive market, with many companies vying for experienced talent.”Brian McCarthy, executive director of Accenture’s financial services analytics practice in North America, says global demand across the industry means there is a massive shortage of data analytics skills, especially in the US and the UK.“Graduates with the right kinds of backgrounds for data scientist – computer science, statistics, machine learning – are coming out of the universities, but they are not coming out in sufficient numbers,” he says.Mr McCarthy adds that although many companies are turning to contractors – nearly six out of 10 companies report turning to external analysts and consultants, according to Accenture – they are still unable to find the people they need.The shortfall is such that IT contractors who are experienced data architects or business analysts can command between £500 and £650 a day in the UK, says Cititec. At the most highly qualified end of the profession, PhD-level data scientists have attracted salaries of £95,000.“[The solution to the problem] is not even offshoring,” Mr McCarthy points out, “because there aren’t enough experienced people in emerging economies like Indian, China and Brazil.”And the squeeze looks set to continue for a few years.An Accenture report, Analytics in Action: Breakthroughs and Barriers on the Journey to ROI [return on investment], published this year, forecast that in the US and the UK alone, jobs demanding advanced knowledge in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) would grow five times as fast as jobs in other occupations by 2018, and four times faster than jobs in information-intensive industries such as financial services.Emerging economies are producing STEM talent in greater numbers than developing economies, the report said, but it is not enough to meet likely demand across the globe.Indeed, a survey conducted last year by Accenture’s Institute for High Performance looked at demand for analytics experience in the US, China, India, the UK, Japan Brazil and Singapore. It found that by 2015, with the exception of China, all of these countries would be facing a net shortage of PhD graduates qualified for analytics scientist jobs.“The US, the UK, Japan, Singapore and Brazil will almost certainly experience significant shortages of this top tier of talent,” Accenture said. “India, with its booming analytics services industry, will also struggle to produce enough new PhDs to fill all the new analytics scientist jobs.”The US, for example, is expected to create 44 per cent of the new jobs for analytics experts but only 23 per cent of the supply, leading to a shortfall of nearly 32,000 workers.Only China looks like showing a modest surplus, although Accenture cautioned: “Shortages are also possible in China if demand for analytics accelerates.”Nevertheless, there is plenty of training available for IT professionals who want to acquire data analytics skills. Courses – both online and class-based – are offered by large IT vendors such as IBM and Oracle, as well as by independent IT training specialists.Training is also offered by big data entrepreneurs. Cloudera, the provider of software and services based on the Hadoop framework, has its Cloudera University, for example, while competitor MapR has its MapR Academy.Cititec says: “A decent data analyst should have the requisite skills to move into analytics, perhaps learning or receive training on the job. IT professionals are beginning to be aware that the big data sector is becoming important, and they are asking, how do I get these skills?”However, Mr McCarthy at Accenture believes retraining IT specialists for the new world of data analytics is rarely as simple as putting existing staff on a course.“On-the-job training is helping to address the shortage of experienced people to a certain extent,” he says.“The challenge is that it’s not just a matter of learning new tools – there is also mindset shift required… That’s proving even more challenging for IT organisations, especially if they have people who grew up with the technology of the 1990s and the 2000s. In many cases, it’s easier to bring in new people than to attempt to retrofit an existing workforce.”
109;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
110;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-03-05T17:27:28Z;‘Big iron’ enterprise IT still has a role;;"It is relatively unusual to hear the word ‘mainframe’, or ‘ERP’ (enterprise resource planning) uttered in these days of smartphones, tablets and bring-your-own-devices.Like the PC, Windows XT and spreadsheets, mainframes and ERP systems may be out of fashion, but the reality is that large enterprise IT systems have long been the backbone of global companies and government agencies around the world.Typically they still run critical operations such as manufacturing, finance, materials planning, warehousing, human resources, sales, procurement, analytics and customer service, and without them business and commerce would grind to a halt.But now with the advent of cloud, software-as-a-service and related solutions that offer increasingly attractive options from a cost and flexibility perspective, some are asking whether we are approaching a time when it will be a case of ERP, RIP?“Not anytime soon,” says by Mark Willford of Accenture; he believes that enterprise IT systems will continue to play a critical role both by making business processes more consistent and tailored to a company’s unique needs, and ensuring more effective data security and integrity.“This is not to say, however, that ERP systems have not and will not continue to evolve over time,” says Mr Willford. “A ‘hybrid model’ – with ERP at the core and cloud-based innovation and on-demand services at the edge – promises organisations the best of both worlds.”Many companies, he says, will continue to pursue some form of ERP system implementation, while upgrading that system and adapting it to their needs, for three reasons:First, a universal operating model.To serve customers effectively, run back-office functions efficiently and manage the business consistently, a company needs to have all parts of its disparate, global organisation on a what Mr Willford calls a “universal operating model”.“This means operating on the same cost structure, for example, or recording profit and loss in the same way. With a consistent operating model, companies can support business growth faster and more predictably. Ultimately, having enterprise systems, with the same data fields, metrics and reporting mechanisms in place, will help remove the uncertainty that often occurs during acquisition.”Second, simplification.As companies and other organisations seek to standardise their operating models, they typically also try to simplify their IT environment, especially their suite of enterprise applications. “This allows for the delivery of significant cost reductions because the business operates more efficiently with a ‘single version of the truth,’ giving the company consistent, timely information from all its applications,” he says.“A major simplification and standardisation program focused on a company’s global operations can improve operating efficiency and customer service by accessing a common base of information, reporting and analytics to support better planning, management and decision making.”Third, security, integration and data managementManaging data – the lifeblood of any organisation – is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge. Cloud and software-as-a-service offerings, if not properly integrated, could potentially lead to a more chaotic, less reliable and less secure data environment. “While companies may be comfortable with a limited set of customer data in the cloud, will they have concerns about also including financial or credit information? How will they deal with issues regarding compliance?,” asks Mr Willford. “For these reasons, on-premise ERP systems remain a viable, continuing part of the IT equation.”In fact, he argues that a hybrid model that allows an organisation to take advantage of the benefits offered by new IT models such as cloud computing and SaaS in terms of cost and flexibility, while preserving those of the traditional enterprise systems, may provide an ideal solution.He cites the example of a mobile technology provider that is effectively combining its global ERP system with local systems in various geographies that support specific jurisdictional and country requirements after reaching the decision that it would be too expensive and take too long to extend its full ERP system into these locations.The company managed to achieve a balance between global consistency and local relevance by using a rapidly deployed and cost efficient local system for business management and financial consolidation, and then ensuring the integration of this data with its existing ERP system backbone.“This ‘two-tier’ ERP implementation offers the organisation closer control and governance by enabling the interoperability, while still giving different geographies and parts of the business the cost-effective flexibility needed to achieve their urgent goals,” he says. “This includes having cloud providers offer pay-as-you-go access to ERP functionality.”Nevertheless he acknowledges that “holding everything together becomes more complicated and exacting with the hybrid model.” Where traditionally the chief information officer was in charge, this new, hybrid IT environment presents a far more daunting challenge. A business may have a core ERP running simultaneously with a variety of cloud environments or services managed by both external vendors, including the ERP provider, and internally, along with a sprinkling of other legacy systems.“Managing the end-to-end performance of this far-flung IT environment, with its complex array of moving parts, may be beyond the capacity of both the company using IT services and its service providers,” he says.As a result, more companies are using a third party ‘system integrator’. Integrators typically work either in a consulting capacity, helping the client create a managed umbrella over broader ERP and local on-demand systems, or as a managed services provider that assumes responsibility for overseeing both the internal and external computing platforms. This includes taking on the associated risks and offering end-to-end service management capabilities.Another change has been the move towards what Mr Willford calls ‘industry accelerators’ for hybrid ERP/cloud IT systems. This involves identifying best practices within a particular industry, and then using them to speed up the rollout of an ERP system and the other SaaS or cloud services.For example, as one of the world’s largest gold mining companies grew, it found that its existing business processes, systems and data had become fragmented and outdated. To overcome these issues, the company implemented a new IT system using leading industry practices and specific natural resources system templates as a guide. As a result, the company’s systems were more efficient, it had greater visibility into its operations and its executives had the data they needed to design their business strategy and improve operational decisions.“On-premise ERP systems will continue to play a vital role in the future even as the large IT environment grows more modular and incorporates local varieties of business functions into the core system,” says Accenture’s Mr Willford. “Effective integration and management will remain the most important keys to success, and the challenge will be to put all the links together in such a way that the solution is both strong and flexible.”Mark Willford is the managing director in charge of technology ecosystems & offerings team at Accenture"
111;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-03-04T16:19:21Z;The value of collaboration and strength in numbers;;"There is an old saying in Moldova; When an individual does something alone there is slight strength, but where there are more than one – the strength increases.One of the things I have realised during my 17 months at Brandeis International Business School (IBS) is the importance of collaboration in all aspects of life; be it in your personal life, in school, or in a place of business.For the past few decades companies have begun to emphasise the value of collaboration and working together. “Must be a team player”, “Must work effectively in a group environment,” “Must play well with others” – these are all phrases which have become commonplace in job postings. (Okay, maybe not that last one.) This is further evidence that the ability to work productively as part of a team is a valued skill.High-performing companies strongly believe in the need for leading as a team. In a survey I worked on at Accenture, more than 90 per cent of respondents (a total of 192 geographically diverse executives) agreed that future leaders who lead collectively will be more effective than today’s leaders.According to the report, ‘Leadership Ensembles: Orchestrating the Global Company’, “As global business leaders seek to oversee and manage their large complex organisations, the paradigm for effective leadership is changing. Companies can no longer rely on single individuals at the top to handle the complexity and uncertainty of the global environment.”An example in mind is my current experience working with Brandeis IBS’ Real Estate club for the MIT Case Competition. The competition mimics the professional circumstances and assignments that graduates are likely to encounter when working in the real estate business. With only an information pack about a development site in hand, we had fewer than five days to submit a concept narrative, a PowerPoint presentation and a final “bid price”.Four of us worked on the project. We spent hours on our research to come up with the right assumptions to be used for our financial forecast. During our nightly meetings in an empty classroom at Brandeis, one of us would put the Excel file on the big screen and the team would stare up at the numbers on the screen for minutes at a time in silence. One person would point out that our estimations were too aggressive; others would argue that we had missed an important point.The team was in constant contact with each other – suggestions, re-evaluations and new concepts were volleyed back and forth like tennis balls at Wimbledon. In the end, the work we produced with effective teamwork and collaboration was far more impressive than anything we could have achieved individually.I believe my team’s example is a testimony as to why companies highly value individuals’ ability to co-operate and collaborate and the reason why at Brandeis IBS we are encouraged to work in groups and collaborate on homework, projects and other endeavours.In the words of Henry Ford: “Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success”."

Not only do they have to compete with top-notch global talent for a coveted MBA admit, but also with numerous eligible and deserving Indian applicants.This was the case for me when I started thinking of applying to top global business schools - the competition was huge. And I was unsure where to start.At that time one of my friends, an MBA graduate working at Accenture, advised me to do extensive research on MBA programmes and dig deeper into programme rankings, associated tuition costs, recruiting statistics, average GMAT scores and the percentage of international students. This would allow me to come up with a shortlist of MBA programmes where I would have a decent probability of getting an admit. He also had a word of caution: “Don’t get confused with the numerous online rankings because everyone follows a different criterion for rankings. But this research process will give you a fair idea of the information you want to seek.”I was pretty clear about pursuing a full time MBA but not too sure about pursuing a one-year or a two-year MBA programme. So I started with my online research and first of all compiled a list of 20 preferred schools using three popular online rankings, including the Financial Times MBA rankings. The initial list helped me acquire a good understanding of the programmes, both one-year and two-year MBAs and I was able to come up with a second shortlist of my target schools (around 10) much more easily. In my shortlist, I tried to keep a mix of schools offering one-year and two-year MBA programmes, such as Ross, Duke, IIMs, Insead and ISB. This allowed me to focus better on applying to schools where I knew I would stand a good chance.From my perspective, rankings may not be the ultimate answer as to which school is the best fit for an MBA aspirant, but they are an indispensable tool to determining where one has the best chance. So my advice to MBA aspirants would be to understand the methodology behind the rankings, analyse popular rankings, come up with a shortlist, do school specific research, figure out where to apply and prepare accordingly. Then give it your best shot.
113;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-01-16T17:12:21Z;Accenture named most gay-friendly employer;;The management consultancy Accenture topped the new 2013 list of Britain’s 100 most gay-friendly employers, compiled by the charity Stonewall.The company was praised for its lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender network, led by a board member, with more than 200 participants, and for its diversity training.Accenture was followed by Gentoo, a housing association, and the Co-operative group – the first retailer to make it into the top 10 ranking of employers.Last year’s winners, Ernst & Young, slipped to fourth place in the Workplace Equality Index, while the Home Office, which came second last year, fell to fifth.The index is compiled after asking entrants 25 questions about their policies, such as whether they allow partners of employees the same benefits – whether gay or straight – and anonymous staff feedback surveys.A Stonewall spokesman said there had been a “dramatic shift” in British employers’ attitudes towards gay people in the past 10 years, since the law was changed to prevent workers from being dismissed because of their sexuality.“We’ve gone from ‘able to be sacked because you were gay’ to an index which celebrates achievement of employers,” he said.But he added that some sectors, such as the media and sport, were still slow to embrace “gay-friendly” policies.The public sector – from government departments to local emergency services – features widely in the list, while multinational companies winning praise include Barclays, Goldman Sachs and IBM.Stonewall has been compiling the list since 2005, when six of the employers in the top 100 requested anonymity – not wanting their names to appear on the index.
114;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-01-15T17:53:55Z;Misery loves company;Using social media to track outbreaks of disease can provide valuable public health information;Graham Dodge has reason to be grateful for catching a stomach bug. It was while he was laid low with the virus that he came up with the idea for Sickweather, a website that uses social media to track the spread of disease.“I went on Facebook to see who among my friends had the same thing,” says the US computer designer and entrepreneur. “That’s when I realised that this basic need to connect and see who else was sick could be done on a much larger scale, using Twitter and Facebook.”Sickweather, which Mr Dodge launched with James Sajor and Michael Belt in 2011, tracks the spread of diseases, producing something akin to a weather map for common ailments. It is part of a growing trend by scientists and health organisations to make use of the mass of information generated by social media.New York’s University of Rochester, for example, runs a project to monitor flu using Twitter, the microblogging site. And in a sign that perhaps political leaders are starting to take notice, the US Department of Homeland Security, has engaged Accenture, the management consultancy, to help it investigate how social media network data could be used to better inform and protect the public in the event of an infectious disease outbreak or a biological attack.Mr Dodge’s creation of Sickweather followed his experience launching an online crime map. He says Twitter is well suited to tracking diseases. Sickweather covers 27 health problems including cold, flu, stomach virus, chickenpox, eczema and insomnia.Academics, too, confirm that illness-related tweets from Twitter’s more than 500m users worldwide can be revealing. Researchers at the University of Iowa found that estimates of flu-like illness derived from Twitter accurately tracked reported disease levels during the pandemic of 2009. A study by the University of Bristol reported similar results in the UK.In a paper entitled You Are What You Tweet: Analyzing Twitter for Public Health, Michael Paul and Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, concluded that Twitter provides “quantitative correlations with public health data and qualitative evaluations of model output. Our results suggest that Twitter has broad applicability for public health research”.They added: “Twitter can have a greater impact on public health informatics than just influenza tracking . . . millions of users could provide new tools for public health research.”Internet users’ searches also offer a snapshot of disease trends. Google says results from its Flu Trends initiative closely match the data collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The search engine group runs a similar project to track dengue fever activity in Latin America and south Asia.Even though social media are a rich source of intelligence on the spread of disease, they are not yet a substitute for more conventional methods of gathering information. One issue, say experts, is the provenance of the data.“Evaluating data for epidemiology is not just about taking raw data,” says Ken Eames, a lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “The problem with social media information is that it is often anonymous, and you may not know so much about its source, so the value for epidemiology may be limited.”Mr Eames is involved in running Flusurvey.org, a website that tracks the spread of the illness throughout the UK. Rather than monitoring social media, Flusurvey relies on registered users to supply details about when and where they are sick. The project, now in its fourth year, has sister sites that cover the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France and Sweden, so data from all the countries can be compared.Mr Eames says: “The advantage of [an online system] is that it does not dependent on anyone going to hospital to report their infection, which is the way this sort of information has traditionally been collected. And we get a lot of very useful extra information, such as whether people went to see a doctor, whether they took time off work and whether they took medicines.”Nevertheless, Mr Eames is an advocate of using social media to gather health data. “The great amount of data available from Twitter is bound to be a great resource for tracking diseases,” he says. “Another value of something like Twitter is that it can get just about everywhere to gather data, and get an idea of people’s location.”At Sickweather, Mr Dodge believes there is plenty more that can be done with social media data to learn about disease. “We really want to open up to other languages, as right now we are only using English,” he says.He also believes social media could be harnessed to provide valuable insights into illnesses such as cancer.“We would like to see what social media can reveal that has not been revealed yet from other studies,” Mr Dodge says. “How environment impacts on chronic illness, for example, or other factors such as weather and travel. I think a lot could be learnt from comparing other data to the information we’ve gathered from social media.”

Customers include Tissot, the Swiss watchmaker, which lets customers see what a watch looks like on an image of their actual wrist.In the run-up to Christmas, ASOS, the online fashion retailer, launched a campaign by which users could watch a video advert and instantly buy what the models were wearing by clicking on moving images.“The biggest factor is consumer behaviour,” says Emi Gal, the head of Brainient, the company behind the campaign. “People haven’t been used to clicking on a video. But with the rise of touchscreens, people have started engaging with content even more.”However, “showrooming” – when shoppers try products on in the high street before buying them online for less – has become ever-more prevalent. Nearly two-thirds of Britons aged 20 to 40-years-old admit to doing this, according to a recent survey by Accenture. The advent of smartphones means users now do not even have to leave the shop in order to buy it elsewhere for less.
116;ACN;Accenture Plc;2013-01-07T17:19:43Z;Rethink required on graduate training;Recruitment and development of the best university students are crucial even in a downturn;"It’s 25 years, almost to the day, since I started at the Financial Times. “One tip,” confided a more experienced colleague, early on: “Don’t stay more than five years, or you’ll be here for ever.”The miracle, however, is not that I’m still here but that the graduate training programme is – alongside much larger versions operated by bigger companies, from Accenture to Zurich Insurance.Such programmes face many threats, however. Companies face accusations that they hire graduate trainees as cheap labour. But the opposite risk worries boardrooms more: that such programmes are a costly investment in all-too-mobile assets. According to one more recent FT trainee, his contemporaries in other schemes regard their apprenticeship with “utter cynicism”, as a way of gaining the imprimatur of, say, a Big Four accountancy firm, before moving on to something trendier. Those who do stay risk becoming the most insular followers of a restrictive management culture – a charge laid against the BBC in a recent review of the missteps that eventually triggered the departure of the broadcaster’s director-general George Entwistle, himself a BBC lifer and former graduate trainee.When companies are shedding experienced employees, some chief executives may feel it is perverse to go on sucking in ingénues, who think they know everything but in fact can’t locate the stationery cupboard, let alone the corporate strategy. Demand for jobs far exceeds supply and popular employers can use technological tools to attract and screen the best candidates, including proven experts. So why bother applying the cumbersome filter of an official scheme and wasting time and money on a formal training process for novices?The continuity of some schemes has indeed fluctuated through the financial crisis. In 2009, in the middle of a redundancy programme, UK telecoms company BT suspended some of its campus recruitment to concentrate instead on redeployment of trained staff to the few vacancies available. Goldman Sachs won’t run a formal two-year programme for would-be analysts in investment banking and investment management from this year; it has opted instead to employ college graduates full time on permanent contracts. (The FT took a break from its scheme in 2012, having hired more graduates than usual in previous years, and restarts this year.)But graduate recruitment and training should be a priority, even in a downturn. It may be unfeasible to expect career-long loyalty from the latest intake, but employers’ investment in graduates will be repaid later. A few may go on to lead the company – as the current chief executives of Munich Re and Barclays have, among others. The rest, even if they leave, could form a diaspora of sympathetic customers and suppliers. There is a reason big graduate recruiters such as Procter & Gamble and McKinsey cultivate alumni networks.Meanwhile, what looks like inexperience should be read as fresh thinking. Younger staff may hold the key to technological change and innovation. Phil Clarke, chief executive of Tesco (and another former trainee), has a 25-year-old staff member in his office, to provide him with a youthful perspective.It is, however, no longer realistic to expect these advantages to spring from traditional programmes of general management training – what Gordon Chesterman, director of Cambridge university’s career service calls “Cook’s tours” of different departments. In line with the more specialised nature of business, companies are seeking out recruits with affinity for specialist areas and tailoring programmes to attract promising candidates who have, in Mr Chesterman’s words, been “learning about logistics from the age of 12”. Universities also find companies are fishing for younger candidates, hooking students who have proved themselves on company internships before their final year.One further element is essential. Companies that wish to attract and retain skilled staff must now apply the same flexible thinking and close attention they focus on recent graduates to employees entering the last quarter-century of their careers. I’ll be surprised if I’m still working here in my 70s, despite my colleague’s 1988 forecast. But I’ll almost certainly be working somewhere and I hope some future employer will be as committed to training me in my 50s and 60s – and I as committed to being trained – as the FT was when I joined it, aged 23.andrew.hill@ft.com"
117;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-11-19T11:54:37Z;The importance of understanding culture;;People often say that learning is more than just reading from a book, but I never truly understood what this meant until I was in Turkey this summer with my fellow business school classmates.I was there as part of an immersion programme and for an entire week we visited companies, factories, financial institutions, universities and government agencies. As a class, we discussed Turkey’s economy and the private sector and got some interesting insider knowledge about the companies we visited.For my summer internship at Accenture, I worked on a project that investigated multiple characteristics of successful business approaches. One of the most important factors turned out to be cultural awareness and cultural intelligence. Companies such as InBev, Scotiabank and MetLife have all launched global talent mobility programmes to train students and employees in global awareness and culturally conscious practices.During my trip to Turkey, I experienced at first hand how important cultural competence is in the business world. Turkish business culture is unlike many others. Although there is an increasing trend towards western corporate culture in some of the larger companies, many businesses are still family-owned and run.Most of the companies we visited – Koç Holding, Arçelik A.Ş, Dudullu Industrial Zone Project – are family-owned enterprises where employees are treated with high respect and consideration. In these companies, Turks prefer doing business with those they like, trust, feel comfortable with and with people with whom they feel can provide a productive long-term relationship.Many companies fail because they don’t have a complete perception of what is really going on in the country they are going to do business with. One example is Caesars Entertainment (formerly known as Harrah’s Entertainment). During a class session last spring, the company’s chief executive Gary Loveman confessed that Caesars missed out on a great business opportunity in Macau because the American businessmen couldn’t understand the business culture of China.I think we, as students, learn the most by travelling to countries that are, in a sense, still “working out the kinks,” whether that means trying to establish a stable capitalist structure or trying to gain a greater share in the international market.In studying the business dynamics in places such as Turkey, we can see that the success of companies does not depend on finance and accounting alone, but to a greater degree on their cultural sensitivity and global awareness. These are indicators that cannot be measured and are not found in text books.
118;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Sayonara to the corporate life;;Takuma Iwasa had no qualms about leaving his job at Panasonic and setting up a consumer electronics company of his own, even though Japan’s once dominant manufacturers in the sector were starting to struggle.“I was not worried at all,” says 34-year-old Mr Iwasa, who left Japan’s largest consumer electronics maker in 2007 to set up Cerevo, which stands for consumer electronics revolution, in Tokyo.“I am the kind of person who needs to do something enjoyable and challenging, to make something out of nothing,” he says. With his mop of longish hair and trendy glasses, and surrounded in a corner of his office by a tangle of cables and boxes of electronics products, he is the very picture of an entrepreneur.Mr Iwasa is representative of a small but growing band of young Japanese entrepreneurs who forgo the promise of a monthly pay cheque and the social standing bestowed by a big-name employer for the excitement and satisfaction of doing what they really want to do.Such individuality and self-confidence have been rare in Japanese society, which has traditionally valued teamwork and conformity.In his dark suit and slick tie, Naoki Endo could be mistaken for someone in the fashion industry. The 38-year-old says he did not know what he wanted to do when he left his consulting job at what was then Andersen Consulting in 2000.“I wanted to do something that I could be passionate about,” he says.That turned out to be beBit, a company that designs websites based on behavioural analysis, which he started in 2003.Keita Yagi, who left Fujifilm to start BSize, in Odawara, halfway between Tokyo and Mount Fuji, has a mission to bring out well-designed yet functional consumer electronics products. While still in high school, the softly spoken Mr Yagi was inspired by what Steve Jobs was doing at Apple.Mr Yagi, now 29, decided he wanted to start his own company because “I wanted to make things that were beautiful and would also change the world”. He made his first pro­duct batch in the back room of his home.Recent changes in Japan have made the country a more welcoming environment for young entrepreneurs● The threat of redundancy and cost-cutting has made employment at large corporations less appealing.● Following the tsunami there has been greater emphasis on doing good for society rather than seeking profits.● The government is providing low-interest loans and loan guarantees to small businesses.● The internet has lowered the costs of starting a small business, allowing start-ups to market and sell their goods without the need for expensive advertising contracts.For Japan’s new breed of entrepreneurs, the personal satisfaction they derive from doing what they want is increasingly more important than the security of a job at a well-known company.For some, in fact, working for a big company seems riskier than running their own business, since large Japanese companies train employees to be generalists who often have few skills to offer outside their immediate employment.“Working for a big company may provide security in the short term but if the company goes bust you won’t have anything to fall back on. So there is greater security in developing the skills that will make you useful to any company, anywhere, at any time”, Mr Endo says.Mr Iwasa had not planned to start his own business when he joined Panasonic. But when, inspired by the emergence of YouTube, he suggested his company develop a television that linked to the internet, his boss told him it was too early. It made him realise, he says, that while Panasonic was skilled at improving on existing technologies, it was not good at developing entirely new “genres” of product, which is what he wanted to do.At Cerevo, where he heads a team of about 10 people, he has developed internet devices such as Live Shell, which enables users to live-stream video from their camcorders directly on to the web without using a PC.Mr Iwasa has so far raised Y370m ($4.6m) from two rounds of venture capital funding. Japanese funds, including Inova, Kronos Fund, Inspire and Neostella Capital, have been his key investors.Continuous cost-cutting and re­structuring at big corporations have also made young Japanese more willing to set out on their own.Mr Yagi will be joined next year by a high-school classmate who currently works at Panasonic: “He says it is no fun any more because he is constantly told to cut costs.”After decades of wealth, people are less interested in materialistic things and have a greater desire to contribute to the wellbeing of society, says Mariko Tamura, secretary-general of the Japan Academic Society for Ventures and Entrepreneurs, a research association supporting the advancement of venture businesses.The trend became pronounced after the tsunami last year, which brought home the importance of relationships and community solidarity. “There is definitely an increase in young people who want to contribute to society,” Ms Tamura says.“People should work to make the world better. I feel very strongly that putting profits first destroys the world,” says Mr Endo.He says that the world’s great entrepreneurs, from Henry Ford to Konosuke Matsushita, founder of Panasonic, followed this view. “People who set up a company just for fun will give up easily but those who have a goal to create a better society will not,” he says.Mr Yagi says he turned down investment from venture capitalists so as not to compromise his commitment to doing social good. “I want to contribute to society, so if someone tells me I have to put profits first, it would go against my philosophy,” he says.Nevertheless, beBit has grown into a business with 78 full-time staff and more than 20 part-time workers. The company, whose customers include Sumitomo Mitsui bank, Honda and Nestlé, has capital of more than Y1bn and has opened its first overseas office in Taiwan.Until recently, Japan was not an easy place for start-ups, because of a risk-averse financial sector and a culture that did not look kindly on failure. However, the government has be­come more supportive of start-ups, providing low-interest loans and loan guarantees. Mr Yagi set up Bsize with Y20m in funds from a government-affiliated financial institution.But the biggest change is the spread of the internet and online services, which have lowered the barriers to doing business for small companies with limited funds.Mr Iwasa notes that free access to online information and services, such as free calls on Skype and free marketing through Facebook, have made it far easier to start a business.For example, by using social media it is possible for small companies to market their products without having to pay expensive advertisers.“Facebook is really effective as a marketing tool because it spreads the word about a product globally and very rapidly,” agrees Mr Yagi, who only sells his products online.“It used to be very difficult to build a brand but now, with the help of social media, we can compete even against big, established brands.”
119;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Systems management: Institutions try to find cloud’s silver lining;Paul Taylor finds a growing demand for external hosting;Cloud computing – the common term for a company hosting computer resources, such as email storage, on external servers instead of on servers in its own premises – may bring profound changes to the banking and financial services sector.“Cloud computing will increasingly provide banks with new lower cost operating models thanks to virtualisation, greater automation, and the ability to push more activities offshore,” Accenture, the IT consultancy, said in a report this year.“As these benefits are realised, banks will face decisions regarding the business case for moving legacy systems [such as data on existing internal servers] into the cloud or building cloud-enabled assets that they will then integrate into the legacy environment.“Banks are already moving very aggressively to cloud and software as a service consumption models [in which programs are hosted in the cloud] for almost everything, usually supporting processes that are not mission critical and don’t need to be managed within their own environment, things like human resources and procurement,” says Don Trotta, global head of banking industry development at SAP, the software group.“This allows them to reduce internal costs and complexity.”But many are moving cautiously, in part because data privacy and security regulations in many countries prohibit storage and processing of customer data outside national borders. Banks are also understandably wary of the potentially disastrous impact of a serious breach of security or privacy, or of even a brief failure in areas such as ATM operations, fraud monitoring or credit card processing.“Many banks, therefore, take the view that they should keep their core banking processes under complete control in their own data centre so they know where the data [are] at all times,” said the Accenture report.Such caution is reflected in comments by Tom Durkin, global head of integrated channels for Bank of America. “Cloud computing is certainly something we are evaluating,” he says.But he adds: “There’s a lot of focus on the security that goes with it. Obviously we’re talking more about private cloud type infrastructure [which limits access and is protected by a security firewall] than public, but there’s also lots of internal education to be done to get your risk and your compliance folks educated on what this means.”But some newer banks have incorporated so-called multi-tenant cloud-based systems (under which software is provided for the use of many clients rather than for the use of an individual customer) into their core banking activities. Examples include the UK’s Metro Bank and Sofol Tepeyac in Mexico.Some US banks, including Atlanta-based SunTrust, are using the Varolii pay-as-you-go cloud-based voice dialler to call customers to remind them to make payments and prompt them to do so.SunTrust says it has reduced the number of inbound calls to its call-centre, saved between $8 and $25 per call, and cut first payment defaults by more than 60 per cent.Accenture adds that private cloud models are playing an increasingly pivotal role in core banking activities.One example is Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank, which touts the advantages of using cloudlike technologies to help steer the company through a three-year integration project following the $15bn acquisition of Wachovia, the financial services company. “We think the cloud is here to stay, but not a public cloud,” says Scott Dillon, executive vice-president.Wells Fargo began by “virtualising” its servers – running software that enables multiple applications to run on the same server and still be managed as though each has its own dedicated server.The advantages of this are much greater flexibility – you can add a virtual server for a new application almost instantly – and much more efficient use of the physical hardware. For example, 80 per cent usage of a server’s capacity instead of 15 per cent.Additionally, by moving to standardised software – programs used by everyone – it effectively made a private cloud inside its own firewalls. This enabled the bank to reduce its number of data centres dramatically, cut the number of applications it was running by 25 per cent to 3,000 and decreased the time needed for starting up a new application server from months to 10 days.By the end of last year, almost two-thirds of the bank’s servers were virtualised and 80 per cent standardised.As a result, Wells Fargo achieved $1bn in savings with a significant portion attributed to its infrastructure efficiency effort.“Because private clouds are not exposed to external ‘tenants’, banks tend to regard them as a more secure environment for customer data,” notes Accenture, although the firm adds that, “in many cases, the security mechanisms put in place by global public cloud providers may actually be stronger than those in many banks’ internal systems”.Over time, Accenture thinks that most banks are likely to follow a hybrid cloud strategy, which may also include a cloud owned by and located in the bank but operated by a third-party.
120;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Infosys earnings disappoint investors;;"Shares in Infosys fell by more than 5 per cent following a second-quarter earnings report that disappointed investors and dented hopes of a turnround in the fortunes of India’s second-largest IT developer by revenue.The Bangalore-based group remains one of the country’s most celebrated software companies, but has produced some lacklustre figures against a backdrop of economic weakness in its major European and North American export markets.In September Infosys dipped into its nearly $4bn of cash reserves to buy Lodestone, a Swiss management consulting group, in a $350m deal, raising hopes of further acquisitions to bolster growth and expectations that management would increase its full-year revenue guidance.But while the company announced a 24 per cent rise in net profits to $440m compared with the same period last year, the performance was overshadowed by declining margins and continued conservative earnings forecasts.The group confirmed that full-year revenue was likely to be $7.3bn, a figure that did not include revenue from its recent Swiss purchase, but which represents an increase of only around 5 per cent in an industry projected to grow roughly twice as quickly over the same period.S D Shibulal, chief executive at Infosys, said: “Global economic uncertainties continue to face the industry . . . We have increased employee wages, used some of our cash in a transformational acquisition of a consulting business and enhanced our investment in R&D and solutions.”Mr Shibulal has faced criticism since taking over at Infosys last year for pitting his company against groups like Accenture and IBM by placing greater emphasis on high-end services and consulting at a time in which its struggling multinational clients are trying to reduce IT spending.Investors were also disappointed when the company blamed currency fluctuations for its decision to trim full-year earnings per share guidance, despite increasing revenue by around 22 per cent to $1.9bn compared with the same period last year.The weak performance suggests Infosys is likely to fall further behind Tata Consultancy Services, India’s leading software group by revenue, and led some analysts to question whether the group would be able to meet even its more moderate earnings targets for this financial year.“Frankly it’s a tough ask. Their performance over the last few quarters does not inspire confidence, and I think they will now miss their guidance”, says Kawaljeet Saluja, head of research at Kotak Institutional Equities, a Mumbai-based brokerage.Fears that deeper operational issue may lie behind the weak performance were heightened by the unexpected decision of V Balakrishnan, the group’s finance officer and a two-decade veteran at the group, to step down from his post.“The company is missing numbers quarter after quarter”, Mr Saluja says. “There clearly is some sort of execution issue going on internally, which is even more worrying.”BG Srinivas, head of the group’s European operations, played down the fears, saying: “We are going to be hit with headwinds in the next two to three quarters, but we are reasonably confident we should be able to meet the guidance . . . It is not a given; it is a task that we have work on. But there is no cause for panic.”Infosys shares were down 5.4 per cent at Rs2,395 in afternoon trading."
121;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-09-25T21:18:20Z;Networking sites: Pay attention to who is using social media;Weight of numbers – and the influence such services have – make it impossible to ignore them, says Stephen Pritchard;Facebook claimed 995m active users, as of June 2012. Twitter has about 500m users, and YouTube, owned by Google, says it has 800m visitors each month, watching 4bn hours of video. Renren, a Chinese social media site, claims 157m active accounts.For marketing purposes alone, social media sites – designed for consumers to stay in touch with friends, publish photographs or share information about hobbies and interests – are an attractive platform.And they are also economical: a standard Facebook page is free, even to the largest businesses.Companies are also finding that social media services can provide more than just an alternative to a static webpage. Social media, through services such as Twitter’s firehose – its full data feed – provide a rich source of information to companies about how their brands or products are perceived.Handled correctly, social media can serve a valuable customer services function, and also a way to create and follow groups of customers, suppliers or “influencers” who might be useful to the business.LinkedIn, which styles itself as a business social network, is also a useful recruiting tool.But it is the way in which social media services allow businesses to interact with their customers, and especially harder to reach groups such as young adults, that appeals to marketers.Mark McDonald, head of executive programmes research at Gartner, the research company, says: “The economy we are now in places a higher value on participation, and consumers want to connect with each other and demonstrate their knowledge. That changes their association with the product, or the brand.”Used in the right way, Mr McDonald says, social media can persuade customers to become unpaid advocates for a brand.And research shows that consumers trust and value recommendations on social media more than they do conventional advertising.At the same time, simply spending money on social media does not always deliver the right results.Ford, for example, has run successful social media campaigns around car launches such as the latest model Fiesta. Its rival General Motors, though, very publicly pulled advertising worth $10m from Facebook, saying they had not seen a sufficient return on their investment.Other smaller-scale projects sometimes work better. British Airways, for example, began its recent “Aviators” brand advertising campaign, not in the cinemas, but on Facebook. Sony’s broadcast division has also run a series of online chats for film-makers about its latest video cameras on the same site.One advantage of social media over conventional advertising is flexibility. However, Nathan Sage, a social intelligence expert at PA Consulting Group suggests that very flexibility can also be social media’s weakness.“You can spend quite a lot of time having a conversation about whether social media is internally or externally focused, whether it is PR or marketing or customer service.He adds: “There is a disconnect between brands and their understanding of what social is.”There have been faux pas, such as interns tweeting office gossip to thousands of followers, or companies seriously misjudging the mood of their customers.McLaren Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton is just one celebrity to have fallen foul of Twitter’s ease of use, for sharing a telemetry sheet showing data of car set-up information that could have been useful to rival teams.Businesses also have to pay more attention to who uses their social media tools, especially in regulated industries such as financial services or legal services.“We’ve used social media a lot,” says Paul Caris, chief information officer at Eversheds, the law firm. “We’ve used Twitter for some of our vertical specialisms, such as in our food practice, and our partners in those areas have created small but very active communities.“Obviously, Twitter is not a brilliant area for collaboration, as it is basically a broadcast medium. But we’ve introduced policies to ensure that the way we communicate over social media platforms is consistent and that we all understand that what you put on there is public facing.“And we do also take activity that starts on Twitter offline, either to LinkedIn, or to a private collaboration area, owned by Eversheds.”David Hodgkinson, an adviser on customer and channel management at KPMG, the professional services firm, agrees that even tightly controlled industries such as retail banking can use Twitter, if they do so with care.“It is a way of capturing customer dissatisfaction that might not be picked up through person-to-person contact,” Mr Hodgkinson says.PA Consulting’s Mr Sage says dealing with complaints has to be done correctly: social media users wield enormous collective power.“Organisations have to have the ability to deal with that. If they don’t react, it can damage the brand.”But there is a further, important element to how organisations use social media. Jason Breed, social media practice lead at Accenture, the management consultants, argues that although business-specific tools such as Yammer – which provides internal social networks – businesses will do themselves few favours if they cut staff off from consumer tools such as Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn.“Used correctly, social media will help companies to recruit and retain the best employees,” says Mr Breed. “For some time, that’s given the best companies an edge over those that ask candidates to fax a résumé. No cool kid at college wants to do that.”
122;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-09-17T11:30:16Z;Dipping my toes into strategy consulting;;"The hustle and bustle of the school year has started and it’s difficult to imagine that it was only a few weeks ago that I was enjoying my last moments of summer! Before I talk too much about the fall, I wanted to tell you a little bit about what I did this summer.I knew I wanted to get some hands-on business experience and I was grateful that I was able to get an internship position at Accenture, the global management consultant. During the summer I was working with the Accenture Institute for High Performance (AIHP), a “think-and-act tank” in Boston. It was a good example of the importance of networking – a professor at Brandeis IBS was teaching a class on global leadership and through my connection with him I was able to come on board!I did extensive research on executive leadership, combing through interviews and surveys the company conducted with approximately 200 HR executives all over the world. We tried to identify what it takes for leaders at the top to lead effectively and maximise their companies’ success.The answer? What we call a “leadership ensemble”- an alliance of top leaders who share three common elements: agility in organisation and decision-making, foresight, gained through disciplined efforts to bring both the future and the world “into the room,” and synthetic intelligence, captured through a combination of experience and analytics. It was exciting to present our findings with leadership thinkers during the 2012 annual meeting of the Academy of Management.Another project I was responsible for over the summer was a project that explores the whitespace of the “tri-sector” partnerships (unique situations when three different sectors – public, private and NGOs – converge). This space entails finding out the skills and attributes that leaders engaged in tri-sector partnerships need to be effective and how they can be trained to repeat that success on future projects.During my assignment I collaborated with colleagues from Accenture Development Partnership which is an example of cross-sectoral partnerships where consultants give away 50 per cent of their salary stake to work with public and non-profit organisations to address global challenges. Experts that have worked in such assignments emphasised that cross-sector partnerships are hybrid organisations, requiring a hybrid type of leadership. But the tricky questions are still the same – How important are the different leadership abilities of tri-sector leaders? Are certain skills more important in one sector than another?It is hard to over-emphasize the net result from this summer. I have realised what I want to do with my life; I knew I wanted to do management consulting, but now I know I want it to be specifically in strategy consulting. I’ll be taking classes this year with Brandeis IBS MBA director Ben Gomes-Casseres, whose research interests are in alliance strategy and competition.I’m curious to hear what other MBAs did during their summers. Did you get as much out of your work experiences as I did from mine? Feel free to post in the comments below."
123;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-09-10T20:59:51Z;‘High risk’ groups face outsourcing ban;;The performance of troubled Olympics contractor G4S will be reviewed “very carefully”, the Cabinet Office has warned, in a shake-up of outsourcing contracts across government that has already seen two IT companies struck off its list for future tenders.The department’s decision to look at G4S’s record comes as Nick Buckles, chief executive, is due to appear before the Commons’ home affairs committee on Tuesday to explain why the private contractor failed to provide a promised 10,400 venue guards for the Olympic Games.Fujitsu, the IT group whose contract was terminated in 2008 over a £900m deal to install electronic patient records across the south of England, has been deemed for the time being too “high risk” to take on new public sector deals along with another unnamed IT services contractor, according to people close to the situation. The Cabinet Office refused to confirm the identities of either of the companies that have in effect been blacklisted.Ahead of Mr Buckles’ appearance, Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, said he understood the public anxiety over G4S’s performance because of its status as a main supplier to government. It has contracts with the police, probation and welfare services, and runs six prisons.“When the dust has settled on the Olympics and Paralympics, we need to look with the Home Office very carefully at what the out-turn in performance was from G4S and take a view at that stage,” Mr Maude told the Financial Times.The latest initiative to ban companies with troubled histories in government from new contracts is being spearheaded by Bill Crothers, formerly of Accenture. He was appointed as chief procurement officer two months ago to inject private sector rigour into Whitehall’s contracting system. Mr Crothers said his new approach would allow past performance to be taken into account for the first time when a company is bidding for a fresh tender.Fujitsu, which is suing the Department of Health for £700m, confirmed it had received a letter from the Cabinet Office about its position as a “longstanding and important supplier”.Even before its Olympics fiasco, G4S, the world’s biggest security company by revenues, was in the spotlight over the growing role of the private sector in delivering public services – particularly after it won a £200m deal to staff and build Lincolnshire’s new police station and custody block.Keith Vaz, chair of the home affairs committee, said he welcomed the tough approach Cabinet Office ministers were taking over public sector contracting arrangements. “G4S admitted to the committee earlier this summer that they had presided over a humiliating shambles at the Olympics,” he said. “It’s important that we look at their record across the board when awarding new contracts.”G4S pointed to its positive record in prison management, the welfare-to-work programme, and on electronic monitoring of offenders but declined to respond to the Cabinet Office’s comments.Additional reporting by Gill Plimmer
124;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-08-26T13:49:03Z;CGI eyes further deals as IT consolidates;;The ink has barely dried on CGI’s £1.7bn deal to buy UK rival Logica, but already the Canadian IT services company acknowledges that it is ready to do more deals as the sector continues to consolidate.“In the end there will only be five or six companies in this sector and we are committed to be one of them,” Michael Roach, CGI chief executive, told the Financial Times. “We have something different here in terms of our management style and we can move rapidly and be opportunistic when we need to be. We are in this for the long term.”There are still hundreds of IT services companies in the market offering to help customers build and run their computer systems. Some of the largest include Accenture and CSC in the US as well as Capgemini in France.The purchase of Logica has catapulted previously low-profile CGI to the sixth largest by revenues of the pure IT service companies, which do not also sell software or computer equipment as part of their business. With 72,000 staff and pro-forma revenues of C$10.4 bn (£6.6bn), CGI will be of a similar size to France’s Atos.Before it pursues further ambitions, however, CGI must grapple with the tough task of integrating Logica, a company still reeling from a series of profits warnings and redundancies announced late last year. Logica has revenue of just less than £4bn, nearly 50 per cent more than CGI, but its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margins are just 6 to 7 per cent compared with 14.5 per cent at its new Canadian owner.Created out of a series of Europe-wide acquisitions by former chief executive Martin Read, Logica’s different business units were never fully knitted together. Staff complain about lack of management structure and some of the most skilled people have drifted away over the last few years of financial difficulty.Mr Roach believes, however, that Logica employees can be energised by CGI’s democratic management style. More than 85 per cent of staff are shareholders in the company.“No one ever washes a rental car,” Mr Roach says to crystalise the concept - in other words, “owners always take better care of a business”. By encouraging employees to take a financial stake in the business, he says he gets them to work harder and empowers them to challenge management and act quickly on opportunities.Logica staff will be offered the opportunity to buy stakes in CGI on the same terms as CGI staff, with the company matching every share they purchase.“It’s buy-one-get-one-free, or essentially a 50 per cent discount. We have seen real interest from Logica employees in this,” Mr Roach said. For CGI employees – who Mr Roach prefers to call “members” to reflect their ownership of the business – the share scheme has been a good deal so far, with the share price up some 6000 per cent from the level the company listed at 15 years ago.There will, Mr Roach admits, be redundancies as a result of putting the two companies together. These are to be announced within a matter of weeks, but CGI has not yet indicated how many people might be impacted.Those that remain, however, can expect to be folded into a company that prides itself on being democratic, where the chief executive encourages everyone to participate in discussions on the company’s internal social networking site, CynerGI.Where once Mr Read might have rallied the troops with a speech from Henry V, and quintessentially English Andy Green - another former Logica chief executive - might have used a cricket analogy, Montreal-based, hockey-loving Mr Roach has more of a frontiersman approach to management.One of his mottos, for example, is “if we can’t explain to our customers why we are doing something then we shouldn’t be doing it.”There is a lot of emphasis, he says, on just getting the job done. In an industry where on average only about 30 per cent of IT projects are delivered on time and on budget, Mr Roach is says CGI manages 95 per cent.For companies that can do this, he says, there is no shortage of work, even in the midst of the Eurozone crisis. The trick, however, will be whether he can get the Logica staff, who never quite managed to live up to their company motto of “being brilliant together”, to buy into the CGI dream.
125;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-07-17T14:00:39Z;Ten Questions - Susan Bulkeley Butler;The chief executive is focused on bringing about equality for women by 2020;"Susan Bulkeley Butler is the chief executive of the Susan Bulkeley Butler Institute for the Development of Women Leaders, which is focused on helping women and girls to fulfil their potential. For 36 years, she worked at Accenture, a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company, where she was the first woman hired. She later became Accenture’s first female partner.Ms Butler grew up in a farming community in Abingdon, Illinois and studied industrial management at Purdue University, where she has since established the Butler Center for Leadership Excellence. She has a business leadership award and an honorary doctorate in management from the university’s business school, Krannert School of Management. At Simmons College, she was endowed with an award in their MBA programme.In her spare time, Ms Butler enjoys travelling and needlepoint. She has written two books: Women Count: A Guide to Changing the World and Become the CEO of You, Inc. which is a call to action to take responsibility for your life.Ms Butler will be available for a live web chat on Thursday, 19 July 2012, between 15.00 and 16.00 BST. Post your questions now to ask@ft.com and they will be answered on the day.1. Why did you choose to study business?I’ve been in business my entire career – at first, I thought I would have my own retail business. Based on what was available to me upon graduating, I became a senior executive in the business and technology consulting field. The options for women in 1965 were limited, but I excelled with Accenture.2. Who are your business heroes?My heroes are Susan Anthony and Amelia Earhart (I see myself as being half of one and half of the other). Susan was all about equality for women and Amelia helped women realise they can do anything they set their minds to. Just like them, my true focus is to bring equality in sight for women.3. What would you do if you were dean of a business school for the day?Encourage students to become ‘the chief executive of you, inc’. By this I mean, take responsibility for who you are and who you want to be. Make things happen for you rather than let things happen to you. Wherever you are, assume you will be there for the long run. Don’t be a short timer – if you think short term, you’ll be short term.4. What is your biggest lesson learnt?No matter where you are, you need to demonstrate that you are able to perform in the position you want before you obtain it. You’re awarded a promotion as a result of the work you’ve done.5. What advice would you give to women in business education?Build confidence in yourself. We doubt our ability, even when others know we can be successful. Lack of confidence holds us back. Take a risk and do something you’ve never done before. Have a can-do attitude, but don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it.6. How do you deal with male-dominated environments?We, women, need to learn how to be confident and use our voices, not allowing ourselves to be spoken over at a table full of men. We need to ask for the jobs that will provide us with the necessary experience to be on the same playing field as men. Also, I would learn how to be a good golfer.7. How do you deal with pressure?When stress gets in my way, I relieve it by talking to someone. This is where mentors come into play and why they’re so important. Women let things grow inside and, as you know, a mountain is made out of a mole hill. Men let it out and get over it; the next day, you’d never know anything happened. We need to learn how to do this. Women spend too much time thinking about the past when they should be thinking about the future.8. What is your favourite business book?Good to Great by Jim Collins.9. If you could do it all again, what would you do differently?I would’ve gotten an MBA. This would’ve given me the experiences needed for more significant positions on senior leadership teams.10. What are your future plans?Bringing about equality for women by 2020, the 100th anniversary of women’s right to vote in the US. It’s absolutely necessary. The world must be a better place for our daughters and granddaughters around the world. It’s up to us to make change happen. We can do it if we put our minds to it. We can change the world.Compiled by Charlotte Clarke"
126;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-06-28T09:30:45Z;Risks, pay cuts – and an instinct to compete;Interview: Emer Timmons talks about the attributes and career decisions that led to her senior role at BT;"A female senior executive in the UK ready to admit to being extremely competitive is a rare find. But Emer Timmons is not coy on the subject.As president of BT Global Services UK, she has responsibility for a budget of about £4bn and for more than 17 years has held key roles at multi-billion pound telecoms and professional services businesses.Right from the start, she says, the instinct to compete “has been in my DNA”.Growing up as the youngest of five children in Ireland, Ms Timmons says she comes from a highly competitive family: “We have 16 university degrees between us and I grew up surrounded by finance people. I was naturally competitive as a child, I had to win – I couldn’t just have the odd dance lesson, or just ride my pony. I had to do it all, and compete,” she says.Her “very logical brain” coped well enough with maths at school, but it was when she went to university at the National University of Ireland that she excelled. She also studied for an international marketing diploma in French and Spanish as she didn’t want to be labelled as either “maths or languages”: “After my Spanish exam they did suggest it might be wise not to continue a career in that language – I had the oddest accent,” she says, laughing.She finds it hard to support women who cry foul when denied opportunities: “Everything is choice in your career,” she says.Joining Accenture in Ireland as her first job, it was not long before Irish entrepreneur Denis O’Brien, today Ireland’s richest man, spotted her and offered her a job – with a big pay cut.“He was an incredible man who immediately put me at my ease. Even at a young age I could tell he was going to be something big in the business world,” she says. “I was earning up to £30,000 a year, which was a lot of money, and he offered me £8,000 a year for what was essentially cold calling.”She would be a sales representative for Esat Telecom after it won a mobile licence in 1995. She took the job: “I took a calculated risk as he was so passionate about what he did.”She went from sales rep to strategic sales to sales manager to business development. “I learnt it was very hard work. People who are very keen to progress need to understand how to do the hard work. I would never ask someone to do something I hadn’t done myself, and we did work seven days a week,” she says.“My core strength is sales and through my career I have built the other skills that are necessary for a leadership role,” says Ms Timmons.She next moved to Energis, a “technology-driven communications company”, based in the UK and Ireland; John Pluthero and Archie Norman were chief executive and chairman.It gave her experience of working in a struggling sector – the telecoms market crashed and Energis went into administration in 2002 – but not before she had become country manager, run the Northern Ireland business, and made it top in the call centre market. “I learnt how important it is to focus on where your core is and where your assets are and how to try and make a difference to your customer,” she says.Mr O’Brien then provided another opportunity – and another “calculated risk”. She recalls: “He said he was up for buying a licence for a mobile telecoms company in the Caribbean. I had never been to the Caribbean before, and I flew into Jamaica on my own with about 10 bags. I knew it wasn’t going to be easy, but every role I’ve started has evolved into many others, and this was my first mobile role.”Speaking very quickly, she captures every detail. The small, privately held company, Digicel, founded by Mr O’Brien in 2001 with the launch of a GSM cellular phone service in the Caribbean, is today one of the fastest growing mobile operators in the world.“Every country in the Caribbean required different sales strategies; within a year we took the incumbent out of every country,” says Ms Timmons.She speaks very highly of her predominantly female team – “incredibly focused, with a very strong work ethic and an excellent understanding of how to multi-task, have a family and still study for university at night”.Recalling one Christmas when Digicel celebrated its millionth subscriber, she says: “I was still in Jamaica and was asked ‘how’s the family’ and I had to say I didn’t really know – I flew back on Christmas day.”Approached then by John Caudwell of The Caudwell Group, she became global managing director for 20:20 logistics, which used sales, marketing and logistical expertise to provide products and services to customers.“I remember going into Nokia and saying can I have a licence to operate and they said ‘No’. So I asked to be given a chance to prove myself in a few countries – and they gave me Afghanistan and Iraq.”While in the Caribbean she married an Englishman who took leave of absence from his job to allow Ms Timmons to do hers, but parental ill health led the couple to set up home in the UK.Using executive search consultants for the first time, she took a call from BT: “I had been approached before, but at a time when I felt my career was still international and entrepreneurial in a high-risk, high-reward environment where if you don’t deliver you get fired,” she says.Starting at BT in 2007 as vice-president for cross sector practices, then professional services, she was appointed president for BT Global professional services in the UK and the Emea region the following year. She was also responsible for the integration of all 31 of BT Global’s acquisitions, completed in a year.“People say you can’t bring an entrepreneurial spirit to a big corporation – oh yes, you can,” says Ms Timmons.The pressures of the job mean she has been unable to find time for enough flying hours to maintain her private pilot’s licence, gained at university.But her enthusiasm for delivering whatever it takes to succeed is undiminished: “Getting to the top means you have to manage your own career,” she says. And to women, she adds: “There is a mirror in the ‘glass ceiling’ and what is stopping you is you.”Secret CVWho were your mentors?Three people have made a big impact on me: Denis O’Brien, my external mentor; Helen Pitcher, chief executive of Iddas; and Ian Livingston, chief executive at BT Group.Your first big break?Going to work for Denis O’Brien at Esat Telecom.What else might you have done?I would love to be the captain of a Jumbo jet, a 747. I love flying, it’s the ultimate company car: to be able to rock up and say “fill her up”.Best career advice to othersYou need to decide very early on in your career what sector you want to be in and gain experience. Be self-critical and close the gaps where they exist. You can be whoever you want to be – it’s very important to have that self-confidence. It’s also important to enjoy what you do – you need to have fun doing it."
127;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Summer ad sales fears drag on ITV;;ITV was among the sharpest fallers on fears that its summer advertising sales would disappoint.“The indications we are hearing suggest the July and August TV advertising markets may be weaker than expected with reports some advertisers have cancelled planned campaigns,” said Liberum Securities.Customers have been delaying buying space until after the Greek elections, or switching budgets to coincide with either the Jubilee celebrations, the Olympics or football’s European Championships, according to media buyers.July and August are traditionally slow months for advertising so decisions were relatively easy to defer, they said.As a result, Liberum’s TV advertising market contracted by more than 10 per cent in July and by 5 per cent in August, with weakness across all the sectors.That would imply ITV advertising sales down 4 per cent or more in the third quarter, against expectations several weeks ago of 4 per cent growth, said analyst Ian Whittaker.Liberum retained “buy” advice on ITV shares, which closed lower by 5.7 per cent to 72.9p.The wider market completed its worst month since February 2009. The FTSE 100 closed up 9.67 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 5,306.95, giving it a monthly decline of 7.5 per cent.Admiral, the car insurer, dropped 7.2 per cent to £10.39 after the Office of Fair Trading said it had referred the industry to the Competition Commission.Forcing at-fault drivers to pay for courtesy cars to the victims of their accidents inflated premium costs by £225m a year, the OFT said.Admiral receives a referral fee from courtesy car hire companies of between £5 and £6 per vehicle, suggesting that the fees contributed about 10 per cent of its profits last year, said Deutsche Bank.InterContinental Hotels jumped 5.6 per cent to £15.26 after Trian Fund Management, the activist investor group headed by Nelson Peltz, said it had taken a 4.27 per cent stake.The stakebuilding triggered speculation that InterContinental would be under pressure to sell its 10 landmark hotels, which have a book value of $1.3bn.A fairer value for these assets would be about $2bn, or 430p per share, Oriel Securities said.Other options would be for InterContinental to fund a capital return with debt or redomicile in the US, where hotel operators attract higher valuations, Oriel said. It also noted recent speculation that InterContinental might be a target for a peer such as Marriott International.Counterbid hopes pushed Logica 68.8 per cent higher to 110.9p after the IT services group said it had agreed a 105p-a-share offer from Canada’s CGI Group.Companies such as NTT of Japan were mentioned among the potential interested parties, though analysts did not expect to see a higher offer.“For an Indian vendor, Logica would have been too big a pill to swallow,” said Berenberg Bank. “Atos is busy integrating its Siemens IT acquisition and Capgemini is focused on international expansion. Meanwhile, for a company like Accenture, it would be an unnecessary move.”Numis Securities saw the Logica bid as demonstrating that UK technology companies were materially undervalued.It saw software makers Sage, up 2.4 per cent to 256.5p, and Fidessa, ahead 2.3 per cent to £15.40, as potential targets.Miners were under pressure as weak US data led copper to a five-month low.ENRC slid 2.8 per cent to 422.5p, Kazakhmys was down 2.2 per cent to 665p and Xstrata faded 1.8 per cent to 922.5p.Aquarius Platinum erased a recent rally, losing 4.7 per cent to 73.4p. Goldman Sachs said Aquarius would need to refinance a $300m convertible bond that falls due in 2015.“Given the lack of cash generation and the future commitments, we believe Aquarius will take a prudent approach and, as a first step, cease dividend payments as well as close/mothball any operations or parts of operations that are not currently cash-positive,” Goldman said.Retailer Halfords fell 12.3 per cent to 241.9p on a warning that trading was “very disappointing”.3i was up 3 per cent to 174.7p after Simon Borrows, its new chief executive, bought 4m shares.Among small caps, Biome Technologies dropped 38.5 per cent to 0.08p. The bioplastics developer warned that sales had been below expectations, particularly in southern Europe.
128;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Factories begin to shift back to US;;Two-thirds of big US manufacturers have moved factories in the past two years, with the most popular destination being the US, according to a survey being released on Monday by Accenture, the consultants.The report provides some of the first industry-wide empirical evidence of “reshoring,” the trend of jobs once outsourced to low-cost emerging economies being brought back to the US.Although the subject has received much attention, with General Electric the most high-profile example, most of the evidence so far has been isolated and anecdotal.President Barack Obama has proposed tax incentives for companies that move their overseas operations back to the US and tax penalties for those that do not.“If you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a tax deduction for doing it,” Mr Obama said in this year’s State of the Union address. “No American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas.”Some 65 per cent of the senior executives questioned by Accenture said they had moved their manufacturing operations in the past 24 months, with two-fifths saying the facilities had been relocated to the US. China was the second destination for relocated factories, with 28 per cent, followed by Mexico with 21 per cent.Rich Bergmann, managing director of Accenture’s manufacturing practice, said the respondents cited freight and the speed of fulfilling orders as their main motivators for moving factories. The survey demonstrated that manufacturers are increasingly moving production closer to end-markets, he said.“There is evidence here of reshoring because of transportation costs and lead times,” Mr Bergmann said. “The global supply chain allows you to chase lower cost of labour, but the total costs are reflected in the decision on where you produce for a given geography.”In many cases – such as GE and Caterpillar – the relocation takes the form of expansion at existing US facilities. However, China remains the top destination for new factories among companies that are opening facilities, followed by the US, India, Brazil and Mexico.“Internal domestic demand in China and other markets in south-east Asia is behind the new facilities there – not so much for importing back to the US,” said Mr Bergmann.The survey also reveals that US manufacturers expect China to overtake Europe as their second biggest market within three years.Some 58 per cent of companies anticipate that Chinese demand will be one of their highest revenue generators within three years, up from 38 per cent currently, while 53 per cent predict that western Europe will be a leading source of revenue, down from 63 per cent today.
129;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-05-17T23:22:23Z;HP to axe 30,000 jobs to cut costs;;Hewlett-Packard is planning to cut as many as 30,000 jobs in one of the biggest mass lay-offs by a US company in recent years.While the exact number of job losses has yet to be set, some 25,000-30,000 of HP’s 320,000 workers are expected to be shed in the coming months, according to a person familiar with the plans.The reduction is set to come partly from an early retirement offer, this person said.The sweeping cuts signal a drastic attempt by Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, to deal with the company’s slumping fortunes. The most broad-based conglomerate among leading US technology companies, HP has seen its competitiveness erode in most of its main markets, including PCs, IT services and imaging and printing.HP’s planned job cuts rank among the 10 biggest by a US company in the past decade, according to US outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas.They could eventually rival the 30,000 workforce reduction announced by Bank of America last September, which became the biggest of 2011, though the move would still pale in comparison to the 60,000 jobs that arch-rival IBM slashed as it grappled with a crisis in the early 1990s.Many Wall Street analysts tie HP’s problems to a failure to invest enough in its wide-ranging operations under former chief executive Mark Hurd, who was forced out in 2010 after an investigation into sexual harassment allegations.Mr Hurd won a strong following among investors for delivering consistently higher earnings, though that view has been revised in the wake of his departure as HP’s performance has deteriorated.Mr Hurd’s replacement, Léo Apotheker, last year attempted radical surgery to revive the company’s fortunes, paying $10bn for UK software company Autonomy and proposing to spin off HP’s PC arm, but was sacked after shareholders rejected the moves.Ms Whitman, who made her name as chief executive of eBay and two years ago mounted an unsuccessful campaign to become governor of California, has hinted at significant cost cutting this year to deal with the problems. She has said that HP needs to save money in order to reinvest in its most promising businesses.Many of the job cuts are expected to come in HP’s services division, which has struggled to keep pace with industry leaders IBM and Accenture, as well as cut-price Indian outsourcing companies.Though bigger than any other cuts HP has announced before, the job reductions would mark the latest in a long line of restructurings at the company in recent years, many of them coming in the wake of large acquisitions. HP has reported restructuring charges every year since its purchase of PC maker Compaq Computer a decade ago, with the charges topping $1bn three times.
130;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-05-06T17:05:42Z;US ‘flash crash’ measures suffer delays;;Two years after the “flash crash” on Wall Street, US regulators have still not implemented some of the key measures aimed at preventing further wild swings in stock prices that have harmed market confidence.Chief among those unfinished proposals is the consolidated audit trail, intended to be a detailed record of millisecond-by-millisecond trading that the Securities and Exchange Commission could turn to for analysis of market aberrations like the 600-point swing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average over 20 minutes on May 6 2010.“There have been some good interim measures, but the larger, more important items have not yet been implemented,” said Christopher Nagy, head of order routing and market structure at TD Ameritrade, a retail brokerage.While the SEC acknowledges the urgent need for additional corrective measures, there has not been agreement on details of further proposals, people familiar with the commission’s thinking said. The agency has also been bogged down by rules related to the Dodd-Frank Act. The SEC does not comment on ongoing rulemakings.The SEC in 2010 adopted new rules such as circuit breakers to halt trade in single stocks when their prices move 10 per cent, and a ban on the stray price quotes that allowed stocks such as Accenture to trade at as little as a penny.But the circuit breakers have been criticised for creating more trading pauses. An alternative mechanism proposed by exchanges, known as “limit up-limit down” – which would allow more flexibility before trading was halted – has not yet been mooted as a rule by the SEC.The adoption of an audit trail, which was urged last May by Mary Schapiro, SEC chairman, has also been delayed. The estimated $4bn cost to the industry of the initial proposal attracted much criticism and the SEC’s revised scheme is now expected to cost $1bn. The commission has also backed away from an initial insistence that trading be reported instantly.The implementation of an interim rule that would force brokers to track trading by large customers has also been delayed by uncertainty about how to process the data.One area where the SEC is moving forward is on “dark pool” trading, which are markets in which prices are not displayed. The SEC said on Friday that it would extend a review of a January New York Stock Exchange proposal that would allow public exchanges to act as dark pools do, and allow trading at sub-penny increments.The proposal may give the SEC a way to address flash-crash concerns about liqudiity drying up in off-exchange venues, which have fewer regulatory obligations, during times of market stress.“The commission’s resolution of these issues could have an impact on overall market structure,” said the SEC.Volume of trading off-exchange has grown since the flash crash, hitting a record level in the first quarter, at 34 per cent.Critics have charged that worries about the flash crash, and the role played by automated trading “algorithms” and high-frequency dealing have chased individual investors away from equities.Since May 6 two years ago, retail investors have pulled $273bn from US domestic equity mutual funds, versus $174bn in the two years prior to the “flash crash”, according to figures from the Investment Company Institute.The average daily trading volume of US equities was also its lowest in April since December 2007.
131;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-04-29T16:18:33Z;Infosys plans international acquisitions;;Infosys, India’s second-largest IT and software group by revenue, is planning international acquisitions and a renewed focus on “bread and butter” outsourcing amid growing concerns over weak results and wayward strategy.Shares in Infosys dropped sharply following a reduced earnings forecast earlier this month, while analysts have attacked a strategy they describe as attempting to win high-end business at the expense of increasing revenues.The recently appointed chief executive S.D. Shibulal rejected the accusations while highlighting plans to expand aggressively into new markets, with potential acquisitions in continental Europe and Japan and even moves to grow within India itself.“We are definitely looking at opportunities for inorganic expansion,” he said, “towards either a deeper integration in a country or a deep capability being built, or an intellectual property being acquired.”Mr Shibulal is the latest of Infosys’ seven founders to lead the firm as it faces arguably its toughest challenge in three decades of operation, having lost ground to market leader Tata Consultancy Services and facing the risk of being overtaken for second place by newcomer Cognizant this year.Infosys faced sharp criticism following results this month, which warned of lower than expected revenue forecasts for this financial year of $7.5bn-$7.7bn, and included an unusual open letter from a respected Mumbai-based analyst at brokerage CLSA. The analyst questioned the group’s increasing focus on high-margin deals and its lack of clarity over plans to deploy its more than $4bn cash reserves.In response Mr Shibulal stressed that the company remained committed to winning low-end “bread and butter” operational work, in addition to the more specialised consulting contracts that pit the Indian group against the like of IBM and Accenture.“We are very focused on winning large outsourcing deals and we have at any point in time about 12 deals in progress,” he said, “but I want to be categorically clear. We will continue to grow both lines of our business”.As with most Indian IT groups Infosys earns the vast majority of its revenues in North America and Europe, where it has suffered as its main clients in areas such as financial services have delayed or reduced spending in the face of tough economic conditions.Mr Shibulal said the group would also renew its focus on emerging markets, including a new push for business in India itself, a country that has traditionally provided slender pickings for a homegrown outsourcing industry with global revenues projected to top $100bn this year.“India is starting to do well for us, although from a low base” he said, “Although we have always believed that our traditional services model will not apply in this market, so we have had to devise other models for India.”He highlighted an income tax processing centre in Bangalore, owned and operated by the group, with revenue earned from the state for each income tax form processed, as an example of a model suited to the Indian market.Yet, while admitting that Infosys had undergone a period of transition and strategic review since his appointment in August 2011, Mr Shibulal said he remained confident that the group would begin to recover towards the end of this year.“Strategies don’t create overnight success.

132;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-04-25T03:50:14Z;Indian IT finds it tough in China;;"Indian IT companies are conquering the world, from Latin America to Old Europe. But there’s one place they have yet to make a dent: China.Speaking to the FT after his company delivered a strong set of Q4 numbers and a bullish outlook, N Chandrasekaran, chief executive of Tata Consultancy Services, said China -whose IT market is estimated to be worth Rmb 1,840bn ($291.7bn) last year - remains a tough nut to crack.“China has been slow, frankly it’s been very slow – it’s been much tougher and we have a lot of ambition to grow, we want to grow there significantly,” he said. “We have three thousand people, but our interest is to grow to five thousand, ten, fifteen, twenty thousand people as fast as we can.”Though TCS has centres in six cities in China, Chandrasekaran said the bulk of the company’s business come from Asian operations of foreign multinationals – rather than domestic Chinese companies.Chief among the reasons for this are government regulations that make it difficult to transfer employees from city to city for different projects, the high attrition rate amongst employees, and prices.“The price points at which some of the local companies are operating are pretty low, so we probably are not there in the deals… or we find it difficult to execute,” he said.Sudip Apte, analyst at Offshore Insights, said TCS, and other Indian IT companies, weren’t alone: “Firms are finding it a little tough because scalability is an issue, government policies are challenging and different from other places,” he said. “It’s not just Indian companies, even Accenture or IBM haven’t been able to scale up.”TCS thinks it has found a solution in another large market that Chandrasekaran said was underpenetrated: it recently signed a joint venture agreement with Mitsubishi.“We think that Japan is a very important market, it has been a large market but very underpenetrated, and we have not been able to grow [there],” he said. “What [this JV] does is it brings the market knowledge and the relationships from Mitsubishi and the delivery expertise from TCS in the Japan market so our interest is using this as a mechanism in building deeper relationships.”For all his bullish outlook for the company as a whole, Chandrasekaran was markedly more sober, and emphatic, when it came to China: “The outlook is very, very, very moderate growth; very, very moderate growth, that’s the outlook for the next few years…much below the company average.”On the Mitsubishi JV, Chandrasekaran was quick to say that he “wouldn’t extrapolate that into other markets” – but it isn’t too hard to imagine the bullish company one day replacing the word “Japan” with “China” and Mitsubishi with a strong Chinese company.Related reading:

133;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-04-24T17:32:34Z;Cricket lover with plan to help TCS score;;"N. Chandrasekaran is more than a little partial to cricket metaphors. Numerous games are visible in the park outside his Mumbai office window, while inside the chief executive of Tata Consultancy Services talks bullishly about the outlook in European and American markets, following three years of tough conditions.“It’s like going to a cricket match when you know the pitch isn’t the best batting wicket,” he says. “If you know that, and if you’ve been warned about that, then how you are going to bat is very different.”India’s national pastime also features on a nearby table where Mr Chandrasekaran, normally known just as “Chandra”, is pictured next to star cricketer Rahul Dravid, a sportsman nicknamed “the wall” for his dependability in tricky situations.It is a role India’s largest IT and software group by revenue also sometimes seems to play in its sector. Its shares jumped more than 12 per cent after strong quarterly results, despite weak economic conditions in its most important industrialised markets.By contrast, second-placed rival Infosys’s weak forecasts last week caused shares to drop sharply, dragging the likes of TCS and Wipro down with it. But with net profits up 23 per cent to $558m compared with the same period last year and annual revenues of more than $10bn for the first time, Mr Chandrasekaran is understandably upbeat. “The market has responded because we didn’t strike a cautionary note,” he says, while also stressing that Europe’s debt crisis is far from over. “It’s going to be a bit of a rollercoaster for the next couple of years.”To sustain its pace of expansion, the group needs to up its game outside Europe and America, he says, and in emerging markets in particular. Take China. Here TCS has high ambitions but is making limited progress. “We have 3,000 people there, but our interest is to grow to 5,000; 10, 15, 20,000 people as fast as we can,” he says, before pausing and looking mildly pained. “But China is very slow, being frank with you. It has been much tougher than we thought.”With six offices in Asia’s largest economy, TCS is making some headway in financial services, traditionally its strongest industry, winning business from the likes of Bank of China. But the overwhelming majority of its small operation still comes from western companies expanding into the country.Progress with Chinese clients is minimal, while competition from cheaper local competitors is fierce. There are operational problems too, such as moving engineers between cities, which TCS say is due partly to cultural reasons: “Even if you have employees in Shanghai you can’t move them to a project in Beijing,” he says.Its difficulties are indicative of a broader dilemma facing the outsourcing sector, as it expands into emerging economies where local knowledge is crucial.“These are places where all the delivery is local. We do very little from India. Most of the work is executed from Mexico or Brazil, or Buenos Aires or Kyoto or Beijing,” he says.This means a renewed focus on “in-sourcing”, as TCS hires more local staff. It also means experimentation, as when the group launched a rare joint venture this year to crack the Japanese market, alongside Mitsubishi Corp.Wherever TCS operates, he says, the strategy is the same: win clients with one type of service, and then persuade them to buy in other areas too. “We do consulting, then we do a mobile app, then we do analytics, then we do infrastructure,” he says.In the industrialised world the gambit seems to be working, analysts say, at least compared with Infosys’s approach of hunting for the larger and more complex contracts that places them in competition with western companies such as Accenture.On the table by the door, for instance, next to the cricket picture, sits a red and white toy dog. The animal sports the logo of American shopping group Target, a gift from one of TCS’s largest retail clients and a symbol of the type of blue-chip western clients the group has become accustomed to winning.Now bringing more such presents back to India from emerging markets will determine whether Mr Chandrasekaran’s bullish outlook holds true in future."
134;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Poor outlook puts pressure on Infosys;;Shares in Infosys fell sharply on Friday as India’s second-largest outsourcer by revenue lowered earnings forecasts and warned of tougher global conditions for the country’s outsourcing industry.India’s IT sector is facing a range of competitive pressures as low-end business moves to countries such as the Philippines, and larger clients in western markets struggle against the economic slowdown, analysts say.Infosys’ share price fell nearly 13 per cent in spite of reporting revenues of $1.7bn for the fourth quarter, an increase of 22 per cent compared with the same period last year.The Bangalore-based company also gave lower than expected revenue forecasts for the coming financial year of $7.5bn-$7.7bn, underperforming the industry as a whole.S. D. Shibulal, managing director, said: “The year ahead looks challenging for the IT services industry, with slow recovery in the global markets.”India’s leading IT outsourcing companies earn the vast majority of their revenues in the US and Europe, where they increasingly compete against the likes of Accenture and IBM for larger and more complex contracts.Dipen Shah, an equity analyst at Kotak Securities, a Mumbai-based brokerage, said: “The guidance reflects the challenging macro scenario that Infosys is facing. We also understand that a part of the projected underperformance vs the industry is due to the strategy of not chasing low-margin business.”Existing outsourcing deals worth more than $47bn are estimated to be renewed in the coming financial year, according to a recent analysis from Standard Chartered in Mumbai, also potentially placing pressure on future earnings.The announcement of a smaller than expected special dividend of about $0.20 per share also dented market sentiment. The company holds cash and cash equivalents of $4.1bn, raising hopes of a larger payout.Infosys’ net profit for the fourth quarter rose to $450m compared with the same period in 2011, an increase of 27 per cent. However, revenues fell 4.8 per cent compared to the previous quarter.“We had a very difficult quarter with revenues declining sequentially,” said V Balakrishnan, chief financial officer. “The global currency market volatility continues to be a challenge for the industry.”Earnings per share rose 27.4 per cent to $0.79, while the company announced a final dividend payment of about $0.43 per share.Shares in Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, India’s other large IT groups by revenue, also fell on the news. At the close, Infosys share price stood at 2,402 rupees, down 12.6 per cent.
135;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-04-11T15:37:13Z;IT makeover delivers strategic advantage;Sainsbury’s two years into its big IT makeover;Planning technology investments so that they support and enable business objectives is a long standing challenge for all large organisations, particularly those in the fast moving retail sector.Figuring out the best areas to invest in IT to give the greatest value to the business is one of the fundamental challenges facing chief information officers and part of tackling this challenge is to get the IT and ‘C’ level business planning functions working together.This was particularly true at J Sainsbury, the UK-based supermarket group, which operates in a fiercely competitive market where the smart use of technology can enable a retailer to differentiate its services and reach more customers, thereby increasing its market share.Sainsbury took the strategic decision to bring its IT functions back ‘in-house’ in 2006 after outsourcing them to Accenture five years earlier and subsequently appointed Rob Fraser as CIO in mid-2009.Among his first initiatives, Mr Fraser simplified the organisational structure of the IT division, created a Technology Planning unit dedicated to longer-term technology planning and appointed Julian Burnett as chief technology officer to head up the new planning function.One of the first issues that Mr Burnett faced was that Sainsbury’s IT systems had started to become a little ‘long in the tooth’. “Certainly from an infrastructure perspective quite a lot of the hardware and software infrastructure was getting rather old and we needed to step into the renewal phase,” he says.More significantly he says, “Sainsbury’s business strategy had started to move ahead of the investment profile in IT and there was a bit of a disconnect between the IT capability, and what was required to support our business ambition.”The IT vision he says, was to be recognised as the best IT team in the retail industry and to deliver relevant technology systems in a simple, cost effective way would support the company’s growth plans.So, in May 2010, Sainsbury’s IT team led by Mr Fraser and Mr Burnett began to put together a five-year ‘road map’ that would address these shortcomings. This type of planning is known in the IT sphere as architecture-led planning or a ‘capability-led road map’ and can only be achieved when the IT function of an organisation works very closely and in a specific way with senior management from other functions within the business.To assist in the process, they brought in UK-based Glue Reply as a consultant. “Longer-term IT planning was not a feature of the division I joined, so when I arrived I had a relatively small team of folk available to me to do this,” explains Mr Burnett. “So I needed an expert partner.”Glue provided both an injection of expertise and the capacity to grow the IT team quite quickly. “Glue also came with some pre-built patterns of how to do road map development work which was helped us accelerate the project,” he adds.To facilitate collaboration between business units and the IT team, Mr Burnett set up a governance group he called the Enterprise Technology Board. “I used that as the vehicle to really get the thought process going about how long-term and short-term planning is different, and how planning together rather than planning separately can yield much more effective decision-making,” he says.Until then he says quite a few IT investment projects had been made in isolation without the benefit of collaboration across division leading to duplicated efforts. “Working together, combining all of the collected knowledge and wisdom from across Sainsbury’s business divisions with the IT team yielded a much more efficient and effective long-term plan for IT investment.”By October 2010, the IT team had the first draft of the new IT plan. “Actually quite a lot of time was spent not in developing the road map itself, but developing the approach that we’d take and engaging with our business colleagues to help them understand the difference between relatively short-term tactical and project-oriented planning, and more long-term strategic and enterprise-wide planning,” explains Mr Burnett. “I’d say that we probably spent about three months just talking about how we were going to do it.”But this effort paid off, he says, because Sainsbury’s operating board endorsed the first iteration of the road map with the full support of the chief executive. “More importantly for me, it was endorsed on the back of the recommendation that we got from everybody who had participated.”The road map was built around two classes of investment, explains Mr Burnett. “The first class of investment was ‘outcome-driving’ – the things that would deliver direct an attributable benefit to the outcomes and the strategies that Sainsbury is pursuing,” he says. “The second class of investment is in ‘foundational investment’, those things that underpin how we will deliver those outcomes over many, many years to come.”Foundational investment, in turn, was divided into two types, ‘IT foundational investment’ and ‘business foundational investment’. IT foundational investment mostly involves infrastructure modernisation. So for example, Sainsbury is actively ‘virtualising’ its servers – turning a single server into multiple ‘virtual’ servers which are much easier to manage, more efficient and cost effective.“Our ambition here is to move to essentially a private cloud compute model for our infrastructure, initially ‘on-premise,’ so within our own facilities,” he explains. “We are moving towards a strategy that won’t necessarily see us moving to public cloud but would give us that ability to should we choose to.”Sainsbury’s business foundational investments are the big long-running projects that have been identified as necessary to support the company’s long term business strategy. So for example, for the past 18 months, Sainsbury has been moving all of its online business on to a new multi-channel e-commerce platform.“When I say ‘multi-channel’, it is true multi-channel in that it will give our customers the capability to shop Sainsbury at home on, the move, in the store, in fact, with some new digital store capabilities as well,” says Mr Burnett. “It’s that classical any time, any place, anywhere and it is not only the ability to shop but also to access services and return products.He says some of the shorter-term projects that Sainsbury has implemented such as its ‘Click and collect’ scheme that enables customers to shop at home and collect in-store have already been a huge success and have now been implemented in almost 600 shops.The second big investment programme has been the upgrading of Sainsbury’s entire point of sales system. “We’re moving to the next generation of Point of Sale (POS) systems in-store,” he says. “They are interesting because they work in concert with our e-commerce strategy and will give us the ability to create a very much richer experience in-store for customers and to give customers a far greater choice of how they shop in the store. “So for example, Sainsbury, like most of its competitors, has implemented self check-out in its stores over the past few years. By combining its new e-commerce technology and its e-POS programme Sainsbury plans to give its customers the ability to use mobile technology actually in stores.“This isn’t necessarily shopping on your mobile phone while you’re on the bus,” explains Mr Burnett, “this is about being able to use your mobile phone to access enhanced product information, be provided specific targeted offers and promotions and ultimately being able to pay with your mobile phone while you are in the store.”Mr Burnett emphasises that delivering these features involves significant work behind the scenes on how to maximise the value and usefulness of customer information. “We are actively developing a unified view of customer information to see if we can drive greater value for customers by providing much more relevant offers to them,” he says.Sainsbury’s CTO also emphasises that the IT road map is not static and continues to evolve. “We know the world changes and we know things occur that we need to react and respond to, so our road map takes us on a course and we follow that course quite diligently, but from time to time things do occur that we need to respond to.”To accommodate these changes the company conducts a twice yearly that involves reappraising the outcomes and the benefits that Sainsbury is seeking and making adjustments in term of project priorities and sequencing where necessary.“If there are things that come into the plan that we need to respond to, we’ll find a place in the road map for them,” Mr Burnett says. “Now we can look at the capabilities that those new things demand and we can determine whether we’re already delivering something and therefore could bring it forward, or, if we’re not delivering it, then we can introduce it into the plan in a much more managed way.“In the past if somebody had rocked up to IT store and said, ‘right, I need this now,’ we would have gone off and done it and it could have created some unintended consequences elsewhere in the portfolio of work that we were delivering. Now, if somebody turns up and says ‘I need this now,’ we can step back for a few minutes, take a look at the impact and implications of that and introduce that project in a much more effective way into our overall delivery programme.”Overall Mr Burnett says that having a long-term IT enables the company to prioritise IT investment and that by taking a broader view it can lay down the foundations that will support the many changes required over the next five years. In addition he says it has focused attention on extracting the maximum value from IT investments. “People have recognised that you can get more for less if you work together to build one integrated investment programme and that if you do invest in an integrated programme, you can do it more quickly and more effectively.”At the same time, he says, “If you look at the balance of our IT capital versus operational costs, we’ve moved the ratio significantly in favour of investment, which is absolutely appropriate to drive the growth strategy that we have overall in Sainsbury.” Today he says Sainsbury is investing broadly twice as much as it spend on operational IT running costs compared to about a 50:50 split before he arrived.Two years into Sainsbury’s big IT makeover, he says the improvements and benefits of the integrated approach adopted by the IT department and business units are clearly visible. But he adds, the single biggest endorsement for the approach came when Justin King (Sainsbury’s CEO) likened the road map to the ‘Making Sainsbury’s Great Again’ (MSGA) strategy, to Sainsbury’s IT.“MSGA has been hugely successful in turning Sainsbury’s performance around over the past six years and I believe that the road map gives us an opportunity to do the same for Sainsbury’s IT over the next five years.”
136;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-04-10T15:16:03Z;Logica bosses turn down bonuses;;The top management of Logica turned down bonuses worth nearly £1m under pressure from shareholders after a year in which the UK-based IT services company lost a third of its value and announced 1,300 redundancies.Andy Green, chief executive, and Seamus Keating, head of Logica’s Benelux operations who resigned from the company last week, chose to waive bonuses for 2011 “given the impact of the restructuring announcement on people and shareholders”, according to the FTSE 250 company’s annual report.Despite a poor performance in 2011, which saw Logica issue two profit warnings, the executives had qualified for a bonus under a long-term incentive scheme with Mr Green eligible to receive as much as £600,000 worth of shares while Mr Keating was in line to receive as much as £337,500 in shares.Turning down the share award was seen by analysts as a gesture to appease shareholders, who have put pressure on management following last year’s profits warnings. Logica, which helps to run IT systems for clients such as the UK’s Cabinet Office and French energy group EDF, has been struggling with a downturn in orders since the eurozone debt crisis erupted.“It would have been hard to justify taking a bonus given that the company is in the middle of a restructuring,” said one technology analyst who declined to be named. “There would have been an uproar if they had taken the money.”Neither Mr Green nor Mr Keating qualified for an annual bonus after operating profits at the company fell from £272m in 2010 to £114m in 2011. This meant that Mr Green’s total pay fell from £1.23m to £767,000 last year. Mr Keating’s package dropped from £735,000 to £471,000.The long term incentive payments which they declined had already been reduced to less than half the level they received last year.Mr Keating also missed out on a special bonus related to turning round the ailing Benelux business which he had run for the past year and a half. The unit failed to meet targets, which included increasing profitability and orders, leaving Mr Keating ineligible to receive a share award.Logica, which competes against companies like Capgemini, Atos Origin and Accenture, in December announced a restructuring plan that would cost £93m, after seeing a drop in business in Sweden and the Benelux region.The company is cutting around 3 per cent of staff to reduce costs. In February Mr Green indicated that the outlook was stabilising, with sales unlikely to fall more than 2 per cent this year. However, Mr Keating’s surprise departure as head of the Benelux unit last week sparked concerns that turnround in the lacklustre Benelux business could be slower than expected.Logica’s annual report indicated an overall tightening up of incentive payments to management. The salaries of executive directors were frozen for 2012 and the remuneration committee added free cash flow levels as a new performance measure to the bonus scheme.

138;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-03-27T15:06:24Z;John Mack joins KKR as adviser;Wall Street veteran builds portfolio;John Mack, dubbed “Mack the Knife” for slashing costs while president of Morgan Stanley, has joined KKR as a senior adviser to the buyout group run by its co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts.The Wall Street veteran, who also had a stint running Credit Suisse, joins a roster of almost two dozen high profile advisers at KKR, which was immortalised in the book Barbarians at the Gate.KKR’s senior advisers, who counsel the firm on investments and serve on the boards of companies it owns, include several former chief executives, such as James Owens of Caterpillar, Arun Sarin of Vodafone, and Joe Forehand of Accenture, as well as Ford Fraker, former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and Lim Hwee Hua, the first woman to serve in Singapore’s cabinet.Mr Kravis, co-founder and co-chief executive of KKR, described the 67-year-old Mr Mack as a “great leader” who will “help make us smarter investors and strengthen our firm”.Mr Mack was chief executive of Morgan Stanley from 2005 to 2010, throughout the financial crisis. He oversaw a push into trading related businesses and was in charge of the investment banks when it reported its first ever quarterly loss in 2007 due to writedowns on subprime mortgage-backed securities.He also charted the group’s conversion to a commercial bank in 2008, so that it could borrow emergency funds from the Federal Reserve, and negotiated capital injections from the China Investment Corp and Mitsubishi UFJ, a Japanese bank. He stayed on as chairman until the end of last year.The sixth son of Lebanese immigrants, Mr Mack graduated from Duke University where he attended on a football scholarship and is a member of the board of trustees.

139;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-03-20T15:15:20Z;Big data: An increase in customer details raises privacy issues;Making best use of the constant stream of information can be business-critical, writes Kate Bevan;"“We used to think a terabyte was a lot of data.“These days, a terabyte fits on a hard disk you can keep in your pocket.” Edwin van der Ouderaa, head of financial services analytics at Accenture, a consultancy, has a point.As more and more of our lives – data from supermarket loyalty cards, photographs of the cat, geolocational tags, trips to a bar with friends – are lived online, so too the amount of data we share increases.This poses a challenge for businesses: how to manage the ever-increasing – and increasingly disparate – data that we generate every day, and how to use it.Making the best use of information is an infrastructure issue, and thus one for the chief financial officer setting priorities for the business.It is an important topic for the CFO, because these days, data are a window on the lives of customers. So making best use of that information is also business-critical.Problems around man­age­ment of huge amounts of data are increasingly pressing.Chris Knowles, head of solutions at Dimension Data, an IT services group, points out that sheer volume can get in the way of doing business.“If the data are too big to process, then they become valueless. For example, a business that relies on a process to make a decision might miss out on an opportunity if that process takes too long.”Huge amounts of data also put pressure on infrastructure: simple operations can take hours. Mr Knowles says there are four areas that CFOs must understand: storage, transportation, security and analysis of data.“Organisations need to start by classifying data,” he says. “What do you need immediate access to – and therefore have to keep in expensive primary storage – and what can be archived?”He suggests that for many organisations, some 75 per cent of data are dormant, but need to be stored for compliance reasons. This does not need to be in expensive primary storage; off site warehousing is cheaper.Many organisations are increasingly allowing staff to use their own devices – smartphones, tablets and laptops – for work. This raises obvious concerns about security, but also over the volume of data and even its legality.Someone’s personal laptop which connects to the corporate network will not only have spreadsheets and presentations for work, but could also contain music files that may have been downloaded illegally.If those files get on to the network, they take up space and are a compliance issue.And what about multiple copies of data? Mr Knowles points to the example of, say, a regular podcast from the chief executive.“There only needs to be one centralised copy of that,” he says. “But instead you end up with multiple copies in email databases as it’s emailed around and copies are saved on to hard disks – they all use space.”If data management is a business cost, then the need to make the most of data is even more critical.These days, businesses have access to so much information that they are “a bit like a child that has discovered a new toyshop,” says Mr van der Ouderaa. So, CFOs need to rethink their approach to analytics.“Most analysis techniques are still coming out of old-world relational databases,” he says. “There are now so many forms of data and new techniques and algorithms to sift through.”The other problem is privacy, says Mr van der Ouderaa. As the “internet of things” takes hold – from cars that constantly upload locational information, to devices in the home that can send information on, say, which adverts you watch on TV and which you fast-forward through – our “digital footprints” are becoming bigger and easier to track.“One of the first tasks is having a major rethink on what privacy really means,” says Mr van der Ouderaa.This is another question for the CFO, says Steve Jones, head of master data management at Capgemini, a consultancy.Privacy laws are already tightening and businesses need to be able to manage data intelligently: rather than having disparate chunks of information in separate databases.“At present, I need to be able to cross-check across the databases addresses, names, dates of birth to identify the individual across the business,” he says. “The business has to come together and this has to be driven top-down.”It is a dizzying array of subjects for the CFO to get to grips with.But says Mr van der Ouderaa: “CFOs are actually always at the forefront of technology. They’re the accountants: they know its value.”"

I first bump into Holly Branson, daughter of Virgin founder Sir Richard, and then group chairman Peter Norris. Jessica Collingwood, Virgin’s group people director, explains that she had previously attended a two-day course run by the FT’s Non-Executive Directors’ Club and was sufficiently impressed to inquire about the possibility of creating a bespoke programme for Virgin executives. “Our senior people are both executives and non-executives, so we worked with the FT to ensure we are supporting them to navigate between those roles,” she says. I leave them to get on with studying such topics as directors’ liabilities, conflicts of interest, and how to be effective. For details about the FT’s Non-Executive Directors’ Club, go to www.non-execs.com

●Wednesday Now who’s this in the FT building? It’s Helena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton Investment Management, photogenic founder of the 30 Per Cent Club, and high-energy role model to her nine children. She’s also here for an FT Non-Executive Directors’ Club event, speaking on a panel about “Women on Boards”. I went into the seminar convinced that gender quotas are, on balance, a bad idea. Ms Morrissey argued strongly against them, concluding that things are going rather nicely without and that Norway’s experience of imposing a 40 per cent female boardroom ratio ought to put us off. Yet I came out of the room thinking we must have quotas – 50 per cent representation – or 60. Why? Well, few can be impressed with the way chaps have run the shop lately, while most senior business women I meet are inspirational. And what if, in 10 years, Norway turns out to have got it right?

●Staying put Organisations seeking to hire the best professionals have their work cut out. A global survey by consultant Accenture, titled “The Path Forward”, found that even those dissatisfied with their jobs plan to stay with their current employers. Well over half the respondents were not happy where they are but would not move, with most citing flexible work arrangements as the reason for staying put."
141;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:30:00+0000;Execs in search of an EM strategy;;"While beyondbrics has a healthy scepticism for consultants’ surveys, they do sometimes throw up the odd nugget. Here’s one from Accenture:Forty percent [of executives] do not believe that their companies possess the strategic and operational capabilities to fully grasp the opportunities in emerging markets.That’s not a confident place to be. And it gets worse.From the report:The same proportion acknowledge that they do not fully understand the competitive dynamics they will face. Nearly one-third do not even believe that their company has a clear strategy for high-growth markets.This is despite the fact that 80 per cent of those surveyed said their company’s primary focus for growth was on emerging economies. In other words: we know which way the world is going, we know where we want to be – but we don’t what to do about it.And those surveyed feel under time pressure too:73 percent of respondents believe they need to accelerate their efforts, or may already be too late, to build satisfactory market share in these high-growth markets.There is accelerating and there is changing course:Some 57 percent of respondents to our survey acknowledge that they need to “reassess” or “fundamentally rethink” their approaches and capabilities to compete and win in high-growth markets.The survey (PDF) was conducted for Accenture by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which spoke to 588 business leaders in 85 countries and 22 industries.Related reading:

143;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-01-24T14:40:11Z;Service: Don’t rely on customers to volunteer views;Jane Bird looks at options for gathering feedback;Online customers seeking advice from Schuh, a shoe retailer based in Scotland, can click an on-screen button for a text or video conversation with a sales assistant.The web chat, which was introduced last October, is proving popular, says Karyn Stevely, customer service manager.“Response has been fantastic. We are taking as many calls via live help as through the phones. Feedback comments show that people like its simplicity and speed of reaction.”Consumers are familiar with video calls, online chat, instant messaging and downloading apps on to smartphones and tablets, says Natalie Keightley, contact centre product marketing lead for business partners at Avaya, the business collaboration and communications tools company.“They expect companies to recognise them and respond according to their preferred channel. The drive for multi-channel service is coming from them.”A study of consumers in 2010 by Accenture, the consultancy, found that 66 per cent thought service had improved in the past five years, thanks to growing use by companies of channels such as automated phone attendants, live internet chats and self-service options on websites.But a common mistake is companies moving too fast and not making it easy for customers, says David Klimek, a senior executive in Accenture’s customer relationship management group.“Many organisations rush to have a website, online chat, Twitter and Facebook, but they forget to think about how they all interact and are integrated.”Some companies that are really good on the web are poor on mobile, he says. Instead of multi-channel, they should be thinking about cross-channel.The goal is to be able to identify customers and know all their details and customer history, however they get in touch, says Mr Klimek.“If customers phone back after having spoken to an agent and talk to interactive voice response (IVR) that is unaware of their previous interaction, you lose the trust of those customers and they won’t want to come back.”Businesses also need to ensure they are able to adopt new channels quickly, says Ms Keightley.“If Facebook can go from nothing to $1bn in six years, who is to say that in another six it will even still be there? So companies need a flexible system that can adapt to dynamic fast-changing customer expectations.”Gathering feedback is crucial to providing good customer service, says Jamie Thorpe, head of commercial relations for learning and measurement at Grass Roots, a “performance improvement” company.But you cannot rely on customers volunteering to do so and you should avoid requesting it too often, especially for basic items such as shower gel, he says.“The other problem is that if customers take part in market research and express dissatisfaction, they expect a response, and they are much less forgiving on timescales than previously. They want instant responses.”Many companies engage in dialogue with customers on Facebook, but inviting comment on social media can be dangerous, says Mr Thorpe.“Objectors say that such feedback tends to be largely negative.“Often a single interaction gets a lot of coverage in the trade press, and if companies respond, it can turn into an online row with competitors.”More useful are satisfaction surveys conducted within two days of a customer’s interaction with a contact centre, typically by IVR or text message, says Mr Thorpe.Grass Roots does this for clients such as Santander, the bank.“It gives them a constant and up-to-date picture of how good the customer experience was, how likely customers are to come back and spend more, and their propensity to recommend.”Customers are also asserting themselves on when and how they interact, for instance wishing to determine the time of day at which they are contacted and the channel.They also want to design how information will be displayed to them on a company’s website, says Mr Klimek.“For example, they want to say which parts of their phone bill are included on the first page. In future, we’ll see a lot more control shifting to the customer.”Companies used to look for ways to save money on customer service, but now they see it as a differentiator, says Mr Klimek. To make the most of this opportunity, they need to rethink the role of service staff and decide whether they are going to use the same set of people, because a different set of skills is required.“When an increasing amount of customer contact is through IVR, online and mobile, this usually means calls to the agent are more complicated or require a greater level of skill, and more relationship building.”Time also has to be taken to walk people through self-service systems.Companies struggle to understand the additional time involved, says Mr Klimek. “But it is worth it because you can invest 60 seconds now to save 50 calls in future.”The primary goal is keeping customers loyal, but a byproduct is saving money.
144;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-01-22T19:39:36Z;Fall in numbers changing their banks;;The number of bank customers who moved their accounts to a different lender fell dramatically last year in spite of increased efforts by policymakers to drive up competition on the high street, according to research.Data compiled by Accenture, the consultancy, found that 11 per cent of consumers in the UK and Ireland moved at least one product from their existing bank in 2011, down from 16 per cent a year earlier.An even smaller proportion, 6 per cent of customers, switched their current account. Of those, almost a quarter found the process too slow or complicated.The figures will come as a blow to the government, which has trumpeted the increase of competition in retail banking George Osborne, the chancellor, has welcomed the arrival of new banks such as Virgin Money, which bought Northern Rock, as a way to increase choice for customers.The banking industry is working towards a new switching service that should ensure customers can move their current accounts in seven days without any hitches. The service, which was supported in the package of banking reforms laid out by Sir John Vickers last year, should be in place by the end of 2013.However, critics said it was unlikely to be a “silver bullet” as large numbers of customers have little inclination to move banks. Accenture found that of those who did not switch their current account last year, 90 per cent “had no desire to change providers”.Its findings came amid fresh claims that banks have failed to win back customer trust after the financial crisis.Consultants at Oliver Wyman said there remained a severe mismatch between what banks were charging for services and what customers were willing to pay.“This drives banks to be slightly obtuse – if they made their charging structures completely transparent, no one would want to pay them,” said Matthew Sebag-Montefiore, a partner at the management consultancy.Meanwhile, a survey of more than 20,000 European adults by Forrester, the market research firm, found that UK banks had some of the poorest relationships with customers in Europe. Under a quarter of British customers felt their bank put their interests above the desire to generate profits, even though some of the biggest institutions have invested heavily in public commitments to improve service.Meanwhile, perceptions of banks in Poland, France, Germany and even Italy, where banks have been severely affected by the eurozone debt crisis, improved, according to the Forrester poll.Three British lenders bucked the trend, with the Co-operative Bank, First Direct, a division of HSBC, and Nationwide Building Society rated highly by customers.
145;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-01-19T11:00:52Z;Strate holds venture talks with Clearstream;;Strate, the South African securities depository, is in talks with Clearstream, the custody and settlement arm of Deutsche Börse, about outsourcing collateral management in its domestic market to the European group.The move underscores how improved collateral management has become an urgent priority for banks facing pressure from new capital requirements under the Basel rules and as regulators from G20 countries push for greater collateralisation of over-the-counter derivatives.It underlines the ambitions of Luxembourg-based Clearstream to expand beyond its historical markets in Europe and the US. Last year it agreed a deals with Cetip, the Brazilian depository services group, and ASX, the Australian exchange and clearing group, on collateral management ventures.It is discussing deals with other central securities depositaries (CSD) around the world.Many regulators prevent assets used for collateral being taken out of the country but Clearstream’s technology allows assets to be kept in domestic markets, under local authority jurisdiction.Monica Singer, chief executive of Strate, told FT Trading Room: “We’re hoping by the end of the year we will have a solution up and running.” She added that Strate would be starting with securities lending.Collateral management is the part of its business that calculates and manages the amount of collateral that participants have to post as a guarantee of a trade.As new bank capital rules begin to bite, financial institutions and investors are looking to make efficiencies in all aspects for trading, to freshen up capital.Last year a survey by Accenture and Clearstream claimed that the financial sector could save $4tn annually by making collateral management more efficient. A CSD maintains a register of securities and provide custodial services, such as administrating corporate actions.Strate is the sole CSD in South Africa. It is 45 per cent-owned by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, with the balance being held by four local banks, ABSA, Nedbank, FirstRand and Standard Bank. Citigroup, the US bank, also holds a 0.1 per cent stake.Clearstream already derives about 20 per cent of its revenues from Asia, mainly through custody services to banks, exchanges and central banks.
146;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-01-11T18:58:30Z;Cross-cultural conversations;;"Miho Aizu used to be confident about communicating in English. “I visited overseas clients and held three-hour meetings, so I thought my English communication skills were fine,” says the 35-year-old manager at Accenture, the professional services firm, in Japan.But when Ms Aizu took part in a training programme that brought together colleagues from around the world, she realised that her skills fell short of what she would have liked. “During the team discussions, there were many things I wanted to say, but I felt I had to brush up my English language and presentation skills,” she explains.When it came to role-playing, Ms Aizu recalls: “I was told I needed to jump into discussions rather than wait until everyone had said what they wanted to say.”Her experience is not uncommon in Japan, where cultural inhibitions and a lack of fluency in English get in the way of smooth communication bet­ween Japanese and western colleagues. “There are many people who come to me and say they don’t know what Japanese people are thinking,” says Chikatomo Hodo, president of Accenture Japan. “Our people are more talkative than most Japanese, but they still have a difficult time communicating with foreigners.”As businesses increasingly ex­pand beyond national borders, western multinationals are taking the initiative to help staff in Japan improve cross-cultural communication skills.Goldman Sachs, the US bank, laun­ched a programme two years ago to help its Japanese staff interact both more comfortably and effectively with colleagues from around the world.Don’t be afraid to speak out.
Even if you make only a simple observation, it is better to participate in discussions than to keep silent in a meeting.Prepare thoroughly for conference calls and inform whoever is chairing the event beforehand that you would like to make a comment and might want an opportunity to jump in.Avoid phrases such as “this is just a silly idea but …”, which may express modesty in Japanese but make you appear lacking in confidence in a western context.Keep a note of talking points in case you run into the boss in the elevator.When sending an email or leaving a voicemail summarise your main points at the outset.Dubbed the “culture dojo” – after the halls where training in martial arts, such as judo and kendo, takes place – Sherry Greenfield, vice-president of Goldman’s human capital management division says the programme seeks to bridge the cultural divide by providing a forum to share experiences of working for a global business.“There are many people who are based in Tokyo who oversee all of Asia-Pacific,” says Takashi Yoshi­mura, managing director of Goldman’s compliance division in Tokyo and co-chairman of the culture dojo steering committee. “Goldman Sachs is global, with regions outside North America providing about 50 per cent of revenues. So, in order to make globalisation meaningful, it is important to enable local people to work globally.”Multinationals want to nurture global leaders in Asia, but find it necessary to provide Japanese and other Asian staff with more than the standard leadership training they provide to staff in the west.Some people easily fit into Accenture’s global leadership programme, Mr Hodo says, “but most Japanese people need an additional scheme”.Goldman has also extended its culture dojo programme to South Korea and China and plans to launch programmes in Bangalore and Singapore.A key objective of all of these programmes is to help Asian staff communicate more effectively with their western colleagues. Many Japanese and Asian people working with westerners find it particularly difficult to participate in discussions with their global colleagues.“It is important for them to learn what kind of people they are working with and to participate in discussions, because Asian people don’t stand out even if they are very good,” says Mr Yoshimura.Many western colleagues, for example, feel that Asian staff do not contribute much in conference calls. “But from the Asian perspective, western participants talk about things that are not very useful and they feel they can’t jump in,” he says.Mr Yoshimura adds that this is not just a language problem but a cultural one, too. “As the [importance] of Asia increases, more attention is being paid to this issue”, he says.In the western context, even a comment that is not quite to the point is contributing to the discussion. In contrast, Japanese people are less comfortable thinking out loud and feel that if they are going to speak up in a meeting they need to say something significant.“In my college [in Japan], people didn’t say anything that might make them look foolish, but at Harvard Law School people said whatever they wanted to say,” he recalls. His advice is to “overdo it a little”.Ms Greenfield concurs: for many Japanese, “if you feel like you are overdoing it, then it’s just the right level”.The communication programmes also provide guidance to Japanese staff on what is acceptable or even expected of them in western contexts. At Accenture, says Mr Hodo, “we teach them that even though it is said there is no nemawashi – behind the scenes lobbying – in foreign countries, there is actually a lot of nemawashi. We teach them when it’s OK to oppose your boss.”But overcoming cultural inhibitions is only a part of the broader aim of nurturing global leaders in Japan and other parts of Asia.Yosuke Yagi, senior human resour­ces manager at General Electric in Tokyo, set up a Japan-specific leadership programme and says Japanese people are not trained from an early age to be leaders. “In other cultures, they say ‘you should be number one,’ or, in the US, they say ‘be yourself.’ But in Japan …parents say ‘be friendly with every­one …be considerate, don’t cause trouble’,” he explainsGE set up a year-long programme for 15 people in Japan identified as having the potential to become global leaders. It also now offers training for its employees in China.Through this process, this GE elite is encouraged to think about what is important to them, what they want to do and how they can achieve that. “They have to have a core, a philosophy,” which gives them the drive to feel like starting something, says Mr Yagi, who admits to “pushing participants and embarrassing them” into thinking about what it is they really want to do.Participants are also encouraged to think about what makes someone a leader and whether they themselves want to become leaders.There are tentative signs that these programmes are having an impact.At Accenture, Satoshi Tanaka, senior manager of human resources, says: “After various training program­mes, I am more able to say what I need to say, without worrying too much about the exact words.”Mr Yagi says the effects of GE’s programme are becoming clear. “They become self-starters,” he says. “Rath­er than wait for someone to tell them what to do, they have started to go for it themselves.”The change is even noticeable in the “town hall” meetings that Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, holds when he visits Japan. Until recently, “as soon as the Q&A began, there was silence,” says Mr Yagi. “Nowadays, when Mr Immelt comes, people will line up to ask questions.”This article is subject to a correction and has been amended."
147;ACN;Accenture Plc;2012-01-05T20:03:10Z;US groups have $2tn to play with this year;;The biggest US companies may have as much as $2tn in cash available to spend in 2012, powering a potential surge in share buy-backs and dividend payments.A combination of cash on the books plus low levels of leverage and strong expected profits add up to just under $2tn that could be available for non-financial groups in the S&P 500, according to figures compiled by JPMorgan Chase.Amid a struggling global economy, US companies in most industries have been hesitant to launch major new investments or complete large acquisitions, and have been primarily using cash to repurchase their shares and pay dividends.“If more firms were optimistic about the future and seeing new opportunities, this money could go to investment,” said Marc Zenner, head of Corporate Finance Advisory at JPMorgan. “Doing share buy-backs is a less risky option, especially when valuations are low. It shows capital discipline and enthusiasm about the stock’s future, and can also fend off activists,” he said.With large, non-bank companies continuing to delever from peak levels in 2007, the average debt-to-earnings ratio of two times is below the 2.4 times average seen from 1996 to 2009. They also have 11.3 per cent of their assets in cash on average, versus 7.3 per cent from 1996 to 2009.If these figures reverted to historical averages, in part through new issuance of debt, it would generate about $1.2tn in cash, JPMorgan said. That would be in addition to roughly $800bn of cash on hand and anticipated 2012 free cash flow.Last year, large US corporates spent $336bn on share buy-backs from the fourth quarter of 2010 through the third quarter of 2011, the most recent quarter for which figures are available, the most since 2007. They also raised dividend pay-outs by 11 per cent in 2011.Some $40bn of those buy-backs were financed by issuance of debt. Fitch Ratings has projected that figure will probably increase this year, as yields for the most creditworthy corporate borrowers are near record lows due to investor demand for the relative safety of bonds.“I don’t think buy-backs are going to slow. There’s so much cash on the sidelines that shareholders want,” said Robert Leonard, managing director of the special equity transactions group at Citigroup.Mr Leonard projects that buy-back activity will remain in the $75bn-$100bn a quarter range, and that companies will continue to raise dividends, given investor demand for yield.Groups such as Intel and Home Depot raised debt to fund share buy-backs of more than $2bn last year. Companies that enter 2012 with cash greater than 10 per cent of assets and low debt include many software companies, such as Microsoft and Google, but also groups such as MasterCard, the payment processing firm, and Accenture, the consultancy.Cash spent on shares and dividends has also been a positive factor for the stock market’s performance during a volatile year. The $2tn in cash represents some 10 per cent of the market value of large US non-financial groups.
148;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-12-27T19:17:13Z;Company fears for NHS IT contract;;A US company with a pivotal role in the troubled programme to upgrade the National Health Service’s IT systems could lose more than $1.5bn after a fresh effort by the government to staunch further costs to the taxpayer.In a filing with US regulators on Tuesday, Computer Sciences Corporation, a Virginia-based IT services company, said it had been “recently” informed that neither a memorandum of understanding drafted last May nor a series of subsequent amendments under discussion would now be approved by the government.The move marks an apparent reversal from the government’s position earlier this year that it would be cheaper to maintain the contract because of the risk of penalties or damages linked to cancellation.While anticipating further talks in January, CSC said it would be required to show a material impairment in its third quarter 2012 accounts that “could be equal” to its net investments until the end of November this year of £943m, plus additional costs.“Today’s [Tuesday’s] announcement is clearly a negative surprise,” said Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at the New York investment bank Jefferies, who has followed CSC’s pursuit of the NHS deal. “Investors recognised the NHS contract was a source of ongoing risk, but the company had always indicated a contract would be agreed in some form.”In the latest of a series of reports attacking the management of the NHS IT programme, the National Audit Office in May concluded that programme was “falling far below expectations and the core aim that every patient should have an electronic care record under the programme will not now be achieved”.Launched in 2002 with a budget of £11.4bn and designed to give every NHS patient electronic records by the end of 2010, the NHS IT programme had cost £6.4bn by March this year with revised contracts aiming to complete the system by 2016.CSC took on the programme in the north, Midlands and east of England in 2007 from Accenture, the original contractor, which wrote off $450m. But the NAO found just four of 97 systems had been delivered in the regions to acute hospital trusts in seven years and the work was unlikely to be completed by 2016.The report said the £2.7bn spent by 2011 on electronic patient care records “does not represent value for money …and, based on performance so far, the NAO has no grounds for confidence that the remaining planned spending of £4.3bn on care records systems will be any different”.Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, announced the scrapping of plans for a national patient database in September, arguing it had “let down the health service”. With talks stalled, CSC repaid £170m of a £200m advance from the NHS in September.The Department of Health said on Tuesday: “We are in discussions with CSC and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this point.”Mike Laphen, CSC’s chairman and chief executive, told analysts last month he had “resumed discussions [with the NHS] with a target of reaching an agreed way forward by the end of 2011”. But its latest filing conceded fresh proposals were likely to “differ materially from those contemplated” by the original memorandum of understanding.Shares in CSC fell 7.7 per cent to $24.43 on the news.
149;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-12-21T19:14:05Z;Oracle: big issue;Expectations must be trimmed for all business technology vendors;Stock market bulls have argued in recent years that, while spending by indebted consumers and governments is likely to remain sickly, big companies, which are enjoying record profitability and strong balance sheets, are in rude health and will spend to grow further. The 14 per cent fall in Oracle’s shares early on Wednesday after its weak earnings report suggests that this particular stool’s one good leg is becoming wobbly.Oracle sells more software to big companies across industries and geographies than anyone else. In the past quarter, new software licence revenues grew just 2 per cent, a 10th of the rate of a year ago. It appears that those robust global companies are feeling a bit cautious. The pressing issue is what this means for the earnings of other big business technology vendors. These fit into two camps: the slow-growing value plays, and innovative growth plays (Oracle falls between the two).Consider a representative sample of the former – IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, SAP, Dell and Xerox. Analysts expect near-term sales growth in the 3 per cent to 4 per cent range on average. Even this may be a bit optimistic, but the reason to own these stocks is their cash generation and low valuations more than their revenue trajectory. For the latter group – EMC, VMware, Salesforce.com, NetApp – the outlook is for strong double-digit growth. If the slowdown reaches cutting-edge parts of data storage, virtualisation and cloud computing, look out.Oracle is not a perfect bellwether. Last week’s results from technology services leader Accenture were solid. Business technology spending has not simply stopped. But Oracle’s results are unsettling, not just for other technology companies but for companies and investors who have hitched their financial wagons to the fortunes of the world’s largest companies.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
150;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-12-15T17:06:29Z;Growth areas: Overseas investors are not just here for the engineers;James Boxell reports on a 40 per cent rise in projects in the service sector;While France is best-known for its manufacturing landscape and industrial heritage, it has seen a big increase in the number of foreign companies investing in business services and software recently.According to Ernst & Young, seven of the top-10 foreign job creators in the country last year were either involved in providing services to companies, distribution or software.Accenture, a consulting firm, created 875 new jobs, while Wipro Technologies, an Indian software group, hired 300 new staff. Amazon, an online retailer, was not far behind with the creation of 277 jobs.Overall, there was a 40 per cent increase in foreign projects in the domain of business services compared to the previous year. One in five foreign-created jobs in France last year were in business services.The worry, according to analysts, is that much of this expansion was connected to the return to growth of the French and European economy, however weak that has been. With many economists now predicting a return to recession in the eurozone, there is a fear that it will have an impact on business services.The problem also comes from the type of outsourcing services that France hopes to foster. It is trying to tap in to demand for “near-shoring” of back office jobs by its European neighbours, who want to outsource but are unwilling to send the more specialised, sensitive and high value jobs to emerging markets or eastern Europe.Clearly, if western Europe’s economy stays in the doldrums, there will be fewer back office jobs to outsource and greater pressure to shift more of them to lower-cost countries.It is also worth stressing that while services are increasing in importance, foreign companies are still largely interested in the country for its manufacturing and engineering.David Appia, chief executive of the Invest in France agency, says: “The number of projects in services keeps growing. We had 250 of them last year so it is clearly becoming more important, but manufacturing activities remained predominant, which is good news for a country in which industry is such a strong part of what we do.”Invest in France says there is also evidence that foreign investors are continuing to invest in French plants, despite competition from cheaper alternatives in central and eastern Europe, because of the skills and education levels of the French workforce.The agency says one large US company, not yet ready to be named, is putting the final touches to a new investment in France after deciding that the country’s support for a local plant had lifted its productivity to such a degree that it offset the far cheaper labour costs available in east Europe.“When you have a very sophisticated plant you need the proper people, well-trained and qualified to run these things,” Mr Appia says.Such anecdotes will be welcome to the French Treasury, when it considers statistics about the importance of foreign investment in French manufacturing. According to the last available data from Insee, the national statistics body, foreign industrial subsidiaries provide jobs for a quarter of the industrial workforce and generate a third of turnover.Ernst & Young estimates that industry accounted for 57 per cent of the new jobs created by foreign investors last year, an 8 per cent increase on the previous year.One worry is that many of these jobs were created in the car-making industry, usually the first to suffer from the impact of a recession on consumer spending.An area where the country could do better, according to most impartial observers, is in the field of renewable energy – particularly given the country’s commitment to increase the amount of electricity it gets from renewable sources to 23 per cent by 2020.In line with the rest of the developed world, the country has seen a sharp increase in renewable investments in recent years, but there is a feeling that it must do more.While the country is pioneering offshore wind farms, there has been disappointment about the lack of support given to the photovoltaic industry, allowing Germany an advantage in the creation of solar panel technology.If France is to maintain the strong attractiveness of its industry, a more enlightened policy looks necessary.
151;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;‘Big Four’ reforms would force rebranding;;The European Commission’s plan to break up the four biggest accountants would also oblige them to rename large chunks of their businesses, it emerged on Wednesday.Giving further detail of sweeping reforms to the audit profession, Brussels said the changes would force PwC, Deloitte, Ernst & Young and KPMG to carry out a partial rebranding as well as a restructuring.The Commission wants the “Big Four“ networks to split their audit and consulting businesses in the European Union as a way of making auditors less prone to conflicts of interest following their failure to warn investors of the banking crisis.The reforms unveiled on Wednesday aim to achieve this within the next 3 to 5 years by using a system of thresholds to determine whether an accounting firm is too big to remain integrated.The Commission said any businesses hived off as a result would not be able to keep their erstwhile parent’s name. “There will have to be changing of names,” said Claire Bury, its acting director of capital and companies.However, it was unclear on Wednesday whether the Commission might allow such a firm to preserve a vestige of its old identity in its new name.Professional services firms have a mixed rebranding record. PwC’s old consulting business invited derision when it chose to call itself Monday in 2002. Accenture proved a more durable choice for the former Andersen Consulting.The Big Four on Wednesday attacked the Commission’s break-up plans. John Griffith-Jones, joint chairman of KPMG Europe, said the proposals would deny auditors access to the expertise of consultants in its advisory arm.“Our ability to do good audits is absolutely, critically dependent on having total access to the advisory capabilities within our firm,” he said.The CBI, the UK employers’ body, said the reform package would add to business costs at a precarious time. “These proposals are the latest in a long line of unnecessary distractions coming out of Brussels,” said Matthew Fell, a director.To avoid being broken up, firms would need to garner less than a third of their audit fees from big clients or be part of a network collecting less than €1.5bn a year in audit fees from within the EU.Senior Big Four accountants argued that not all of their member firms would necessarily be affected, adding that some audit work could also be voluntarily abandoned to ward off a break-up.The Commission’s reforms could still be altered before becoming law. Other measures it favours include a requirement for companies to change audit firm at least once every six years – or every nine years if they appoint two auditors.
152;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-11-24T10:09:27Z;Recruitment Diary: November 24 2011;;"●Winning ways You might not think the job interview has started as you approach reception – but six in 10 managers seek the opinion of assistants, including receptionists and PAs, when evaluating candidates. A study by OfficeTeam, which provides staffing services, has produced five rules for interviewees: treat everyone you meet with respect – they might all have a say in the hiring decision; be prepared – take an extra copy of your CV, for example; only give authentic replies (ie, do not say “my greatest weakness is that I work too hard”); let the interviewer talk, too – it can be enlightening; don’t be anxious and rush to fill awkward pauses between questions by rambling.●Skills I am generally sceptical about claims of a “talent shortage” – I reckon people are as clever as ever, and that the demands of businesses are what have actually changed. Here’s David Smith, managing director of Accenture Talent & Organization, talking about his firm’s US research into skills: “Our study shows that workers are prepared to improve and expand their skills, but they’re not receiving sufficient support to develop those skills. In addition to investing in training, employers will have to become more transparent about their talent requirements and more creative about leveraging the skills they already have within their organisations.” The survey found 55 per cent of workers in the US felt under pressure to develop skills to be successful, but only 21 per cent said they had acquired new skills through company-provided formal training during the past five years.

●Flexibility Is this another small nail in the coffin of our ancient nine-to-five working culture? It seems that flexible working enables small and medium sized businesses to serve customers better. In research commissioned by Avaya, the business collaboration and communications tools provider, into the impact of flexible working on SMEs in Germany and the UK, 84 per cent of decision-makers were positive towards flexible working. Their most pressing overall need in meeting customer demands was finding more effective ways to balance staff resources and skills to make them more responsive to the market. Just over half believe flexible working helps them to recruit and retain a loyal workforce – one of the most important contributors in offering good customer service. Michael Bayer, president of Avaya in the Emea region says: “Employees need to be more connected, mobile, contactable, agile and responsive.”"
153;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-11-16T15:31:16Z;Pro bono: ‘We didn’t want to just turn up with an army of people to paint something’;Sarah Murray looks at what individuals and organisations on both sides can gain from charitable projects;When Thomas Sheppard, an IBM global business services consultant, worked with the city of St Louis, Missouri to design strategies to lower crime in the city – part of IBM’s Smarter Cities Challenge, a competitive grant programme – he found himself living with colleagues in a shared house where they all cooked for each other.For Mr Sheppard, this was a new experience. “IBM being a very virtual company, you don’t necessarily have an assigned desk, so this definitely brought us closer,” he says. “We were a lot more connected than we’d typically have been working on a regular project together.”Hakim Yadi, a healthcare technology expert at PA Consulting Group, also experienced this when he worked as project manager on a pro bono assignment with Cancer Research UK. The project is to develop cost effective tests for patients with cancer and to produce research data allowing the development of personalised medicines.To execute the project, a diverse team of consultants were drawn from the company’s government and project management teams, as well as from the technology and innovation practices.“I knew people in each of these departments but not these particular individuals,” says Mr Yadi. “So this was a new team that wouldn’t necessarily have been brought together otherwise.”However, bonding with colleagues is not the only thing that consultants gain from pro bono projects. For many, they provide a chance for executives to work with very different clients from those they would encounter in their day-to-day jobs.“The charity sector works very differently from the private sector, says Mr Yadi. “It was interesting being exposed to a new type of organisation and the way they work.”What also characterises today’s pro bono engagements is that many consultancy firms are working to match the projects and partner organisations with the skills of the consultants.“We didn’t want to just turn up with an army of people to paint something,” says Tony Schofield, partner at Deloitte and lead partner on the company’s work with Help for Heroes, a UK charity set up to support Britain’s wounded servicemen and women.“That has its values,” he explains. “But given what Deloitte has to offer we thought getting trained IT consultants to paint something didn’t make sense. So we’re using the horsepower in a different way.”A similar approach has been taken at Accenture, where the company’s Skills to Succeed programme aims to equip 250,000 people round the world with the skills to get a job or build a business.In designing the programme, Accenture thought about the kind of project that would fit well with the skills of its executives and its capacity.“We’re looking to move towards alignment of all our activities,” says Adrian Lajtha, chief leadership officer at Accenture. “And increasingly we know what the best outcomes look like in terms of the biggest impact we can make – and that’s where we can bring to bear the capabilities of our people.”Accenture works with a range of non-profit partners across the world. For example, Ericka Cogne, a manager in France, worked with Passerelles Numériques, an organisation that helps disadvantaged young people in Cambodia and the Philippines gain IT skills.Claudio Morales Oyarce, a senior manager in the UK, works as Accenture’s senior relationship manager with the Bright Ideas Trust, which helps displaced government workers start businesses.Accenture’s Lajtha believes that, in addition to acquiring skills, consultants working on pro bono projects also gain a powerful form of professional development. “There’s a significant leadership development experience that comes from this,” he says. “We’ve found those that have stepped out to work on this and come back have found it to be an accelerator to their career.”Of course, the services are also extremely valuable to the non-profits – often more so than charitable donations. Deloitte, for example, has worked with Help for Heroes on improving its management and organisational structure, changing leadership practices, transforming its IT systems and offering real estate expertise.“That expert advice hasn’t cost us anything,” says Bryn Parry, chief executive and founder of Help for Heroes. “And it’s taken us into a totally different league of what we’ve been able to deliver for our beneficiaries.”For Paul Winter, chief executive of Corpra, a consultancy, this kind of impact is important. “We want focus on the client, and not on ticking off community service hours,” he says. “And we expect our people to make things efficient and effective and not worry too much about their popularity.”Nevertheless, as they take on more strategic pro bono projects, consulting firms are increasingly recognising the benefits that these projects also bring back to their organisations.And among the most powerful, say companies, is that because individual consultants are so keen to work on pro bono assignments, the projects are effective employee engagement tools, helping consultancies to attract and retain skilled executives.Nevertheless, benefits to consultants can be more informal, too. “The really valuable part for the Deloitte people is that when they come to our place they can wear jeans,” says Mr Parry.
154;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Financial services: crisis brings opportunities to grow and add value;Firms that can add to efficiency will succeed, says Ross Tieman;"Not every storm produces a rainbow, but for consultants the crock of gold created by the financial tempest continues to spill over.Demand for advice from banks alone lifted income of UK-based consultants 35 per cent last year to £721m ($1.15bn), almost matching its fastest-ever 40 per cent growth in 2006, according to the Management Consultancies Association.According to a June report from Sourceforconsulting.com focused on midsized and large consulting firms active in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa, financial services provided €7bn ($9.5bn) of consulting revenues across Europe in 2010, 28 per cent of all consulting work in the region. Banking alone was 19 per cent, or €4.75bn. Drivers of demand growth remain strong.Industry consolidation and corporate reshaping arising from the financial crisis are only part of the story, however.Debt crisis initiatives are adding to the regulatory projects required under Basel III, Solvency II, international financial reporting standards and Europe’s Retail Distribution Review.Already, as Kevin O’Reilly, partner and head of financial services, consulting, at Deloitte, says, “there is a risk the regulatory agenda is going to demand more than banks can afford”.In the battle for contracts, the ability to add to corporate efficiency by providing risk analytics, data, or business efficiency has become decisive.David Field, executive director of Rule Financial, which provides business and information technology consultancy to investment banks in London and New York, concurs. “Banks are looking to combine regulatory compliance initiatives with innovation drives,” he says.The next wave will test the financial consulting industry as never before. In Europe, rescuing the euro has added to capital needs. In the US, says a study by Alvarez & Marsal, the restructuring specialists, a third of regional banks must merge, while banking in sub-Saharan Africa needs transformation and expansion, according to Roland Berger, a German strategy consultancy.Tomorrow’s financial consultancy challenges extend beyond banking. The worldwide insurance industry is still growing and attracting new contenders seeking to be more customer-focused. “Working with these and banking’s new entrants provides a fresh category of work, with different project characteristics, for consultants,” says Mr O’Reilly.For, as Rollo Burgess, financial services expert at PA Consulting Group, points out, many universal banks find themselves at a strategic crossroads. Their managers are often at full stretch dealing with a flood of regulations targeting their investment banking arms. That leaves their retail banking sides vulnerable to new entrants seizing the opportunities afforded by technological innovations such as social networking.Likhit Wagle, global banking and financial markets leader at IBM Global Business Services, says that initiatives to reduce retail banking complexity that cut cost-income ratios to 35 per cent in mature markets, or the 25 per cent achieved by Chinese banking leaders, will create the funding for programmes necessary to increase revenues.He says that vanguard universal banks are wrestling with rebuilding investment banking margins while simultaneously exploiting opportunities to leverage changing consumer technology to improve returns in retail banking.Sushil Saluja, managing director of Accenture’s financial services practice in the UK and Ireland, observes: “The economic uncertainty has polarised financial services firms into those that are using it to gain competitive advantage and those that have to focus on day-to-day business management to survive.”Future consultancy challenges also cross borders to an unprecedented degree. Navigant Consulting highlights the international reach of the Obama administration’s Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which will require foreign banks hand over information about Americans that have accounts with them. The compliance cost to European institutions alone could total billions of euros.Most advisory firms find solutions in a combination of structural reform and information technology. Accenture says it helped a leading investment bank shave $2bn from an $18bn cost base by redrawing departmental boundaries, sharing cost bases and moving some jobs to cheaper locations. But typically, it says, the task is to redesign the process and then implement the necessary technology.As Mr Burgess at PA Consulting emphasises, it is difficult to foresee how the world of financial consulting will evolve over the next few years. His best guess is that in traded financial markets, banks’ managers will become increasingly able to design and implement reform. Where they need extra help with implementation, consultants will be under intense competitive pressure, particularly on price.At the retail end, he believes advisers will need to focus on innovative answers that increase revenues to bolster customer engagement. This need is noticeable in hiring trends. PA Consulting, a niche player, is recruiting heavily, while Ernst & Young increased its specialist team by 40 per cent last year.IBM’s Mr Wagle sees five essential success factors for financial services consultants over the next five years.These are: industry knowledge and deep banking domain expertise will become more critical; previous experience will be necessary to reassure clients that their projects will succeed; consultants will have to support implementation; clients will be looking for outcome-based fee structures that reflect achievement of key performance indicators; and globalising clients will be looking for global support.But that leaves an unstated conclusion: consultants that do not fit the bill might usefully invest strategic thinking in their own business prospects."
155;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Public sector: firms look beyond Europe as cuts take toll;Fiona Czerniawska finds teams are being reassigned amid curbs on spending at home;The last time Stewart Johns pitched for some central government consulting work he found himself competing against hundreds of other firms. As the head of Boxwood’s public services practice, he has now decided it is worth putting in a bid only if he knows the organisation and people involved beforehand.Boxwood is one of the lucky ones. Smaller firms specialising in the UK public sector have been hard hit, with some going out of business entirely as the government cut spending on consultants to pre-2004 levels.The picture since April this year is more mixed. “Central government departments are clearly purchasing less consulting,” says Keith Leslie, one of the leaders of Deloitte’s public sector practice in the UK, “but there is substantial work in specialist services such as financial advice, property, organisation design and governance.”But, with no evidence of more widespread demand, consultancies have been reassigning their public sector teams. Some of Accenture’s consultants are now working in Mexico and South Africa.“We’re taking expertise from the mature markets to emerging ones, many of which are now looking to develop world-class public services,” says Sean Shine, Accenture’s managing director for health & public service in Europe, Africa and Latin America.Big firms have also been able to move their consultants on to private sector projects, avoiding widespread redundancies – a genuine fear this time last year. Kru Desai, head of public sector consulting at KPMG, says: “One of the benefits of scale is that we can rebalance our business, exploiting the economic cycles in different parts of the economy.”There are good reasons to believe that the UK public sector’s use of consultants will rise, albeit slowly. Redundancy programmes in Whitehall may result in a shortage of the skills needed to deliver further savings in the future.“Government departments and local authorities are losing good people,” says Steve Bannister, head of UK consulting services at Turner & Townsend. “They’re likely to need outside help, especially when it comes to more sophisticated cost-reduction programmes.”Dave Allen, consulting clients and markets leader at PwC, says: “Ministers may get frustrated with the pace of change and how to get economic growth moving again.”Both are gaps that consultants may be asked to fill. Against this is fear. The consensus in the consulting industry is that the reputation of consultants, at least in central government, has sunk so low that civil servants prefer to miss targets rather than incur criticism for using consultants.“We don’t expect any immediate increase in demand,” says Simon Rilot at Capita Consulting. “The industry needs to develop a new view of what consulting is.”In the UK, all eyes are turned to the government’s new framework for buying consulting services, which is due to come into effect in the spring. “This is an opportunity to put the relationship between the public sector and the consulting industry on to a healthier footing,” says Alan Leaman, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association.Details have not yet been published, but the larger firms are hoping it will encourage greater use of outcome-based payment methods. “Government clients will be more focused on service delivery, rather than advice,” predicts Mr Shine.That is not much consolation to Mr Johns at Boxwood, who points out that smaller firms do not have the strength of balance sheet to be able to take on unlimited risk-reward work, but equally find it hard to compete as rates fall.“Firms such as Boxwood have a greater proportion of senior consultants. Big firms can use junior staff to keep their average daily rate down,” he says.In fact, the new arrangements, which will come into effect in the middle of 2012, will be two-pronged: a new framework for higher-value projects and a new government emarketplace.The Cabinet Office says: “This change will reduce costs and increase value for money, while opening up the supply market, especially for SMEs. There will be a number of aspects to the framework that make the bidding process easier for SMEs and the whole process less resource-intensive.”All central government departments have signed up to use both the new framework and the emarketplace. The Cabinet Office says that there is a “real acceptance that in order to increase value for money and reduce costs, use of these channels is essential”. The newly formed Government Procurement Service will also publish spending compliance reports that will increase transparency and accountability, it claims.One thing is clear. The new framework and emarketplace are likely to have a big impact on the shape of the consulting industry in the UK – and this will follow the pattern set in other European countries.“It will also force consulting firms to decide whether or not they’re in public sector consulting or not,” says Colm Reilly, head of PA Consulting Group’s government practice.“Those that choose to stay in this market will also have to give some thought to how they resource government work, whether they’ll have big internal teams or choose to work with other, more specialised firms and build solutions as they are needed.”
156;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-11-16T15:16:29Z;Sustainability: ‘Only business can effect needed transformation’;Firms must work with each other and clients to drive change, writes Rod Newing;"Building a sustainable future requires management consultancies to move beyond energy efficiency. They must use their transformational skills to change the way society operates.“Sustainability is the third disruptive change to hit consulting in the past 20 years, after computerisation and globalisation,” says Peter Lacy, managing director for sustainability services at Accenture. “It will become part of everything we do. Just as we no longer talk of ‘e-commerce’, in 10 years we may not be using the word ‘sustainability’.”The global market in 2010 was worth $1bn, according to Sourceforconsulting.com, which provides information about the market for management consulting. This consists of strategy and planning (33 per cent), carbon measurement (32 per cent), renewable energy (10 per cent), energy efficiency (20 per cent) and eradicating waste (5 per cent).This analysis helps to answer the question of whether sustainability projects exist in their own right or are part of every project. The first three areas are pure-play sustainability projects, involving establishing the current situation, assessing alternatives and establishing what actions should be taken. However, energy efficiency and eradicating waste are inextricably linked to efficiency improvement and cost reduction.“Embedding sustainability programmes that deliver both cost savings and efficiencies is the holy grail,” says Andrew Underwood, head of supply chain management at KPMG.“However, economic volatility has put pressure on any initiative that doesn’t have a quick payback. Thorough sustainability initiatives invariably require a longer bedding-in period, so many of these have been put on hold until budgets ease.”The market is being driven by the large corporations. David Metcalfe, chief executive of Verdantix, a firm that carries out sustainable business analysis, says that those with revenues above $1bn account for 95 per cent of the market. However, there is “very little ambition” below £10bn ($16bn), where the focus is on efficiency.Fiona Czerniawska, joint managing director of Sourceforconsulting.com, forecasts that all areas of the market will grow, but strategy and planning and measurement will shrink after two or three years, once organisations have worked out where they are and where to go.Renewable energy will grow for a long time and, with energy prices remaining high, energy efficiency will also continue to grow, she says. However, the fastest-expanding area of the market will be waste reduction, which will increase from 5 per cent to 50 per cent.“Over the next 10 years, we will see a gradual switch from strategy and planning to implementation,” she says. It takes a long time to work out how bad the carbon footprint is and what measures can be taken to reduce it, she adds.Edmond Cunningham, an expert in greening businesses at PA Consulting Group, says pure sustainability consulting ranges from risk mitigation to enhancing positions in sustainability league tables. IBM Global Business Services is finding increasing interest in supplier sustainability, while Ernst & Young’s sustainability projects include reducing risk; tapping new markets and product channels; and acquisition and investment strategies.Accenture is helping to remodel businesses, so they can tap new markets created by the sustainability agenda. Its research shows that 81 per cent of chief executives plan to go after the “sustainability growth agenda” in the next five years.The explosion in sustainability consulting requires large numbers of consultants from a relatively small pool of experience. PwC’s sustainability and climate change team has trebled in size in two years.“The skills range is unlike any other consulting team we operate,” says Malcolm Preston, its global leader. “We have environmental and climate scientists, economists, financiers and specialists in insurance, reporting, behavioural change, supply chain, international development, agriculture, water and carbon trading.”Steve Lang, head of sustainability and clean technology at E&Y, sees the significant growth in the sector as challenging, with increased complexity, more competition and client needs constantly changing.“Everyone is trying to get into the market, which can be confusing,” he says. “It is a good time to be a sustainability consultant, but you need to work hard and bring something different to stand out from the crowd.”According to Verdantix’s latest Green Quadrant Sustainability Business Consulting report, suppliers include strategy, management and environmental consultants, engineering houses, technology services firms, non-governmental organisations, university research teams and niche sustainability, carbon and energy management businesses.Deloitte, E&Y, KPMG and PwC lead the market, with Accenture, Arup, Camco, McKinsey and WSP Environment & Energy also well positioned.We cannot save the human race from climate change just by being more efficient, however. Society must develop new, more sustainable ways of living and doing business, involving huge transformational change.“Transformation is where consultants can add the most value,” says Stuart McLachlan, global managing director of WSP Environment & Energy.“We need to redesign our cities, buildings, infrastructure, products and processes. The diversity of the work to be undertaken precludes ‘one-stop-shop’ consultancy, neither could any client have all the skills in-house. It will require a new culture of collaboration between consultants, and with clients.”Governments, consumers and environmentalists lack the money to drive the necessary change, but business is taking over the sustainability agenda.Mr Metcalfe at Verdantix says only the large corporations – such as IBM’s Smarter Planet, GE’s ecomagination and Hitachi’s Social Innovation – have the money, innovation skills and long-term perspective.“The role of management consultants is really important at present,” he says, “because they have the envisioning skills of how society should function in a more sustainable way and the skills to think about how the market will evolve in five, 10 and 15 years.“These very big corporations need the skill set of the strategy consultants and the energy and environment expertise of the technical consultants.”"
157;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-11-16T15:16:00Z;Ways to profit from ‘new normal’;After improvement in 2010, uncertainty has returned to the market for consulting services;"As they pore over volatile economic forecasts for the years ahead, consulting firms, along with their clients, are seeking an answer to the crucial question: Is there money in the “new normal” and, if so, how and where can it be made?The answer to the first part of the question is a straight “yes”.The recession brought on by the acute financial crisis of 2008 also ushered in one of the toughest years in the sector’s history, as clients – particularly in developed countries – reached for the scissors, to shorten consultants’ mandates, trim costs, or cut or defer contracts.In the UK, for example, 2009 was the first year in which the consulting sector’s revenues shrank.But 2010 marked a comeback, precisely in some of the sectors – notably banking and financial services – that had pulled in their horns in the depths of the crisis.Most of the top 10 global consulting practices showed strong growth in revenues in 2009-10, with PwC, KPMG and McKinsey up 9 or 10 per cent, as shown by figures from Kennedy Consulting Research & Advisory, a US-based industry analysis group.At the same time, the crisis naturally forced changes on the multinational consultancies. They are seeking more revenue from fast-growing economies in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere; refocusing their work on the private sector in countries where government work has become scarcer; and improving the services provided.2010 rankWhat is clear is that there is no scope for complacency and whether consultants prosper or merely tread water will depend on how successfully they answer the second part of the opening question.As recently as June this year, some consultants were hailing a “post-crisis environment”. But as the implications of confusion in the eurozone have spread beyond European borders, it has become clear this was a premature judgment.Meanwhile, external regulation is back on the agenda, thanks to surprisingly radical proposals from Michel Barnier, European internal market commissioner, to ban big audit firms from offering consultancy services.The official line from many consultants is that clients are again planning for expansion.Customers are investing and planning for growth “for the first time since 2008 …even within the context of uncertainty created by the eurozone crisis”, comments Andrew Hooke, chief operating officer of PA Consulting.But the type of mandate available has permanently altered. Paul Gronwall, a senior analyst at Kennedy, says that among consultants and their customers “there is a growing expectation that economic cycles are shortening: the ups and downs are going to happen much quicker, so nobody’s going to put in place a five-year plan, because they’re lucky if they can see a year or two [ahead]”.Alan Leaman, chief executive of the UK’s Management Consultancies Association, draws a comparison between the survey of its members in June 2010, when, despite the grim period they had just endured, they were bright about the future, and the association’s most recent study of firms.“Now,” he says, “the numbers for the first half of 2011 look better than expected, but [members] are feeling a lot more nervous about the next six months.”The uncertainty means the upsurge in demand for advice about how best to cut costs is unlikely to recede.According to a recent survey of UK and global buyers of consultancy services, by Sourceforconsulting.com, nearly 40 per cent expect to spend more on advice about improving their operational efficiency over the next six months.However, the efficiency drive may be combined with an uptick in demand for strategy advice. Raju Patel of Fulcrium, a specialist consultancy, acknowledging, that, in the medium-term, pure strategy is “a shrinking market”, says that “companies that have labelled themselves as strategy organisations have renewed or remodelled themselves and taken on market sectors they would not previously have considered”.But it is usually at economic inflection-points that corporate customers look for strategy advice, often to validate tough decisions they may have to make anyway.The difference in this cycle, industry observers and insiders agree, is that many companies now insist wise strategic counsel must come firmly attached to practical advice about how to implement it.Here, the bigger consultancies, which can offer multiple consulting lines, may seem to have an edge, but as client demands become more complex, some believe the one-stop-shop firms will increasingly find themselves in partnership with specialists.One area where change is slower coming, however, is the way in which consultancies are able to bill for their services. In spite of many firms’ desire to use a value-based fee approach (where firms are paid on the basis of the value created), clients are reluctant to move from more traditional billing models.Consultants say defining what “value” looks like is one obstacle. Even if the trend towards value-based billing accelerates, only a few firms are big enough to put “skin in the game”, in the words of one, and take the risk of failing to pick up a fee at all.Looking ahead, consultants expect 2011-12 to see continued strength in demand from sectors that rebounded from the depths of 2008, particularly those areas, such as financial services or healthcare, where a strong or changing regulatory framework drives business.Sander van’t Noordende, group chief executive of Accenture’s management consulting business, picks out technology and emerging markets as the two biggest drivers of demand.Companies are now grappling with how to apply new technologies in the front office, as well as the back, he says, and asking consultants how best to do it.In markets such as China, India or Brazil, demand is increasingly “multidirectional”, coming from local companies seeking to expand abroad, rather than just multinationals seeking a foothold in a fast-growing region.The consultancy offering itself goes both ways. Accenture has 70,000 employees in India – its largest country – but at the same time, according to Paul Friga, professor at the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School, India-based consultancy firms such as Tata, Infosys or Wipro are “making strong moves into the US, leveraging a new model of global client assistance”.As for Mr Barnier’s commission proposals, unveiled in September, their radical nature came as a shock. If pursued, they may offer opportunities for consultants outside the big four [PwC, KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte] to poach staff. But they may also liberate some of the big audit firms to hunt for customers they are currently unable to approach.Overall, the proposals may not change the competitive shape of European consulting much. “With audit, or without audit, these [big four] would be extremely powerful and high-quality consulting firms,” comments the MCA’s Mr Leaman.The bigger threat in Europe comes from the continuing macroeconomic crisis.If there is doom and gloom in the industry, it is, according to insiders, nothing like the sentiment just before the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008.Consulting firms are clearly now on the front foot. But then, as one consultant points out, “it was four months after Lehman that things got really difficult”."

159;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-11-02T14:26:56Z;Financial services: Banks and regulators at odds;Brooke Masters finds the debate over Basel III and other new rules is heating up;In the months leading up to the Group of 20 nations meeting in Cannes, global banking executives have mounted a furious attack on the Basel III reforms that will force their institutions to hold more capital and liquid assets.They single out the capital surcharge for “global systemically important financial institutions” (GSifis), which is on the agenda for formal endorsement by the G20. It will, they say, hobble already fragile economic growth and force the 28 to 30 largest and most interconnected banks to shrink their lending to the world economy.“There is an acute danger that the pursuit of financial stability imposes too great a cost on economic growth and job creation at a fragile time for the world economy,” Peter Sands, chief executive of Standard Chartered said in September as he unveiled an industry study that emphasised the potential cost of the regulations.Regulators, meanwhile, want the G20 politicians to endorse not only their capital regime but also their plans to force banks to write their own “living wills” that would make it easier to break up or shut down failing institutions.Without a global framework for handling cross-border bank failures, the world economy is still vulnerable to a repeat of the disastrous 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.Lord Turner, chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority, said recently: “We are committed, in the UK and globally, to putting a stop to ‘too big to fail’ status, with resolution tools which can deal smoothly with the failure of a bank however large.”So far, signs point to a G20 endorsement of both the “GSifi” surcharge and the resolution framework, but it is not at all clear what that rhetoric will mean in practice.Recent history suggests that national interests – both in protecting local champions and in wooing overseas business – tend to reassert themselves when the G20 leaders go home.Agreements reached at prior summits on raising bank capital requirements, tying banker pay to risk and taming over-the-counter derivatives, have all become snarled in local issues during the implementation phase.Steve Culp, global managing director of Accenture’s risk management practice, says: “In many ways, the 2009 London G20 marked the high-water point for collaboration across the global political, industry and regulatory agendas.“Since that event, local and national agendas have taken precedence over a common and consistent set of global rules.”While many of the efforts are aimed at furthering the agreements, the actual details often conflict, causing confusion and raising potential costs for the industry.The European Union is drafting laws on bank capital, derivatives trading, credit rating agencies and a host of other measures, while the US is drafting more than 100 rules, many of them on similar subjects, to implement its Dodd-Frank reform law.David Holcombe, specialist in trading at Rule Financial business and technology consultancy, says: “The barrage of reforms and regulations is being applied differently by the various regional and national regulators.“This extraterritoriality is resulting in a disjointed approach to improving transparency and reducing risk across financial services, globally.He adds: “This encourages regulatory arbitrage. The jurisdiction that enforces the first or most negative set of rules will drive participants elsewhere, which in the long term is damaging to any market that needs multiple types of investors with different investment horizons.”Research by Accenture shows that more than 150 pieces of global or domestic financial services regulations are being written right now on top of the US Dodd-Frank process.In some ways, this was only to be expected, given the different national priorities. The US, UK and Switzerland are especially focused on preventing a repeat of the crisis, but other countries have different goals.Tim Kirk, head of financial services at BDO, a consultancy, says: “While global consistency is proving more challenging than governments and regulators may have expected, industry practitioners are much less surprised …“Some governments place different priority on attracting business and being seen as a competitive place to do business as opposed to ever tighter regulatory standards and the higher costs these bring.”The continuing crisis in the eurozone and faltering economies worldwide have also damped enthusiasm for tough reform.Giles Williams, co-head of KPMG’s Regulatory Centre of Excellence in Europe, says: “The recognition that bank lending is crucial to stimulating the global economy is putting significant pressure on the financial stability policy objectives. The politicians face a real conundrum that too much safety could lead to further economic contraction.”Bankers, meanwhile, are rethinking which business lines will still be profitable under the new regimes and are warning that some activities – including lending – could become much more expensive.Patricia Jackson of Ernst & Young, says: “There is no doubt that the combination of higher capital, leverage restrictions and liquidity buffers is putting pressure on the industry.”These pressures are likely to make it hard for the G20 to decide what to do next.With global regulatory groups such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (author of the Basel III reforms) and the Financial Stability Board focused on implementation and ensuring level playing fields and the banking industry struggling to rethink its business models, where should politicians put their energy?Barbara Ridpath, chief executive of the International Centre for Financial Regulation, a think tank, has a partial answer.“It’s critical that G20 leaders recognise the role of securities markets in raising finance for companies to grow, and providing long-term investment returns for investors and savers …They have got to keep their ‘eye on the prize’ of how good regulation can support growth,” she says.Former regulator Clifford Smout, now with Deloitte, has another prediction. He says: “On the whole, discussion has been on the prudential side …It hasn’t really moved on to consider consumer protection.“But if you look at the US, UK and EU, that is clearly part of the issue. That may be a theme that comes to the fore over the long term.” he says.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
161;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-10-18T09:46:00Z;Mike Mordas of Mercer Outsourcing: ‘I see myself as a strategy person’;Stephen Pritchard meets the chief information officer;Mercer, a human resources consulting company, employs 18,000 people in 40 countries.It advises businesses on HR strategy and provides outsourced services, such as pensions, benefits and healthcare administration.These services rely heavily on IT, and Mercer spends 14 per cent of its turnover on technology.Mike Mordas, the chief information officer, started his career at Accenture, the consultancy.But after moving from there to the CIO post at a financial services company and then setting up and selling his own systems integration business at the turn of the millennium, Mr Mordas moved away from technology into training and change management.It was from there that Mercer hired him as CIO.A large part of his job is to use technology to develop the business. But, he says, 10 years away from IT almost means starting from scratch. “I would not say I’m a technologist at all,” he maintains.“The board interviewing me asked me why I wanted to do this job, as I’m not a techie guy.“But the lines are becoming blurred. In a company such as Mercer, we need to be at the forefront of understanding how technology is affecting our clients, changing the competitive landscape, and disrupting some traditional markets.“I see myself as a strategy or business person looking for opportunities to leverage what we do, to enter markets, or to offer levels of service that we have not offered before.”This, he believes, is a significant change from his previous stint as a CIO. “CIOs are now equal members of the executive suite,” he says.“We don’t just talk about machines, wires or software. We are talking about the way the business is developing.”But this does not mean there are no technical challenges.Mercer, for example, has to exchange ever greater quantities of data with its clients, and has just completed a project with Cordys, a software vendor, to improve performance.In that respect, he says, the CIO’s role is to turn vendor-customer relationships into partnerships, as well as to understand how technology developments might affect Mercer’s clients’ business.What has not changed is the importance of solid IT operations. A fine grasp of strategy is of little use, if the CIO cannot execute, Mr Mordas warns.“The foundation of all this is the CIO’s ability to deliver,” he says. “If you cannot deliver, the board won’t believe what you say in your business role.”
162;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-10-14T20:58:43Z;Ski racing? It’s a slippery slope;A weekend of competing in the slalom has Caroline Daniel hooked;"Have you ever watched Olympic skiers and imagined yourself in their ski boots: bombing down a Giant Slalom, taking the gates with casual efficiency, the commentator effusive with praise and a crowd thrilled into applause as you skid to a flurried but controlled stop?Well, in my case the answer was no. Until, that is, I participated in the annual City Ski Championships organised by Momentum Ski, which also runs corporate events and private ski weekends. City Ski is a mini-ski contest for the corporate world combining executives, some of their fastest friends and a smattering of Olympic athletes and celebrities. In other words: not your usual casual ski trip with friends.The event has been held for the past 12 years in the Italian resort of Courmayeur, dominated by the commanding presence of Mont Blanc. The long weekend is geared to those who like their skiing to be competitive and perhaps spiced with a business opportunity. They want a chance to race against rival teams or themselves, beating times recorded the previous year.“I wanted to do something that really pushes me,” says Annabel Fell-Clark, chief executive of Axa Art UK. “I’m not a golfer. I can’t bear that kind of schmoozing. This is much better.”There are bankers, barristers and brokers. Some of the 200-odd attendees were once members of the British ski team; others, like Rupert Atkin, chief executive of an underwriting business, raced at university. Some bring clients. One buttoned-up executive admitted it is the only time of the year she dances.Day one was all about the parallel team slalom, in which groups of four from firms such as Lloyd's of London and Accenture (resplendent in body-hugging suits emblazoned with corporate logo) competed together, while the BBC’s ski commentator Matt Chilton provided banter over the tannoy. (“That’s a Sunday stroll!” was at the tamer end of his repartee.)Day two was the individual race. Unfortunately, that meant me as well. I had skied a little as a teenager in Germany but had not been on the slopes in 20 years. Fortunately, ski coach Warren Smith was on hand for all attendees in need of lessons or racing tips. “When I teach City people, they have the same desire for adrenalin as they get on the trading floor,” says Smith. “I try to channel that into skiing.”Smith, who learnt to ski on a dry slope in Hemel Hempstead after the local BMX park shut down, has coached everyone from Claudia Schiffer to the rugby star Lawrence Dallaglio, whom he taught how to tackle a 45-degree slope. “Beyond that and you are basically free-falling.”Busy doing my own version of free-falling, the last thing I felt ready for was my first slalom on a course covered in ice and with an ominous mist descending (as my doleful eyes saw it). The first man down was Graham Bell, former British Olympic skier, then Colin Jackson, the former Olympic hurdler (who clocked 44 seconds) and former F1 champion Damon Hill (39.44 seconds). Even for them, the competition is compelling enough to keep them returning year after year. Yet the fastest man down was Michael Colyer of Accenture at 30.92 seconds.Amin Momen, the engaging boss of Momentum, gave me no choice. Leaping out of the gate watched by more than 100 people, I found my heart beating improbably fast. My movements could not be called fluent, but I did not fall, and the encouragement at the bottom as you skid past the final gate is addictive. You want to do it again, better.This year the contest is moving from Italy to Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Contestants will get to ski on the World Cup Giant Slalom course but the event will also be expanded to offer more to beginners and even non-skiers. There will be a business forum and a music and comedy festival (with stars including Rufus Hound and the Feeling).At the final night’s gala awards dinner (hosted by comic Marcus Brigstocke), I was awarded “best basic intermediate” – a category created just for me. I got down in 1:39.87 minutes, a mere one minute and four seconds behind the fastest female (Emily Sarsfield, Britain’s number one ski cross athlete). Next year my goal is to cut that gap to a minute.The City Ski Championships 2012 will take place on March 16-18; packages from £665 per person including flights from London (www.momentumskifestival.com).Caroline Daniel flew from London City to Geneva with Swiss (www.swiss.com; returns from £102 including free ski carriage)"
163;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-10-11T17:05:07Z;Setting standards will encourage greater diversity;;"Most companies realise they need to make progress towards better gender balance. The question is how can they best measure that progress.At least two projects – one for multinationals; the other for Australian employers – are looking at how to establish benchmarks that would allow companies and other organisations to evaluate progress against common standards. The Gender Equality Project, launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, is developing what co-founder Nicole Schwab called “a standardised tool…for closing the gender gap”. In Australia, backers are testing the feasibility of Gender Performance Ratings, spurred on by the securities exchange’s latest corporate governance principles, which recommend boards assess annually their progress towards measurable diversity objectives.Rather than threatening to punish failure to achieve certain objectives, both projects aim to provide an incentive for companies to improve policies throughout the organisation – in areas such as pay, recruitment and training – and then to publicise those improvements. For instance, the outline proposal for Gender Performance Ratings suggests making “five-star” awards to Australian organisations that rank highly in an annual survey, with the aim of “influencing corporate culture, staff and board recruitment practices” and “institutional investor behaviour”. Meanwhile, the Gender Equality Project aims to put in place a global gender equality certification system, more details of which should be announced at next January’s WEF.Aniela Unguresan, co-founder of the GEP with Ms Schwab, says investor support is key, but a more important reason for companies to aim for certification is to demonstrate to current and potential staff that they have an edge over peers. The GEP hallmark should help companies recruit and retain talented female and male workers. “Gender equality is just the tip of the iceberg: it’s an expression of the ability of the company to reward more than one leadership and decision-making style,” she says. Jillian Segal, who is working on the GPR initiative, says the “main value” for rated companies would be “attraction of staff, retention of female staff and meeting self-generated targets”.Whereas the GPR project is still at a relatively early stage, the GEP – established as a Swiss foundation – has signed up 11 companies, including Alcatel-Lucent, L’Oreal and Pfizer, for its pilot project. They will come together in Geneva in December to discuss progress and share best practice. The GEP would score companies across five areas of policy and practice – equal pay for equivalent work, recruitment and promotion, training and mentoring, work/life balance and company culture. A combination of an employee survey, statistics, a questionnaire and a qualitative analysis would assess processes and outcomes.Ms Unguresan says all five areas have equal weight. Nellie Borrero, global managing director for inclusion and diversity at Accenture, another of the GEP pilot companies, agrees: “If you don’t get one or two of these right, it will erode the benefit you get with the other three.” Existing efforts to research and monitor corporate gender policies are useful but “certification raises it to a whole new level”, she says. There is a risk of “box-ticking” by companies, Ms Borrero concedes, but the process itself will “help companies raise the bar”.Once the GEP certification system is running, companies will be able to compare how they have done against the aggregated performance of other members of the scheme. Ms Unguresan says she hopes that will encourage adoption of best practice and improvement across the whole group: “Our strategic choice was to set standards for certification that are ambitious,” she says."
164;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-10-11T09:57:52Z;Down on the farm: mobile revolution;;"Forget iPad versus Kindle Fire, the lowly mobile phone still has a lot to do – it could even help deliver a leap in farm incomes during the rest of the decade, according to a report by Accenture and Vodafone.The report looks at 26 countries where Vodafone operates – a disparate group that ranges from the UK to Lesotho. The report claims that mobile technology could deliver an increase in farm incomes of 11 per cent, or $138bn, by the year 2020.Three quarters of that increase, over $100bn, could be generated simply by increasing access to mobile finance – the ability to send and receive money – and improved access to agricultural information. Such simple yet effective gains should not be taken lightly.Emerging market farmers collectively stand to make the biggest gains. But how much is hard to say because the report covers only Vodafone’s operating countries and excludes important agricultural regions – headed by north and south America, Russia, Ukraine and China.The big producers that are covered include India, Australia, New Zealand South Africa, Germany and the UK.So, this is a selective snapshot rather than a scientific study. But its conclusions are probably valid for other countries – among them, other emerging markets.Some 92 per cent of the projected income uplift in the selected 26 states will come from outside Europe and Australasia. However, the ratio of gains per farmer will be smaller as the numbers numbers of farmers in emerging markets in the 26 states dwarves the number of developed world farmers.The ability to transfer money on a mobile phone is nothing very new – such ‘innovations’ have been around for a decade. But the fact that so many people now have access to the technology has suddenly made it that much more useful – and provides a market ready to receive fresh innovations.Fifty three per cent of adult Nigerians, for example, now own a mobile phone. There are 3.5bn mobile connections in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific regions.This chart demonstrates the growth of mobile subscriptions in the developing world over the past decade:So the technology is becoming ubiquitous, with around 70 per cent of people in the developing world now having mobile phone access. But access to financial services is not, with an estimated 2.7bn adults (72 per cent) in developing nations lacking bank accounts in 2010, according to a World Bank Report. This compared to just 160m adults (19 per cent) in developed nations.The Accenture and Vodafone report argues that simply improving farmers’ access to financial services, such as micro-insurance, micro-lending and collective bargaining, could generate an additional $51bn of income by the end of 2020.Kenya’s M-Farm, for example, allows farmers to bargain collectively on their mobile phones to gain access to international markets, secure larger orders and buy bulk inputs at lower prices. More complicated access to supply chains and trading platforms could generate a further $35bn, according to the report.Simple gains like this crop up throughout the report – providing farmers with current information about commodity prices and weather reports could generate another $52bn. This is as simple a process as downloading a ring-tone – farmers pay a monthly, or once-off, fee, register their location and crop-type and then receive alerts specific to their needs including weather forecasts, technical advise, and pricing and subsidy information.This chart sets out the potential gains:However, farmers shouldn’t get too carried away.If averaged out, an 11 per cent increase by 2020 equates to a more modest sounding 1.2 per cent increase each year. While that is still some $15.3bn a year, share it out between hundreds of millions of farmers and it shrinks down quickly.Unfortunately, the report did not outline how many farmers would be affected in each region examined so gauging the actual benefits accruing to each region was impossible.That said, if the technology is as effective as the authors claim, the forecast gains do not require expensive investments and can bring benefits even to families of very modest means.Related reading:

165;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-10-05T23:30:12Z;The future is here;Some of the deals struck in the past year could be seen as pointers to the future of legal services;Compared with other industries, the legal sector was a late adopter of innovations such as information technology and outsourcing. In the past few years, many law firms have tried to improve efficiency using overseas back-office functions and computerised services.Nevertheless, some of the deals struck in the past year could come to be seen as important pointers to the future of legal services provision. The moves by Eversheds and CMS Cameron McKenna to divest key elements of their organisation to trusted third parties could mark a step change.Under the Eversheds deal with Accenture, the consultancy, elements of the firm’s support functions will move to India – not in itself a new idea, but the significance of the arrangement is the extent to which Accenture will play a role in the firm’s accounting, human resources, financial and business processes.Similarly, CMS Cameron McKenna’s 10-year deal with Integreon, the legal and business outsourcer (and supporter of the research for the 2011 FT Innovative Lawyers report), to create a law-firm services platform will provide savings that the firm says will enable it to “engage interested clients in discussions about alternative sourcing methods”.These are radical arrangements because they mean the firms’ partners will bring new models for efficiency and service delivery from their own consulting perspectives to inform management of the legal sector.Barbara Mendler, international operations and projects director at CMS, says: “Lawyers have the skill set to understand whether legal services are provided well, but not if other services are provided well.”More conventional outsourcing has also seen big developments in the past year with the decision of Herbert Smith and Allen & Overy to relocate key services to Belfast.Herbert Smith’s move effectively creates a service operation for one of its departments, while A&O aims to move 8 per cent of its staff – 317 lawyers across all sectors and levels of seniority – to Belfast in four years.Although the moves differ, both take advantage of lower costs and a surfeit of highly educated labour in a nearby and legally compatible jurisdiction.Such “insourcing” has become a theme, as witnessed by Addleshaw Goddard’s establishment of a transaction services team in Manchester, where costs can be kept to a minimum, and Shoosmiths’ establishment of an “onshore service hub”.Hogan Lovells’ technological overhaul of its litigation support department has provided upfront savings that the firm says will preclude the need for outsourcing.While firms continue to look for structural ways of improving efficiency and cutting costs, some older shibboleths – relating to documentary privacy – are also being re-examined.On the surface, Noerr’s development of a tool enabling internal IT outsourcing for insurance groups to be carried out legally has little in common with the appointment of Arthur Cox as the manager of legal services for the Irish Health Service Executive. But they represent significant breakthroughs in the way that electronic information is dealt with to circumvent tricky confidentiality issues.Outsourcing is precarious in the insurance sector because client information is not allowed to be passed on. The health sector, for which Arthur Cox will be acting as an information base across a host of legal service providers, is similarly sensitive.These developments represent an adventurous departure from the legal tradition of eschewing deals where data retention or sharing can create problems. Firms are now looking for ways of creating work while solving issues of confidentiality.The Irish government’s quest for outsourcing public service delivery, which included the HSE deal, stemmed from the sovereign-debt crisis. It is now studying the Arthur Cox model as a template for the future provision of legal services across the state sector.Similar quick-footed ingenuity lay behind the move by Cuatrecasas, Gonçalves Pereira to provide Spanish securitisation funds – another client experiencing the full heat of the economic crisis – with new standard wording for contracts, agreed with Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency.

Although revenue only increased moderately, a higher return on capital allowed the company to boost profitability.Semi stocks have suffered all summer, as data showed companies carrying large inventories, and declining sales of end products, such as personal computers.Citigroup analyst Jim Suva wrote in a client note that “competitors will struggle to match [Jabil’s] results.”and investors appeared to agree with the Philadelphia semiconductor index closing down 2.9 per cent.The wider Wall Street rally evaporated, as hopes of a European deal on sovereign debt again hit a snag, with the European Commission reportedly wading into the argument about whether private banks should take a bigger hit on Greek bonds.The S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent to 1,151.06, shedding half of its gains from Monday and Tuesday’s rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 per cent to 11,010.90, and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 2.2 per cent to 2,491.58.Management consultancy Accenture reported earnings per share of 71 cents for the quarter ended August 31, 2 cents higher than expected, despite falling revenue from its financial and European arms.Shares were up 0.3 per cent to $55.83.But David Koning, analyst at Robert W Baird, warned the recent appreciation in the dollar meant the company could incur foreign exchange losses in 2012.“Further appreciation [of the dollar] could negatively impact revenue and earnings per share,” he added.Materials and energy stocks were hammered on renewed fears for global growth.Amazon shares were up 2.4 per cent to $229.50, after the company unveiled a tablet to compete with Apple’s Ipad.Coal miners Alpha Natural Resources, down 11 per cent to $18.92, and Peabody Energy, off 8 per cent to $35.73, were particularly hard hit.John Bridges, JP Morgan’s coal analyst, said US coal miners faced a dual challenge of a falling metallurgical coal price, and a return to production in Australia, after flooding earlier this year.“When the floods knocked out Aussie production, the Appalachian miners were able to squeeze more of their coal into the higher priced met market. Now they may try and sell this material into the thermal market, and the gap between the two prices is huge,” he said.Cliffs Natural Resources,was off 8.4 per cent to $55.66 after the company announced it would take a $30m hit to earnings, after deciding to idle production at a biomass production facility in Michigan, which has also been put up for sale.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar was down 10.4 per cent to $64.75. Most First Solar revenue comes from Europe, where the weak financial sector is making it difficult for the company to raise finance for new projects.Chesapeake Energy fell 1.4 per cent to $27.27, even after the company reported successful exploratory drilling in its Utica shale field in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The field could yield oil and ethylene, which fetch higher prices than natural gas.All five exchange stocks in the S&P 500 fell after José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, declared his support for a financial transaction tax in Europe, which could hit on-exchange trading.The New York Stock Exchange fell furthest, down 6.3 per cent to $24.01. According to UBS analyst Alex Kramm, the NYSE is the most exposed to Europe of the US exchanges. The planned merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse, which fell 4.6 per cent on the news, also weighed on NYSE.The CME Group, fell 3 per cent to $254.32, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange also fell 3 per cent to $26.35, although the US derivatives exchanges are not significantly exposed to Europe.Nasdaq OMX, whose Nordic cash and derivatives business represents 6 to 7 per cent of revenue, was down 4.3 per cent to $23.99. Mr Kramm said a 30 per cent hit to revenue from the Nordic business would reduce his guidance for Nasdaq’s 2012 earnings per share from $2.83 to $2.58.Intercontinental Exchange fell 2.1 per cent to $121.42. Its European businesses are based in London, which may escape a transaction tax.Family Dollar was off 1.6 per cent to $53.31, despite reporting earnings per share of 66 cents on sales of $2.1bn for the quarter ended August 31, a record for the company.Good results were already priced into the stock, which is one of a handful in the S&P 500 whose share price has risen since market volatility began on July 25.

Collateral management is underdeveloped in many countries, yet their banks have increasing need for the service, according to Jeffrey Tessler, chief executive of Clearstream.He said that since the Cetip deal in June and after Clearstream and ASX, the Australian exchange and clearing group, last month entered exclusive talks about developing collateral management for Australia, he had been contacted by other depositories around the world.“I have not called one of them, they have all called me,” Mr Tessler said in an interview at the Sibos asset servicing conference in Toronto last week. “We want to be able to link all these infrastructures, as they are sitting on all these pools of capital.”Clearstream has forged closer ties with securities depositories in other “Bric” countries, including Russia.Clearstream rival Euroclear is set in November to launch collateral management services in Belgium, France and the Netherlands.
168;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-09-22T07:30:06Z;Regus’ EM office space play;;"Everyone, everywhere is piling into emerging markets and Regus (RGU:LSE), the ready-to-use office space company, knows it.The company is expanding rapidly to take advantage of the new footloose, flexible, working practices it says are the way forward. Since the only way to do that is to have a presence in as many countries as possible, the UK company intends to “get there first” and is “running through a list of countries”, chief executive Mark Dixon told beyondbrics.Regus is pushing ahead quickly – its most recent openings in Croatia and the Ivory Coast brought its global presence up to 90 countries.Dixon intends to open over 800 additional business centers, mostly via joint ventures with local landlords, over the next three years.The next two centers are to be located in Kuwait and Slovenia and the group is eyeing moves into 30 new countries, such as Nepal, Madagascar and Uruguay.The company – whose clients include Google, Starbucks, Nokia, GE, GlaxoSmithKline, Bloomberg and Accenture – has had mixed results over the past two years. It suffered a loss of £6.1m in 2010 before recording a pre-tax profit of £13m ($21m) in the six months to June 2011. However Dixon is confident that his business model is “recession friendly” and points to record occupancy numbers (last recorded at 86 per cent) to support his claim.The company’s aggressive expansion is based on the belief that a “workplace revolution” is underway with demand for “mobile work platforms” set to increase rapidly.Local governments, keen to get Regus into their countries, clearly agree and Dixon said that invitations are not uncommon.Essentially, Regus is hoping that companies, to save money, will opt to rent bespoke space from a centralised source rather than invest directly or rent from diffuse third parties.But whether demand for such facilities will hold up in a more positive, confident, business climate remains to be seen.Related reading:

169;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-09-20T16:02:54Z;Adapting to change: Rapid progress has left banks playing catch-up;;"The world’s financial institutions are paddling in the surf of a digital tsunami that will challenge certainties and fundamentally alter their approach to customers and competition.Three developments in particular – cloud computing, social networking and wireless communication – will play a significant part in reshaping the way banks and brokers do business.Analysts agree that customers should see benefits in better, cheaper and more innovative services. But to some bankers and traders, the changes are not entirely welcome developments.As one observer notes: “[Institutions] will all tell you they are on the front foot in embracing technology but they are all fingering their collars nervously and wondering what the next guy is doing and whether that approach is the one they should go for.”The banks could not have expected to find themselves in this position. In the early days of computing, they led the data processing revolution.They had the financial muscle to install and operate the leading computer systems. Customers were simply recipients of information collected and processed by the banks.Now, the Web 2.0 incarnation of the internet has brought big changes, altering customers’ perspectives and expectations and allowing the entry of new competitors.Jonathan Gray, of the financial services practice at Accenture, the consultancy, says digital channels have become the “hot” area for financial institutions. “Probably the biggest change we have seen this time round is the change in customer expectations and maturity. The research we have done shows that customers are much more ready to purchase goods and carry out transactions over digital channels – especially the online channel.”However, financial institutions, still reeling from the crises of the past few years, seem to have different priorities.Research by Temenos, the banking software group, indicates that regulation is the biggest challenge facing banks today, followed by customer retention and competition – especially from new entrants.Ben Robinson, director of strategic planning at Temenos, says: “In an era of depressed margins, banks are worried about losing their best customers to competitors who can serve them better, and their remaining customers to competitors who can serve them more cheaply”.Today’s IT developments are a double-edged sword. They can provide ways of dealing with regulation while providing customers with better and cheaper services; but they also allow non-banks to compete in some areas of the market.Stuart Drew, specialist in financial services at HCL, the software house, says a gap has opened between financial services institutions and the market.He points out that while the number of customers using mobile banking and related services is expected to rise from 55m in 2009 to 894m in 2015, it was recently revealed that 60 per cent of financial services organisations in Europe ban social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter in the workplace and 40 per cent do not have a social networking policy.J.P. Rangaswami, formerly chief information officer at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the investment bank, and now chief scientist at Salesforce.com, the cloud computing company, believes the key for the banks is to understand how to engage more with their customers.“The answer is simple – by going where the customer is.“The past 50 or 60 years have been spent making scale and distribution efficient but at the cost of innovation and moving further from the customer.”But the biggest challenge, according to Accenture’s Mr Gray is that of integration.“How do [financial institutions] bring [social media] inside the organisation and make it part of a seamless customer experience,” he asks."
170;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-09-20T16:02:54Z;Customer profiles: To find meaning in data is more art than science;;Banks are swimming in a sea of data.With the global banking industry handling trillions of transactions a day – all but a small minority processed by computer – they have built up enormous stores of information.According to a study by McKinsey, the management consultants, the banking and security and investment industries generate more data per employee than any other industry.But as the subprime mortgage crisis and global downturn showed, availability of data does not automatically translate into better intelligence.Although banks own some of the largest data warehouses and supercomputers in private hands, the industry’s ability to spot negative trends has not been impressiveEven now, as regulatory pressures mount, some struggle to form a clear picture of their customers, or their own exposure to market risks.“There are two angles to this [problem],” says Edwin van der Ouderaa, global head of financial services analytics at Accenture.“One is the IT angle. Banks have a lot of data, but it’s in many places, shapes and forms, so it is hard to build a clear picture. Most banks and insurers have spent the past 10 years trying to integrate their data warehouses, and haven’t got very far.”The second, he says, is this: “Capital is scarce and banks need to know where to deploy it.”“They need to drip feed their capital. Many banks think that they are successful but are, in fact, selling the wrong product to the wrong customers.“The customer is buying products too cheap, and the bank is taking on a worse risk than it thought.”The consequences of this became all too clear during the subprime crisis, suggests Martha Bennett, vice-president at Freeform Dynamics, an industry analyst.Banks simply did not know which customers could pay back their loans, and which were at risk of default – even though they had most of the necessary information.“Banks have lots of data in disjointed systems,” says Ms Bennett.“The bank your mortgage is with might be unaware of your credit cards or savings. If the bank stops receiving your salary, what has happened?“Have you lost your job, or changed banks? If your outgoings are still with the bank, it’s likely that you have lost your job.”Third-party data services, she says, have now started to model the likelihood a mortgage holder will default, based on public data.Banks are starting to use these services to help spot repayment problems early on.But the move to such data “mash-ups”, which combine public information with banks’ own data, can be hampered by the banks’ IT architecture.In both retail and investment banking, IT is typically organised around products, rather than customers.This makes it hard to form a clear idea of the riskiness of customers.According to Ms Bennett, some banks took regulatory changes, especially the Basel II regulation regime, as a cue to move to new IT platforms that are better at combining data.These banks now find themselves at a competitive advantage – they are better able to maximise profits and control risk.“Risk-based pricing is not original or novel,” cautions Andy Whitton, a partner at Deloitte.“But banks are doing this in more sophisticated ways, identifying and assessing the risk of customers, and doing it with more data.“What has changed in technology is the accessibility of the data.“A lot of the data sets are now more accessible than previously – it would have been a project in its own right before to connect the data.“But there is also a recognition among senior management that data are an asset.”Accessible information is just one sway of improving profits and regulatory performance.Banks need to convert what they learn from their data into action – information is of little use if banks lack the flexibility to launch products, or management reacts too slowly to warning signs on risk.“Banks have collected terabytes or petabytes of data over the last five to 10 years,” says Rasmus Wegener, a data management expert at Bain & Co, the consultancy.“Having enough data today is not the issue. The issue is what to do with it …It is more art than science to derive meaningful insights.”The best banks, he says, have cleaned up their data, connected them, and put together multi­disciplinary teams that combine data analytics experts and businesspeople to interpret the information.With regulators demanding ever more detail about banks’ risks, that investment will have to continue. “But the majority are not quite there yet,” Mr Wegener says.
171;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-08-14T15:42:03Z;Cognizant shines in Indian IT sector;;Francisco D’Souza, the chief executive of Cognizant Technology Solutions, exudes confidence at a time of heightened global uncertainty and as most Indian information technology companies are underperforming expectations.The 42-year-old is not one for bragging, but is fully aware that the group he helped found is considered IT’s rising star by most sector analysts.The Nasdaq-listed group, headquartered in the US but which operates predominantly from India, saw revenue grow 40 per cent in 2010 and expects 32 per cent growth in sales this year to $6.06bn. That compares with 2011-12 growth estimates for the entire sector of about 15 per cent, according to Nasscom, the body representing the $70bn-plus Indian IT industry.In the last quarter, Cognizant, which was spun off from US business intelligence group Dun & Bradstreet in 1996, overtook Wipro to become India’s third-largest software exporter by sales. Industry experts expect the fast-growing group to eventually surpass number two Infosys and challenge the dominance of Tata Consultancy Services, the sector’s top player with revenues of about $8bn.Mr D’Souza tells the Financial Times that the secret to the company’s success has been its positioning in the IT market as partly low-cost Indian IT outsourcer and partly high-end western consultancy.“Clients had two views of the market,” says Mr D’Souza. “[They] viewed Indian companies on one side as being very good for low-end mechanical work, and they viewed [consultancy] companies as having higher-end skills: deeper industry knowledge, better onsite project management and the ability to drive change.”Cognizant tried to position themselves in the middle to differentiate their offering, he says.TCS, Infosys and Wipro are facing stiff competition from companies such as Accenture, IBM and Capgemini and are battling above-inflation increases in wages that could eventually erode their cost benefits. Jitters in developed markets – where most of the IT companies’ clients are based – also remain a matter of concern.To keep growing, Cognizant came up with its own “secret sauce”, as Mr D’Souza puts it. The group has focused on investing more than its peers on innovation – resulting in generating lower margins – and deepening its relationships with existing clients.“We made a decision to set operating margins at a target level of 19 to 20 per cent, lower than our key offshore competitors, to give us the room to reinvest everything above that into the business,” says Mr D’Souza.Its other strength has been that about 90 per cent of its annual growth comes from existing clients.Cognizant began offering simple back-office services. Today it spends most of its money on developing high-end IT services, as well as working closely with its clients to build a presence on social networks.Analysts say its success comes from its focus on developing ideas to help companies boost revenues rather than on cutting costs.“Cognizant prepared better to grow faster in the pack,” says Sudin Apte, principal IT analyst at Offshore Insights. “The company [also] took a bold step and increased its spend in a tough economy on activities such as R&D and innovation, account management, building new offerings and solutions, and continued recruiting at senior and middle management level when arguably many others cut their budgets.”
172;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-08-10T19:23:56Z;Apple spikes Free Music Download app after label complaint;;Apple has removed a top-selling music downloading application from its App Store after complaints from record labels that it could facilitate copyright infringement.The literally titled “Free Music Download” was published in mid-July by Hong Kong-based Zentertain. Available in both free and “pro” versions, the latter costing around 99c/69p, the app had topped the App Store download charts in the US, UK and 17 other countries.Described by its creator Kai Xia as a cross between Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player, the app enabled users to browse to a music file on any site, download it and play it offline through the app.“We don’t really understand why these two kinds of software suddenly specifically aid illegal music downloading,” Mr Xia told the FT.But many of the app’s reviews noted that by visiting unlicensed music downloading sites such as MP3Skull.com, large quantities of music could be downloaded for, well, free.This attracted the attention of the BPI, which represents record labels in the UK.“BPI has examined the ‘Free Music Download’ app available on the Apple Store,” the trade body said earlier this week. “It is clear that much of the music which can be downloaded is unlicensed, so we have contacted Apple to set out our concerns.”On Wednesday, the app disappeared from the App Store. Apple, which vets all iOS apps before release and takes a 30 per cent cut from every sale, declined to comment.Mr Xia – who previously worked at Accenture, according to his LinkedIn profile page – told the FT on Tuesday that he had reached out to music labels to “address their copyright concerns” but nonetheless defended his product.“From our understanding, today is an age of free,” Mr Xia said via e-mail. “Only because something is free doesn’t mean it’s illegal. Nowadays there have been more artists and websites devoted to distributing free music, such as Jamendo… We believe that free will be the next biggest business model. We want to help free legit music find its audience. And we want users to find great free legit music. That’s why we developed the app.”Mr Xia argues that visiting sites such as MP3Skull on any web browser allows users to download tracks for free. That’s true for PCs but not for the iPhone, where Apple’s Safari allows for in-browser streaming but not downloading to a media player.As such, Apple may well have seen Free Music Download as a threat to its own iTunes music store.This is not the first time Apple has approved an app which rightsholders have had concerns about. Grooveshark, for instance, was removed from the App Store last year after a complaint from Universal Music, which has been engaged in legal action against the popular music-streaming service.But allowing Free Music Download to linger in the App Store for several weeks may raise eyebrows among other media companies. Many are still smarting after Apple last month moved to enforce its new rules against linking to content stores beyond the reach of its 30 per cent commission.
173;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-08-02T21:49:21Z;A business that began as a joke;;Parma, the foodie Italian town in Emilia Romagna, famed for its prosciutto ham and Parmesan cheese, is one of the best examples of how Italian entrepreneurs have turned the fruits of their daily lives into successful businesses.Parmalat, the multinational dairy company, was founded here. Barilla, the pasta maker, is located just up the road. So are Ferrari and Max Mara. The region is one of the richest in the country.Yet on one of Parma’s cobbled streets in a converted convent is a very different business from the usual “Made in Italy” cliché of food, fashion and fast cars. Here you will find Buongiorno, a mobile internet company, which does business with 130 telecoms operators in 57 countries.With the iMac computers and jugs of freshly squeezed orange juice on their boardroom table, company founder Mauro Del Rio, chief executive Andrea Casalini and the multi­lingual team of engineers could be in Silicon Valley. Except that above them there are 17th-century frescoes on the vaulted ceilings.Mr Casalini, who like many of the company’s core management team hails from Parma or the nearby area, calls it “the perfect mix of back to roots and internationalism”.“There is something good about the energy and about how the way we work supports the wellness of the environment,” says the 49-year-old, kicking back in a sleek modern chair.Buongiorno’s traditional business is based on a monthly fee paid by telecoms operators in return for the Italian company’s efforts to push content including ringtones, games and graphics to 9m users of traditional mobile “feature” phones.It also has a business-to-consumer mobile marketing unit and an online gaming development business. With the advent of cloud computing and smartphones, its main challenge is developing mobile payment systems and cloud applications. In 2010, 90 per cent of its €253m revenues came from outside Italy. A close competitor is Motricity in the US.But it did not start this way. The seeds of the business and its name (“good morning” in Italian) were sown in 1995 when Mr Del Rio, who was then working at Accenture but wanted to work for himself, had the idea of sending a joke via e-mail and then by text to 12 of his friends for them to enjoy when they woke up.By the end of 1998, Mr Del Rio was sending his e-mail to 25,000 people in Italy. By the end of April 1999, he had 50,000 subscribers. No longer limited to jokes, Mr Del Rio was sending listings of music, cinema times, shop openings, classical concerts and sports events.The first shot of seed investment equal to €120,000 came in late 1999 after word spread among friends at Accenture and from the Parma area. Mr Casalini was among the first investors, and soon became employee number two.Mr Del Rio raised a further €4m in February 2000 with an increase in share capital. Again, local entrepreneurs from Parma and surrounding cities in Emilia Romagna took part. This time, funding came from some of the region’s most famous family groups including Barilla, the Maramotti family behind Max Mara and Chiesa pharmaceuticals.By the end of 2000, Buongiorno had offices in London, Paris and Madrid with 10 people in each of them. It now employs more than 1,000 people.Recounting these early years, the 47-year-old Mr Del Rio says that “going to 25,000 [subscribers] so quickly almost provoked a family crisis” because of the strain on his personal resources.But unusually for an Italian entrepreneur, many of whom remain provincial and private in order to keep control within the family, he has pursued a global strategy and a listing through organic growth and key acquisitions in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, the US, China and Japan. He now spends much of his time travelling between Parma and New Delhi following a deal with IBM in IndiaThe turning point came in 2003 when Buongiorno listed on the Milan stock exchange as a result of a reverse takeover of Italian user-generated music aggregator Vitaminic, a pioneer of online music downloading. Mr Del Rio held on to only a 20 per cent stake. “From the beginning, I wanted to be international and part of something bigger,” he says. Buongiorno’s most recent acquisition was in June when it bought out European rival Dada.net.Both Mr Del Rio and Mr Casalini agree that the relationship between the founders has been one of “the greatest ingredients of success”.While Mr Del Rio and Mr Casalini met as adults, some of the core management team were old friends. “We all worked long hours from the beginning but some of these are relationships that go back to school. This creates an intimate relationship but we’ve also been very careful to maintain a highly professional position in everything we do,” says Mr Casalini. “From very early on we did formal performance reviews, for example.”…The quality of life offered by the company has also helped attract bright graduates. In Italy, keeping talented graduates has an extra significance: the fuga dei cervelli – brain drain – has become hard to stem in the past decade as Italy’s economic growth has stagnated and a ruling gerontocracy has left little room for ambitious youth. It is partly for this reason that supranational organisations such as the International Monetary Fund have said tech start-ups are vital to Italy’s economic future.Mr Casalini says Buongiorno has tried to offer a flexibility that is unusual in Italian companies. It recently opened an office in Shoreditch, London, and has been sending engineers from Parma who want to go. A married couple who worked in Parma and decided they wanted to move to Australia were given the task of setting up Buongiorno there.Nonetheless, being in Italy has had its downside. Mr Casalini’s upbeat demeanour vanishes for a moment. “We haven’t got a lot of interest from the financial markets in the past couple of years. We don’t think the market is recognising the value of the company. We hope that people will see the value in the longer term.”It is a common complaint from Italy’s small and medium-sized enterprises. Mr Casalini argues that cost cuts at investment banks have hit European small- and mid-caps as banks have cut back staffing.Mediobanca, a Milanese bank, recently noted that Buongiorno shares were trading at almost a 50 per cent discount compared with peers with similar business that are listed on bigger exchanges.But while delisting from the Milan bourse has became a trend among many Italian small and midsized companies that have found the rewards of listing offset by the costs of quarterly reporting, Mr Del Rio dismisses the idea with a familiar refrain: “I always wanted to be part of something that was bigger.”
174;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-07-17T15:26:24Z;TCS head upbeat amid challenging market;;N. Chandrasekaran is in an upbeat mood as he relaxes on a leather sofa in his office overlooking the lush, monsoon-soaked grass of the Azad Maidan in south Mumbai. The head of Tata Consultancy Services, India’s largest IT outsourcing group by market capitalisation, has just delivered a forecast-beating set of quarterly results.Just days after rival Infosys warned the volatile global economy could slow client spending, TCS last week announced a 31 per cent jump in first-quarter net profit to $532m on revenue of $2.4bn. The IT outsourcer said it expected to see steady demand for its services by being “agile” and “entrepreneurial”.Mr Chandrasekaran says constant talk of the state of the global economy misses the point. Coming out of the financial crisis, customers are increasingly demanding a more tailor-made service. “Customers have a plan . . . if we don’t align to that plan there is no business,” he says.TCS – whose clients span a wide range of sectors and include companies such as British Airways and Sony – recorded growth of 6-15 per cent across all regions. Expansion has been broad based, and “all the major markets are in double-digit growth,” says Mr Chandrasekaran.Part of TCS’s recent strategy has involved expanding into fast-growing emerging economies. By establishing a presence in countries such as Brazil and Mexico, TCS can service existing international clients as well as local companies going global. It aims to increase emerging markets revenue to 30 per cent in the next five years, from 17 per cent now.Growth could also come through acquisitions. TCS has a war chest of about $2bn earmarked for buying rivals in markets such as Europe and Japan, says Mr Chandrasekaran, though attractive targets are scarce. “The problem is not the price but whether it’s a strategic fit,” he says.Yet as TCS looks positively ahead, analysts remain unsure about the outlook for the sector at a time when growth is slowing at Infosys, India’s second-largest outsourcer.Nasscom, the Indian IT outsourcing industry body, predicts revenue from the sector will rise at least 15 per cent to about $70bn in the year to March 2012.But analysts point to key areas of concern. TCS, Infosys and number three Wipro face stiff competition from companies such as Accenture, IBM and Capgemini and analysts say above-inflation increases in wages could eventually erode the cost benefits of outsourcing to India.Mr Chandrasekaran insists Indian IT outsourcers remain competitive. This financial year TCS aims to take on about 60,000 people, on a par with last year. And while Mr Chandrasekaran admits staff turnover is high across the industry, he says TCS is having no problem hiring.Deploying those staff overseas has, however, become an issue of increasingly hot debate after the US last year raised the cost of applying for business visas from $320 to $2,000. The move came amid pressure on the Obama administration to protect jobs at home.CLSA recently downgraded the Indian IT outsourcing sector to “underweight”, citing the visa issue as a factor. With rejection rates in the US currently running at almost 40 per cent, up from 5 per cent 18 months ago, CLSA sees “the visa issue fundamentally altering the business model for Indian techs”.Mr Chandrasekaran admits that any time a company has to spend money, “it hurts”. But, he says, the visa issue is “a single factor in the whole value chain” and the key is to “work the business model around it”.
175;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-07-15T21:08:18Z;Star-crossed;Once universally revered, the Michelin Guide is now dismissed by some as a relic of a bygone age;"In the Paris banlieue of Boulogne-Billancourt, in an unprepossessing dark stone building, a French institution has a new address. The Guide Michelin had for decades been headquartered in the ultra-smart 7th arrondissement. But a few months ago, it packed up and moved out of Avenue de Breteuil, one of the most elegant streets in Paris, with its lawns, lime trees and direct view of the golden dome of the Hôtel des Invalides.On the short walk from the Metro station to the new suburban office, I saw a small boy urinating in the street amid piles of rubbish, in the shadows of several grim-looking blocks of flats. It may have been unfortunate timing but it was difficult not to feel sympathy for the staff of the venerable “red book” – which remains, after more than a century of handing out and taking away good food stars, the arbiter of gastronomic excellence in France and beyond.One person who won’t be visiting this new address is Jean-Luc Naret, who quit as director of the Guide Michelin in December. It’s almost impossible to imagine this flamboyant globetrotter making the trip every morning across the Parisian “frontier” of the périphérique ring road.Naret himself says that his former co-workers at the world’s oldest restaurant guide are “not happy” about the relocation. In his first interview since leaving the publisher, he says he understands the necessity of the belt-tightening imposed by senior managers at Michelin, the tyre-maker that owns the loss-making guide. But he stresses that “obviously nobody is happy to leave a beautiful building in the 7th and to move outside Paris”.Indeed it is in the smart centre of Paris that the company’s secretive network of restaurant inspectors typically operates, sampling the fastidious, some say fussy, food associated with Michelin stars. Many food critics grumble that this heavily stylised cuisine is outmoded. François Simon of Le Figaro, France’s most feared food critic, says: “For me it is something from another century. It goes back to a time when everybody was obeying the rules and the bourgeoisie. But today things are so different, that approach is really over.” He adds that “every time they make an award it doesn’t mean anything to me. I say, well, that’s interesting from a marketing point of view, but that’s it. Today people consider the table a place where they want to feel at ease, to be self-indulgent, to have sexy people, to have good food, life and interesting things. But not these very serious dishes and all those boring things. Each time I see a Michelin star in a small town I say, well, that’s a boring place, and it always is.”Nevertheless, the award of Michelin stars can add up to 30 per cent to takings, according to restaurant owners. The wealth just isn’t shared by the Guide Michelin, which is haemorrhaging more than €15m annually. Accenture, the consultancy firm, was brought in last year and issued a dire warning: the company needed to change rapidly or risk becoming a ­forgotten relic in the digital age. A year later, Michelin is still pondering what to do. And seven months after Naret’s departure, it has yet to announce a new editorial director.…Michelin & Co was founded in 1889 by brothers André and Edouard Michelin, in the Auvergne region of central France. In 1900, the first Michelin guide was launched when it was handed out to chauffeurs of some of the 3,500 cars then on the road in France.The company remained a staunchly family affair into the 21st century. But adding to current anxiety surrounding the “red book” is the fact that an outsider, Jean-Dominique Senard, is about to take the helm of the parent company for the first time. There are murmurs about the family’s displeasure with the tougher financial line being proposed for the guides, though their influence is not what it once was.For Naret and others it is inevitable that Senard, a finance man to boot, could not share the family’s strength of feeling about the guide, which has been the recipient of unquestioned largesse in recognition of the publicity it brings to what one insider describes as a “boring old tyre company”, but also in recognition of the fierce protectiveness shown by the family toward their gastronomic “jewel”.“There’s an awful lot of pride amongst the Michelin family,” says Peter Harden of the eponymous UK restaurant guide. “The red book ­transformed them into a pillar of the French community at a cultural level rather than merely an industrial one.”The Michelin insider agrees, saying the guide, which is bought by more than 1 million people in its various international guises each year, “is bigger than any person, it’s a national treasure”.But some wonder whether the management team running the tyre company has the same devotion to culinary excellence as the younger Edouard Michelin, the last holder of the famous surname to run the firm. Great-grandson and namesake of the co-founder, Edouard drowned in a fishing accident off the coast of Brittany in 2006 at the age of 42.For Naret, who was recruited by Edouard after decades working in the hotel industry, this tragedy has fundamentally altered the relationship between the tyre company and the guide. “There is no Edouard Michelin any more,” he says. “His secret dream, he told me many times, was that he wanted to be an inspector … he was really passionate about food, passionate about restaurants, we used to talk about gastronomy all the time.“Obviously now we don’t have anyone with the same spirit and at the same time the guide was carrying his name on the cover, which is obviously not the case any more,” adds Naret. “I would imagine there is a change taking place; developments that were brought in have stopped. A ­magazine we launched called Etoile, a beautiful magazine, was stopped.”For its part, the current Michelin management team insists that fears about its stewardship of the guides are overcooked. Senard and Michel Rollier – the current boss of the tyre firm and a Michelin family cousin – fully appreciate the marketing “genius” behind André and Edouard Michelin’s 111-year-old idea, it says.“One of the biggest assets of Michelin is the brand, so it is key,” says Claire Dorland-Clauzel, the Michelin executive in charge of international branding. “It is not a question of the financial background of Mr Rollier or Mr Senard [both former finance directors] or other things. They are both not only financial, they have an industrial background also and they have a global view. They are very careful about the brand. Without the brand, Michelin group is what? I can tell you that finances are not the only drivers for these two men.”Naret and others also concede that Rollier should be applauded for turning round the fortunes of the parent company during his time in charge, carrying on a restructuring started by Edouard and instilling a sense of fiscal discipline.Nevertheless, there has been a clear change in attitude towards the guide over the past few years, which some say helps explain the departure of Naret – even though he insists that he always intended to leave at the end of last year and had even considered leaving after the death of Edouard before being persuaded to stay by Rollier.According to a person who knows the ­company well, there was a feeling that while the big-spending Naret had done a fine job expanding the guides into new international markets such as New York and Tokyo, he was a bit too “bling” for the stuffier types in Clermont-Ferrand, the tyre company’s home city in the Auvergne.“Jean-Luc was different from the old Michelin inspectors,” the person says. “He was glamorous and international, a bit of a playboy even in his style of dress, so he was absolutely the opposite of the traditional approach of discretion above all things. But he did a great job, I think. First of all he internationalised the guide, and he also modernised it, opened it up to the world. He loved to talk, he had an enormous ego, he liked to be in the papers, but he was fun and sympathique too. But he was so over everything, so often in the papers, that I think it started to bother the top guys.”…There are rumours that Michelin’s new choice of editorial director is somebody from Clermont-Ferrand, possibly even someone from a tyre factory. To put a “tyre man” in charge of the famous old guide books would be a pretty remarkable change from Naret, who will take the reins of a luxury hotel group in Mauritius in August.Michelin declines to comment on the identity of the replacement, saying that an announcement will be made in the next few weeks. It also defends the seven-month delay by arguing that it needed first to complete a bigger restructuring of the non-tyre businesses. It merged the company’s guides and maps business with its digital travel assistance division, a decision that it says also explains the move to the new suburban premises, where they will all be under one roof.Michelin stresses though that when taken together, the maps, guides and digital businesses are profitable. But the losses incurred by the red books have become such a concern that Michelin has turned to outside consultants. Accenture looked last year at three different scenarios for the red books, including outright closure.The nuclear option was quickly rejected, partly in recognition of the undoubted brand value of the guide but also because of the political impossibility in France of such drastic action. However, Accenture warned that to carry on with things as they are today would mean yearly losses at the guide hitting €19m by 2015, representing a cumulative loss of €70m over the next four years.As a result, the consultants proposed a new business plan that would allow Michelin to make money by offering online “services” to the hotels and restaurants included in the guides.The thinking seems to be that Michelin would do well to seek a share of the good fortune that its awards bestow on restaurants, possibly by creating a “red book” website that provides paid-for links for those establishments with Michelin stars and allows users to make online reservations.The danger of such an approach is if it threatens the cherished independence of Michelin’s inspector system, particularly if restaurants without stars are allowed to buy into the online service – one suggestion made by consultants. Michelin has always made great play of the fact that there is no charge for entry in its pages, which means that it retains credibility.While it appears happy to take on the chin the constant stream of criticism from Parisian food critics like Simon who say its innate conservatism has turned French cuisine into a museum piece – or the suggestion that its inspectors are awed by big-name chefs such as Gordon Ramsay and Alain Ducasse– it is much more sensitive when anyone questions its propriety.And Michelin has been burnt in the past after it put out a favourable review of a Belgian restaurant even though it was shown later to have not yet opened. A tell-all book by a disgruntled inspector in 2004 alleged that his former colleagues, who work incognito, sometimes play favourites with chefs and do not always visit reviewed restaurants as often as they say. (Michelin inspectors, of whom there are 90 worldwide, visit each premises once every 18 months – more frequently if the quality of food is seen to be improving or worsening.)Dorland-Clauzel, the Michelin executive, indicates that the possibility of offering services may be considered, though it is too early to say how this might work. But she insists that “the independence and autonomy of how we select restaurants is going to continue, it is key. We will not compromise this … People think we are honest and they trust that.”The big problem for Michelin, as for all publishing companies, is how to make money from the internet as younger people shun their heavy guide books and flock instead to online sites such as ­toptable.com with their constantly updated, user-generated reviews. While Michelin has developed an app for the iPhone, the guide itself has a limited online presence – found by trawling through ViaMichelin.com, a complicated travel itinerary service.For Naret this failure to create a “beautiful” red book website is a source of great frustration. “The internet was one of my biggest battles over the last seven years,” he says. “I remember before I left in December having the same conversation about it with the same people who were in charge seven years ago and they still didn’t understand what the Michelin guide was all about. Obviously something is wrong there.”In response, Dorland-Clauzel acknowledges that “we have to move, for sure, but we have started to do that”. Harden also defends his rival, admitting that “if you look at all of the brands that have authority offline, none of us has really discovered a brilliant online business model, because nothing really works with all that free stuff out there”.Better news for devotees of the red book’s star-system is found in a separate internal study carried out for those now running the company, who wanted to know just how much all that Guide Michelin publicity was worth to the bread and butter business of selling tyres. The study shows that the presence of Guide Michelin in a country means people are up to 3 per cent more likely to buy its tyres. With €5bn of tyre sales in the first three months of this year alone, these are figures to be taken seriously. Certainly, defenders of the faith are eager to stress the huge amount of “buzz” every time a guide is launched or Michelin starts covering a new city.“When we launched in Tokyo, there were 150 people at the press conference, and 12 hours of prime-time TV and interviews,” says Naret. “That was really very clever in front of Bridgestone [a big tyre-making rival] in their home town, and this is the basic idea behind the guide going back to when it was launched more than 100 years ago.”While the company has been forced to close the Guide Michelin in Austria, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, the belief remains that new books could help it crack crucial tyre markets such as China and Brazil.One thing, however, is certain. Whatever changes are decided upon by Senard as he gradually takes control, he will want to make sure that the cherished red book does not become a rallying point for disgruntled Michelin family members.Dorland-Clauzel claims that the family now owns only about 3 per cent of Michelin, though some industry analysts believe this is closer to 10 per cent and she declines to say how many of the voting rights they control. “A lot of people think it is a family-owned company, but it is not at all, not for a long time. It is in terms of values, which are very strong and important, but not in terms of ownership.”Nevertheless, given the Guide Michelin’s heritage in France and the cultural and political clout it bestows on those bearing the name, it would be foolish to ignore their views entirely. For now the family is keeping its counsel, but the person who knows the company well says “everybody has heard that they are not happy [about the more financial approach] … I think they [the Michelins] still love the guide. What industrial company has such a powerful communications tool? I’m not sure such a thing exists.”James Boxell is the FT’s Paris correspondentTo comment on this article, please e-mail magazineletters@ft.com……………………………………………………………..Reach for the stars the story of the ‘Guide Michelin’1900The first edition of the Guide Michelin, with a distinctive bright red cover, is published by Michelin, writes Victoria Beale. Its primary purpose was to promote travel and tourism by car. It gave practical advice on where to find mechanics and oil, as well as where to stay and eat.1920In an effort to increase its prestige, the Guide is no longer distributed for free. The reason given for this is the possibly apocryphal story that André Michelin saw a stockist using a stack of copies to prop up a table leg.1926The Michelin system of star ratings is introduced, in which outstanding restaurants are marked with a single star. In 1933 two and three stars began to be used. Three stars meant that a restaurant’s food was some of the best in the country and was worthy of a journey in itself.1945The 1945 Guide Michelin reflects the state of a country damaged by war and still under rationing. Stars were suspended and rather more grim notifications took their place. Travellers were informed whether a hotel or restaurant was now “destroyed”, “damaged” or “requisitioned”.1952Time magazine declares the guide to be “the tourist’s bible”.1966The first recorded casualty of Michelin’s influence on the high-end restaurant industry – chef Alain Zick commits suicide after his restaurant loses one of its two Michelin stars.1997The “Bib Gourmand” restaurant category is introduced, honouring establishments which offer both good food and value for money.1999Marco Pierre White declares that he is “giving back” his three Michelin stars. Since there were no physical stars or award to give back, Marco had to content himself with attacking the ethos of the guides, accusing them of valuing “formality” over “charm”.2003Bernard Loiseau, chef at La Côte d’Or, kills himself, apparently partly from fear of losing his third Michelin star.2005The first New York edition of the guide is published. Four restaurants were awarded three stars.2007150 Tokyo restaurants, reviewed for the first time by Michelin, are awarded a record 191 stars between them.2008Juliane Caspar is the first woman to edit the guide. In order to maintain her anonymity she only allows photographs of the back of her head to be taken and never gives face-to-face interviews."

The company has raised $15m gross, with $4m paid in cash on closing and the remainder in deferred payments, dependent on the sales performance of the acquired assets. The full payment will be made by the end of 2015.Nokia has been shedding non-core businesses as it prepares for the release of its first smartphones based on Microsoft’s Windows software. It recently outsourced the development and support of Symbian, which used to be its principal operating system, to Accenture, allowing Nokia to shed 2,800 employees. A further 250 Nokia employees and contractors will move across to Synchronica as part of the deal.Nokia acquired its operator-branded messaging business in 2008, shortly after the launch of the Ovi suite of services, which is in the process of being rebranded.Synchronica almost quadrupled its revenues in the first quarter of 2011 to $1.9m compared to the same period the previous year, and swung to a pre-tax profit of $0.8m from losses of $2.3m.“We are very excited to add this dramatic market share in North America to our strong market share in emerging economies,” said Carsten Brinkschulte, Synchronica’s chief executive. The company, which is based in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, has around 80 carrier contracts in regions such as Latin America but the monthly payments per user from operators – which can range between 10 cents and $1 – are higher in developed markets, such as the US.More than 80 per cent of the revenues from the acquired business are paid on a recurring basis rather than a single upfront licence, compared with 23 per cent for Synchronica’s existing business.

to $77.93.These gains helped the S&P 500 index put on 1.3 per cent to 1,296.67 in a low volume session, adding to the 0.9 per cent rise on Monday.The 2.2 per cent bounce in the S&P so far this week comes after nearly two straight months of losses on the index, prompting some commentators to argue that US equities may have found their bottom.“The markets may retest the lows of last week, but I think we have reached a bottom and the worst of the declines are over,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The “risk-on” trade dominated in the session, leading the materials, energy and technology sectors sharply higher along with the consumer discretionaries.The technology sector was helped by a number of ratings upgrades, leaving the sector up 1.3 per cent.LinkedIn, the business focused social networking site, was up 11.2 per cent to $84.91 after a raft of banks put “buy” and “outperform” ratings on the stock as they began coverage following its initial public offering last month.Monster Worldwide added 9.9 per cent to $14.91, also lifted by a number of positive analysts reports.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Microsoft put on 2.4 per cent $25.80, adding to the 3.7 per cent gained in the previous session, as the company unveiled an online version of its Office software suite.The S&P energy sector was the best performing on Wall Street, rising 2.7 per cent as Schlumberger was up 4.6 per cent to $84.32 while Halliburton put on 5.3 per cent to $48.70.Among the materials stocks to gain were Freeport-McMoRan, which added 3.6 per cent to $50.45 and Cliff Natural Resources, which climbed 2.1 per cent to $89.21. The S&P materials index was up 1.8 per cent, benefiting from a rise in commodity prices.These gains helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 1.2 per cent to 12,188.69 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite add 1.5 per cent to 2,729.31.Overall sentiment was also helped by hopes that the Greek parliament would vote to approve some key austerity measures on Wednesday.Economic data from the session was mixed. The Case-Shiller index recorded a rare monthly rise in home prices in April on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting that the pace of decline in house prices may have abated somewhat.But the index was down 4 per cent from the previous year and it was not clear how much of the gain was due to recent higher temperatures. “It is much too early to tell if this is a turning point or simply due to some warmer weather,” said the report from Case-Shiller.Still, the S&P homebuilding index up 1.2 per cent in the session and Pulte group , the largest US housebuilder by sales, added 2.7 per cent to $7.89.In other economic news, data from the conference board found that US consumer confidence had fallen in June to its lowest since November 2010.The Vix volatility index, which is also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 5.4 per cent to 19.45 in the session, as traders turned more optimistic.In corporate news, Accenture gained 3.2 per cent to $59.66 after Standard & Poor’s said the consulting company would replace Marshall & Ilsley in the S&P 500 index next month when the regional bank’s takeover by Bank of Montreal is expected to close."
178;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-06-22T16:09:40Z;Head of NHS IT programme resigns;;Christine Connelly, the head of the NHS’s troubled £11bn IT programme, has resigned, leaving the programme with an interim head at a time of critical contract negotiations with its biggest supplier, CSC.Ms Connelly, who has been the department of health’s chief information officer for almost three years, said she was going because the reorganisation the department is undergoing as part of big cuts in NHS administration means there will be fewer director general posts and she had decided not to apply for one.Katie Davis, a former partner at Accenture who also had a senior government IT role and has recently been working in the Cabinet Office efficiency and reform group, is to take over on an interim basis.Ms Connelly’s departure comes as the NHS IT programme has been subjected to a major Cabinet Office review the results of which have yet to be announced.It may result in CSC being asked to open up its contract – which covers two-thirds of England – to other software suppliers after repeated delays in getting its Lorenzo record software up and working.David Cameron, prime minister, has said “all options” are open, including cancelling “all or part” of CSC’s deal after the National Audit Office said that the plan to give all 55m patients in England and electronic record “will not be realised” by the existing contracts.Ms Connelly’s departure comes as an already long delayed information strategy for the NHS, needed to pull together patient records and provide more information for patient and commissioner choice of services, has been put off yet again until the autumn as the government revises its NHS plans.

180;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-05-29T23:13:22Z;India’s entrepreneurial road ignored;;Everyone in India is a businessman, from the roadside stall owner selling snacks, to the country’s corporate elite such as the billionaire magnate Mukesh Ambani. In fact, the country is said to have the highest number of entrepreneurs in the world.But only a small percentage of these businessmen and women are leading the country’s growth through innovation and new ideas on a big scale. The majority of India’s traders work in privately run businesses and their number, in a population of 1.2bn people, is difficult to estimate.Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) were established to create a pool of the best and brightest individuals who would foster development, creating a growth story for India that would include every individual from the top to the bottom of the pyramid. But even among graduates of these schools, arguably the most qualified and best placed in society to become entrepreneurs, few go on to do so.Although some former students such as Tapangshu Das do opt for the entrepreneurial route, such examples are few and far between. The reality is that more than 90 per cent of graduates at IIMs prefer to take secure, well-paid jobs at international companies such as Accenture and Goldman Sachs, or domestic corporations such as Hindustan Unilever after finishing their postgraduate programme in management – the PGP – often likened to a Masters of Business Administration in India.But John Sculley, a former president of PepsiCo and former chief executive of Apple, says that if India is to grow, it needs to embrace its entrepreneurial spirit in order to innovate.“When it comes to innovation, there is a huge gap. You can trace it to the fact that India is very strong with the left brain, which is about frugal engineering, execution, adapting to processes, for example, where it has built a huge reputation.He told journalists at a leadership summit in Mumbai, organised by the information technology lobby Nasscom that “innovation takes both right and left brain thinking, and the right brain is about taking risk”. Risk-taking is not part of the culture of India, he added.Bakul Dholakia, director of the Adani Institute of Infrastructure Management and former director of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad (IIMA), echoes Mr Sculley’s views.He says: “In Indian culture, in your early 20s, your parents still play a very important role in your lifeand have a huge influence on key decisions. When I was director at IIMA I really did try to encourage entrepreneurship, but it wasn’t the students that didn’t want to take the risk. It was their parents who objected and questioned why their sons and daughters would want to give up a good job and the security of a certain type of lifestyle and salary that goes with it. They do not want their children to have to struggle.”Moreover, securing a coveted place at one of the 11 highly competitive IIMs involves considerable amounts of time, effort and money and many parents would rather their offspring opted for a foot on the relatively secure corporate ladder, than embark on an entrepreneurial venture.To encourage entrepreneurship, Prof Dholakia introduced a policy change at IIMA in 2006. If students embarked upon an entrepreneurial route that after a year was unsuccessful, they would be eligible for placements at big-name corporations for the two years after graduation.“Parents really welcomed this, as they wanted something for their children to fall back on. But hardly any of these students came back [for the placement],” he adds.Age is also a factor. B.H. Jajoo, dean at IIMA, says that the average age of an IIM graduate is 24. However, globally, most entrepreneurs do not consider their own entrepreneurial venture until the age of 28.“Remember that MBA students in India really are less experienced than their counterparts abroad. They tend to complete all of their education first, and then start work. They would rather use those few years after graduation to gain some on-the-ground training.”A lot of students are also deterred because “an unsuccessful venture takes away prime time for career building”, says Prof Jajoo. Failure at such a venture could result in two or three years of lost time in which a student could have moved up the corporate ladder significantly, he adds.At IIMA more than 90 per cent of graduates accept offers from domestic and international companies, with nearly 60 per cent accepting jobs in finance or consulting. These ratios are typical across all IIMs.However, the climate may be changing. The government-backed IIMs are trying to cultivate entrepreneurship to provide more chances to those Indians willing to take that leap of faith.The IIMs at Bangalore, Calcutta, Lucknow and Kozhikode all have centres for entrepreneurship and the Indian School of Business at Hyderabad has a compulsory course in entrepreneurship as part of its PGP.IIMA offers a number of entrepreneurship courses alongside seed funding from private equity groups, incubation labs, finance training and a mentoring system to support fledgling entrepreneurs. But such opportunities are only available to a few people.“We take around four or five companies on a year [into the incubator], some from IIMA and some from outside,” says Prof Jajoo.…To date, IIMA has taken on about 25 companies. Of IIMA’s 9,000-strong alumni, about 10 per cent have set up or are running their own businesses. “Every year around 15 to 20 students will go into business,” adds Prof Jajoo. About 300 chief executives of professionally run organisations in India are IIMA alumni, he says. Prof Jajoo is keen to emphasise the role of private equity funding in fostering entrepreneurship.“This funding for postgraduate ventures is picking up. As the economy grows and consumption increases, there is a greater demand for new technology. This is providing fertile ground for innovation particularly in India,” he says.
181;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Product design: Customisation means much more than a local language manual;;"For manufacturers, pleasing customers and shareholders means making products people want – and doing so profitably.A successful product takes account of local preferences and the needs of specific customers. But a profitable product is one that allows its maker to achieve economies of scale, typically by centralising manufacturing.But customising products for different markets is no longer a matter of printing a local language manual and putting different stickers in the box. Companies need to add features for wealthier markets, and simplify products for others. They also want to use as many common parts and processes as possible.Car makers once designed and built entirely different models for markets such as South America, China, and the US. Today, they have global design teams that collaborate to produce base models – or “platforms” – that are remarkably similar in manufacturing terms, even if they look and perform very differently.The idea of standardised platforms is now finding favour in other industries too, from mobile phones to aircraft manufacture.According to Gartner, the market research firm, the need to win share in new markets, while containing or reducing costs is driving companies towards standardised designs that still allow for customisation. Businesses that succeed can increase the number of products brought to market by 70 per cent and reduce development costs by about a third.“Manufacturers want as much commonality as possible to keep costs down, but also flexibility in sourcing,” explains Marc Halpern of Gartner. “If you are sourcing parts from different suppliers, you want to optimise that as well.“You might introduce variants to a design because certain parts that meet certain specifications may not be readily available, and the manufacturer has figured out it costs more to ship standard parts than make a modification to the design to accommodate local suppliers.”Manufacturers are turning to tools from computer-aided design and engineering to product life cycle management software and applications to manage bills of materials and component sourcing. They are especially keen to invest in technologies that help them manage variants of their core products, to maximise the reuse of components, and to make the most of tried and tested production techniques.Global product development is also forcing companies to look beyond e-mail and Excel spreadsheets, to electronic visualisation and design tools that support collaboration. Microsoft’s SharePoint and video conferencing are being pressed into service.“A lot of the IT tools we use – visualisation, solid modelling, 3D drawing and electronic overlays – are pretty standard,” says Rob Gayson, vice-president for global operations and quality at Psion, the handheld computing devices maker.He adds: “Our differentiator in this market is that a lot of companies we compete with, have products that are designed for purpose. We design to a platform, which can then be extended to serve different purposes.”Another challenge for manufacturers is satisfying increasingly sophisticated consumer desires.The trend towards built-to-order manufacturing started with companies such as Dell, but the car industry is now its greatest proponent.According to Georg Gradl, manager for manufacturing industries at SAP, BMW – an SAP customer – has so many options and variations for its best-selling 3 series model that no two cars sold in a year are identical.Supporting a wider range of variations requires closer collaboration between designers, engineers and marketing and sales departments, and a move away from linear, and often paper-based, product development.“Among manufacturers, the idea of doing everything in one place and then shipping it out is long gone,” says Kenneth Taormina, global managing director for engineering at Accenture. “You design in different locations; you don’t always have the intellectual talent where you want it. Manufacturers now also want to tap talent in markets such as India and China.”"
182;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-05-17T12:45:52Z;Factory automation: Capable old machines with incapable old software;;Factory automation has progressed a long way from the days when perforated paper tapes managed the operation of individual numerically-controlled machine tools on the shop floor.Once computers took over from tape, the stage was set for running banks of machines and then entire factories from one central control point.But the process is by no means finished. As companies have established operations round the world and product ranges have expanded, the task of managing the production process has become ever more complex. Getting manufacturing management systems to work more closely with broader enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems has become the new challenge.“Market forces are driving companies to a broader interpretation of automation,” says Alberto Proverbio, senior executive in the products group of Accenture, the consulting business. “It has to be integrated with IT systems to meet the need for greater transparency in plant operations and to improve the visibility of costs and other key performance indicators.”Factory automation consists of three interlocking layers of computerised controls, according to Ralf Dreischmeier, senior partner and head of IT in Europe at Boston Consulting Group.The first consists of the technology that is built into the production machinery. Then, comes the manufacturing execution system (MES) that controls the entire manufacturing process across all sites. Finally, there is the ERP layer that manages a wide range of business processes.“Traditionally, MES was deployed on a plant-by-plant basis, with every factory having its own system to optimise manufacturing,” Mr Dreischmeier explains. “But MES needs to be standardised across sites to get the maximum benefit.“The same happened with ERP,” he adds. “Many companies ended up with as many as 20 systems across multiple sites. They need to move to just one or two to maximise the benefits of standardisation and minimise the running costs of the technology.”Incompatible factory automation systems are often the product of takeovers or mergers. “You have to decide how best to optimise that situation,” says Mr Dreischmeier. “It is a question of how much value you can create by replacing one with the other, versus the effort, the cost and the risk involved.“Plant managers in different countries might want different things. Finding the common denominator without jeopardising local flexibility is the biggest challenge.”A problem that is most acute in manufacturing, where a factory may have fully depreciated machinery that is still working well after 20 years, is that the software running the machines may be outdated and incapable of being integrated into a business-wide automation system. Once again, managers must decide whether production runs are worth disrupting to modernise the machinery.“Twenty to 30 years ago, factory automation relied on closed systems that used proprietary software, but the move to open standards has allowed these systems to interface with the rest of the world,” says Peter Terwiesch, chief technology office at ABB, a supplier of process automation systems. The company’s flagship control system, the 800xA, connects to ERP and maintenance systems.A focus of development work is the integration of energy management systems with factory management software. As the cost of energy has risen, managing its use in real time has come to play an important role in reducing costs. “In many industries, the energy bill is more than the company’s Ebit [earnings before interest and tax],” says Mr Terwiesch.“Without control systems, most companies could not make products in a way that made good use of their assets: the raw materials and energy. Productivity is the main imperative, but these systems help companies do the complex calculations needed so that products meet their ‘spec’ and comply with environmental regulations.”Early factory automation systems would typically measure and monitor the performance of a single machine with a wire running into a central control point. Modern digital systems can transmit hundreds of measurement signals to a central control in real time.Some processes – in, for example, the chemical industry – might involve very slow changes. But paper production, where sensors can measure the thickness of paper down to one-10th of the diameter of a human hair at production speeds of up to 100 kilometres an hour, requires systems that can respond very quickly to any changes.Modern systems are equipped with microprocessors that show if the sensor itself is functioning efficiently. As well as monitoring, say, the running temperature of a piece of machinery, it will show whether the sensor itself has been contaminated with the material being processed and warn the operator that it needs cleaning.“Digital technology cuts down on the cost of installation and it also helps you look after your assets better by providing predictive and preventive information,” says Mr Terwiesch.

Conventionally five “golden” metrics are used to measure manufacturing performance: total cost, total cycle time, delivery performance, quality, and safety.“Six sigma” – the management business strategy designed to cut waste, promote efficiency and improve customer satisfaction – is increasingly being used by manufacturing organisations to reach consumers more rapidly. The strategy acquired its name from a measure of quality, as defined by freedom from defects.Sergio Colella, head of the global industrial equipment practice at Accenture, the consulting business, says chief executives are placing ever greater demands on chief information officers, in pursuit of this goal.He says, “more and more CEOs are asking their CIOs to manage three things in corporate IT: first, cost efficiency; second, service quality, which can be determined by service level agreements; and, third, a contribution to the productivity of the business through, for example, a reduction in “time to volume” – the time between initiating a new product and reliable, high capacity production – or “time to customer”.Mr Colella believes that IT, measured by key performance indicators (KPIs), should be able to underpin the efficiency of manufacturing, as it moves to new regions or experiences volatility in supply and demand.“IT should be able to scale up or down quickly,” he says. “It should have the flexibility to support mergers or acquisitions and it should be able to integrate new functions such as business intelligence”.Manufacturers are increasingly using the comparatively new metric, “overall equipment effectiveness” (OEE), a term that originated from Toyota’s lean manufacturing initiatives. It is an umbrella term for a number of KPIs that, in combination, measure overall availability of manufacturing capability, together with performance and quality ratings.Engelbert Wimmer, head of manufacturing for PA Consulting, says the kind of questions these metrics should address include: “What is our scheduling system and our bottleneck management? How do our suppliers perform and how are they integrated? What is our use of energy and how can we improve maintenance, both planned and unplanned.”He says there are five priorities when designing a manufacturing system that is properly aligned with a company’s IT.First, international standards are essential. “Many plants are still using home-grown tools, processes and techniques,” he says, “with home-grown IT around them. This is not what modern IT systems should look like. You need international standards, so you can create a quality-control system and roll in forecasting and supply chain management. The mantra must be: ‘What are our standards and our connections outside the organisation?’”.Second, it is important to crack open the silos, the islands of non-communication within the company. “IT has to be an integration technology. There must be open lines of communication, so that everybody is clear that IT is working for the manufacturing side.”Third, and this follows from the second priority, it is important to “make business matter”, so that IT is informed and knowledgeable about possibilities and problems on the production line. IT must not be allowed to operate in a “nerds’ basement”.Fourth, IT must offer a professional service to its manufacturing customers via service-level agreements. “I don’t want know how long the server is up – I want to know how long the manufacturing line is up” should be the attitude. Is there a disaster recovery plan in place, if, for example, a forklift truck severs a communications cable?Fifth, a business-value team bringing all these approaches together should be established. “In a well run manufacturing environment, the IT dashboard would have a lot of traffic lights derived from the business and the CIO would have a good understanding of how to support the business side,” Mr Wimmer says.However, as Mr Wimmer jokes: “It was easy for God to make the world in seven days, because there was nothing before.” In some ways, this encapsulates the problems of established manufacturing sites worldwide.Simon Allsop of Dassault Systèmes, an IT services group specialising in 3D software, says that in the final analysis, profit, turnover and quality are the governing factors in any manufacturing operation, but that the demands of “time to volume” and “time to customer” mean companies increasingly want to short-circuit the time taken to establish a robust, productive line.Dassault’s software enables the company to simulate manufacturing operations in three dimensions before a single production line station is built. In the aerospace industry, (the field of Dassault’s parent), it may take the production of 30 or 40 aircraft before the line achieves stability.Using visualisation to model the process, the number can be reduced to as few as five.Mr Allsop comments: “3D is much easier to understand than 2D. Simulation will save a manufacturer a lot of time and money”."

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
186;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-05-11T18:56:18Z;NHS patients record project faces cull;;Ministers are considering cancelling all or part of the biggest single contract in the NHS’s £11bn project to create an electronic patients record, David Cameron has revealed.The move would in effect put an end to the programme in its current form.Of the original big four suppliers, only BT, which is responsible for London and a few hospitals in the south, would remain.The prime minister’s disclosure that “all options” were on the table in CSC’s £3bn deal to install systems across the north, midlands and east of England came after the US-owned company missed more deadlines to get its Lorenzo patient record software working – and as a key NHS partner walked away.Richard Bacon, a Conser­vative member of the Commons public accounts committee, told Mr Cameron that the programme, which is years behind schedule, would “never deliver its early promise” of a record for all 50m patients in ­England.Of the £11.4bn budget, some £4.7bn is still unspent, he said, and, rather than “squander” it, a better way had to be found to spend it.Mr Cameron said the government was “absolutely determined to achieve better value for money”. No refresher of the contract with CSC will be signed until after a National Audit Office report on the programme next week, followed by hearings of the public accounts committee and a wholesale review by the projects authority set up by the Cabinet Office.“All the available options under the current contract” will be examined, he said, “including the option of terminating some of, or indeed all of, the contract”.Christine Connelly, the health department’s head of IT, warned in April last year that CSC was on the brink of being fired after it missed repeated deadlines to get the software working in a big acute hospital.Other deadlines have since been missed and last month a mental health trust walked away from the programme in frustration, making it impossible for CSC to hit the latest set of contractual terms to qualify for a large payment and a contract adjustment.CSC took over from Accenture when it walked away in 2006 after hundreds of millions of pounds of losses. In 2008 the NHS fired Fujitsu for underperformance, with the health dep­art­ment and the company still locked in litigation over that decision.
187;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-05-08T22:11:36Z;Insurance for groups to restore reputations;;The full costs of a tarnished reputation are impossible to calculate, but a clutch of the world’s largest companies are about to be offered insurance that will help pay for the advertising, lobbying and public relations that could help restore one.Aon, one of the world’s biggest insurance brokers, has teamed up with WPP, the world’s biggest marketing services group, and Zurich Financial Services, a leading insurer, to create a policy that will pay out up to $100m for an annual premium of about $5m.Global brands such as BP, Sony, Rolls-Royce, Qantas, Toyota and Accenture have all had high-profile reputational issues to deal with in the past couple of years, each with a different primary cause and wildly differing costs.Their travails underline why reputational risk scores so highly on surveys of board-level concerns.BP is thought to have spent in the region of $300m on advertising, lobbying and PR since the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico, which sounds like a large sum until compared with the $20bn clean-up and compensation liabilities it faces.BP declined to comment on its ad spend. At the other end of the scale, Accenture had quickly to recreate all its advertising materials when it decided to drop Tiger Woods as a celebrity endorser in the wake of his personal fall from grace in late 2009.However, its full-year report for 2010 shows the company spent less on advertising overall that year than in the previous two. Aon, WPP and Zurich launched their $100m brand restoration cover last week and are initially focusing sales efforts on about 30 of the world’s biggest companies that are already clients of Aon and WPP.These include companies such as Dell, ExxonMobil, Ford, Bayer, Volkswagen, British Airways and Tesco, though the policy could subsequently be offered more widely.There have been a handful of past attempts to market reputation-related insurance, such as Chartis offering a small “spin-doctor cover” add-on to its directors’ and officers’ insurance.However, this is the first time an insurer has brought a media company into a policy and offered such a large policy limit. Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of WPP, who has been involved in the development of the product, said crisis communications were a key area for WPP clients. WPP will act as a kind of loss adjuster for the policy, advising on and directing spending for a crisis-hit company for the first few months up to a limit of about $25m.
188;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-05-05T08:39:35Z;Comment: ‘Algo bots’ could cause another flash crash;High speed traders are still rewarded at the expense of safety;"It has been a year since the infamous “flash crash” exposed serious flaws in the stock market. Last year on May 6, steady and controlled selling gave way to a dangerous and precipitous plunge, as computerised proprietary traders – high frequency traders – tripped over each other to see who could sell the fastest.The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,000 points in a few minutes, with losses totaling nearly $1,000bn, while stocks like Accenture traded down to a penny per share and Apple Computer traded up to $100,000. Then, after a brief halt in the futures market, computerised algorithmic robots – “algo-bots” – that were panic selling only a few minutes earlier next started a buying frenzy, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed itself as quickly as it first collapsed.The world’s biggest and most important stock market had briefly gone insane, and that evening stock exchanges tried to clean up the wreckage by busting the tens of thousands of trades that were 60 per cent or more away from pre-crash prices.A few days later, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced a blue ribbon advisory committee and its first order of business was to investigate what soon became known as the flash crash.Detailed SEC and CFTC staff reports to the committee told what happened. With the market already spooked by a financial crisis in Greece, and in the face of heavy selling, many high frequency market makers – firms the stock exchanges pay to provide liquidity to the market, to buy and sell from the public – turned their algo-bots off and disappeared. In our recently deregulated markets, that was perfectly legal.As prices continued to fall, firms that stayed open for business tried to control risk by immediately selling whatever they bought, even at lower and lower prices. These firms ended up mainly buying and selling to each other, driving prices down at each step in a spiraling panic SEC and CFTC staff called “hot potato” trading. That was also perfectly legal.While some firms played hot potato with each other inside the stock exchanges, other firms played hot potato with the stock exchanges themselves. “Internalisers” are dealers that match customer orders on their own, outside of the stock exchanges.On May 6, internalisers chose which orders to keep and which orders were too hot to handle. As the market plunged, internalisers kept buy orders to themselves and sold short against them hoping to profit as stocks continued to fall. Internalisers flipped customer sell orders to the stock exchanges, though, driving prices even lower. Eventually hundreds of stocks traded down to pennies a share. That was perfectly legal too.The committee studied the flash crash for nine months and issued its conclusions and 14 regulatory reform proposals in February.Several of the committee’s proposals expand or refine volatility firebreaks already in place; the SEC recently announced it will act on at least some of these. Another set of proposals highlights the SEC’s recent risk control rules for previously unsupervised firms, and encourages both the SEC and CFTC to supervise computer trading algorithms more closely. The last group of its proposals speaks to exchange fees, modest market maker obligations, order routing practices, and more order book information for market participants.Three recommendations from the last group are particularly promising. We detail them here, but wonder if they will ever make it to the rule-making phase, given the intense lobbying in Washington to prevent it.First, the committee said high frequency traders should pay for their high-speed antics, perhaps as a small order cancellation fee. In today’s markets, it doesn’t cost anything to submit and cancel orders, so these firms send and cancel millions every day, looking for the tiniest advantage. Over 90 per cent of their orders get cancelled nearly instantaneously. They claim that this activity is necessary for their risk management, and that we all benefit as a market because it allows these firms to give us tighter spreads. It distorts market prices, though, and can be predatory in nature. At best it delivers fleeting liquidity while imposing huge technology costs on the industry as a whole.Second, the committee also recommended that regulators reform internalisers. Though regulators have fretted about internalisers for decades, the committee’s imprimatur is the muscle regulators need to overhaul this segment of the stock market. On May 6 internalisers played a large role in causing volatile price swings. Requiring internalisers to keep at least some portion of their customer orders during volatile periods will relieve stress on markets.Finally, the committee recommended expanding regulations to always guarantee investors the best available price, regardless of which exchange has it. This “trade-at” rule protects the public’s orders at every price, on all exchange order books.The committee’s most important point, though, boils down to 18 words: “Even in the absence of extraordinary market events, limit order books can quickly empty and prices can crash.” They tell of how profoundly our recently deregulated stock markets have changed, and of how stock exchanges can’t seem to control even their own order books any more.In other words, the flash crash can happen again. Last year, former US senator Ted Kaufman coined the term “mini flash crash” to describe an unexplained price crash in a single stock. Though they don’t reach the scale of May 6, mini flash crashes are a common enough rehearsal. They happen almost every day.We will be vulnerable until we learn that deep, liquid and fair markets will never result from unrestrained and unregulated high-speed algo-bots. While circuit breakers and volatility bands will mitigate some risk, the core problems of our market structure still exist and remain unaddressed.We still have deregulated for-profit exchanges that encourage and reward volume-generating high speed traders, even at the expense of safety, rationality and economic growth. We still have conflicts of interest in a system where, ideally, there should be none. And we still cling to the false notion that all of the trade volume algo-bots generate, looking to skim a half-penny or two as quickly as they can, is good for investors.Joseph Saluzzi and Sal L.

189;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-05-01T21:58:26Z;Whitehall cuts consultancy bill by a third;;The era of lavish government spending on management consultants has come to an end, with fees earned by advisers to the public sector falling sharply last year.According to figures by the Management Consultancies Association, earnings from government fell by about a third in 2010, forcing the industry to reshape its business to cope with the biggest shift in consultancy demand in 15 years.The research is the first to show a year-on-year fall in government spending on professional fees across the entire public sector. Although Whitehall cut spending on management consultants by 8 per cent in 2009, it was offset by a 35 per cent increase by local authorities and other government-funded agencies.The findings were welcomed by the government, which had pledged to cut its consultancy bill amid growing public unease about the billions of pounds spent on professional fees in the past decade.Spending on external advisers had grown sharply under the Blair government as services were privatised and expensive projects rolled out.Figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats before the election last May showed that the three biggest suppliers – Accenture, Deloitte and PwC – alone billed the government £1.4bn in fees in the past five years.Francis Maude, Cabinet Office minister, is a vociferous opponent of consultants and has imposed strict constraints since taking office. Several large projects, such as the identity cards programme, which racked up millions of pounds in professional services fees, have been cancelled and the government is in the middle of overhauling the way it procures external advisers.The changes – expected to come into force by the end of the year – will centralise the process so that almost all contracts are issued by a branch of the Cabinet Office. That ought to provide greater transparency on spending as well as giving small and medium-sized firms a better chance of winning mandates, the Cabinet Office said.The government said the changes showed its determination to cut costs at the centre, rather than at the frontline. It will also give internal staff more opportunities after previous investigations found that consultants were hired before it had been established whether in-house employees had the skills for the job.“The use of consultants previously has been both wasteful and demoralising for mainstream civil servants who feel marginalised and who would welcome the opportunity to expand their experience and skill base,” the Cabinet Office said.“The freeze has meant we have not only saved money but also given civil servants the opportunity to undertake new roles and deepen their own skills.”Alan Leaman, chief executive of the MCA, said it was working with the government to improve value for money. “It’s a different era. There won’t be the same demand for those sorts of big projects.“There will be a need for work that brings cost savings, higher productivity and public services closer to citizens. But it’s a different sort of job and it will be a much smaller market for consultancies.”In spite of the cuts in government spending, the consulting industry returned to growth in 2010 as an increase in private sector work offset the decline in government mandates, the MCA said, writes Gill Plimmer.Private sector fee income increased by 10 per cent – the fastest rate of growth since 2007. Total fee income of MCA companies, representing 70 per cent of the industry, rose 1 per cent on 2009 to £5.4bn.Most of the increase has been driven by financial services companies seeking advice on restructuring, cutting costs and adapting to regulatory changes introduced after the financial crisis.Fee income from banks grew by 35 per cent last year, just under the record 40 per cent rise achieved in 2006.IT mandates also surged 9 per cent, even though companies shunned large-scale technology projects, the MCA said.Over the past decade the big consultancies made about twice the fees from advising central and local government than they did from financial services, the most lucrative industry in the private sector, some estimates say.But with the dynamics of the market changing, professional services firms have been redeploying employees from government practices to projects for private companies. Almost all FTSE 100 members employ external advisers in a total market worth £8.1bn last year. With the UK near saturated, consultancies have been expanding overseas, opening new offices in the Middle East and Asia, with about 10 per cent of fee income on average earned by UK-based consultants working in other countries. The MCA said consultancies still provided value for money, earning clients £6 for every pound spent.
190;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-04-29T18:38:27Z;Salaries criticised at state-owned CDC;;Ministers have attacked “inflated remuneration” at CDC group, the state-owned investor in emerging markets, after it emerged that senior managers are almost four times better paid than counterparts at development finance institutions.An independent report commissioned by Andrew Mitchell, international development secretary, found that the £366,000 pay for CDC managing directors was 281 per cent higher than the mean at similar state-backed development groups. The Accenture study, seen by the Financial Times, also shows the £500,000 combined salary and bonus for Richard Laing, the departing CDC chief executive, was more than double the mean for chief executives in a sample of 16 similar groups and funds.The findings will provide ammunition for Mr Mitchell as he presses ahead with a shake-up of CDC to temper executive pay and refocus its strategy away from low-risk, high-return investments.“CDC’s current pay deal has led to inflated salaries,” Mr Mitchell said. “We must bring pay and bonuses down to a level that is fair and appropriate, but not excessive, for a publicly owned body whose very purpose is to reduce poverty.”Founded in 1948 as the Colonial Development Corporation, CDC invests in 143 funds backing businesses ranging from Indian beauty products and Nigerian oilfields to an Egyptian bank and a leading budget hotel group in China.After a management overhaul in 2004, CDC made a priority of financial performance, offering incentives to prove, partly to other investors, that sustainable returns were possible in difficult emerging markets. Its portfolio grew from about £1bn to a £2.8bn fund of funds, becoming one of the world’s biggest investors in emerging market private equity funds.In agreement with the then Labour-run Department for International Development, CDC benchmarked its pay against other City funds-of-funds, on the basis that it operated in a similar fashion and recruited from the same pool of talent. This assumption is to be overturned by Mr Mitchell’s team, who argue that these funds are rarely involved in development finance and provide the wrong baseline for setting pay.Accenture, the management consultancy, found CDC stood out from a sample of 16 development finance and emerging market funds primarily because of its reliance on bonuses. Among CDC managers, only the earnings of “senior support professionals” were close to the median.Mr Mitchell argues that CDC has “lost its way”, becoming a financial institution at the expense of its “development DNA”. His plan is to reset its mission and repopulate its ranks with successful City veterans and young talent driven by idealism.A new chief executive will be appointed, a role that Mr Mitchell described as “one of the most attractive and worthwhile jobs anywhere in the financial world.“Working at CDC is going to be incredibly interesting, exciting and worthwhile. I will agree with CDC’s board how to restructure pay to attract, motivate and retain people with the attitude and skills necessary,” Mr Mitchell said.A new strategy will empower CDC to make direct investments in poor countries with a broader range of financial tools, such as debt, direct investments or equity. Over time, the fund of funds model is expected to account for about half of CDC work.The danger from working in more risky, difficult countries is that CDC profitability – which has returned 11 per cent to shareholders over the past five years – will go into reverse.“Profitability really matters. It matters for CDC as an institution too,” Mr Laing wrote in the CDC annual report this week. “Our own profitability means that we have not had any new money from government for over 15 years. We’re self-sustaining and that’s important in the present economic climate.”
191;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-04-27T17:24:37Z;Nokia to cut handset workforce;;Nokia is cutting the workforce at its handset business by 7,000, or 12 per cent, following its landmark decision in February to attempt a fightback in the smartphone market by using Microsoft’s software.About 4,000 Nokia employees face redundancy and a further 3,000 are due to transfer to Accenture, the consulting and technology services group, under an outsourcing deal.Nokia has struggled to produce smartphones to match Apple’s iPhone and devices featuring Google’s Android software, and the Finnish handset maker is trying to revive its fortunes by using Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system.Nokia’s shares have fallen about 70 per cent since Apple launched the iPhone, which highlighted significant shortcomings with the Finnish company’s Symbian smartphone operating system. However, Nokia’s shares closed up 3.3 per cent at €6.20 on Wednesday after the company unveiled the planned job cuts.Nokia’s partnership with Microsoft, which was finalised this month, is supposed to enable the Finnish company to reduce its operating expenses by €1bn ($1.4bn) over the next three years, partly because the US technology group will be responsible for development of Windows Phone.Nokia plans to use Windows Phone as its main smartphone operating system from 2012, phasing out its use of Symbian most likely over the next two years.The group said 4,000 employees at its handset business involved in research and product development face redundancy by the end of next year. The job losses will be spread across Nokia’s operations in Finland, Denmark, India, Romania, the UK and the US.Development of its Symbian operating system will be outsourced to Accenture, the consulting and technology services group, with staff to be transferred by the end of the year.Stephen Elop, Nokia’s chief executive, said the workforce reductions were a “difficult reality”, but stressed the company now had a clear direction.The company is not planning further job reductions at its handset business, which had 59,080 employees at March 31.The 1,400 Finnish job cuts were fewer than labour leaders had feared. But Markku Palokangas, an official at the white-collar Pro union, said the redundancies would have a “negative impact” on local economies with Nokia operations, such as Oulu and Tampere.The 3,000 Nokia employees due to transfer to Accenture would initially work on Symbian software development and support services.Accenture insisted it was “premature” to say whether some of the 3,000 could eventually lose their jobs, given Nokia will phase out its use of Symbian.
192;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-04-21T09:45:45Z;How to succeed in consultancy;;"It is not yet 13 years since Zahra Barololoumi joined Accenture. Still in her 30s, she has risen to manage an international team of 60 people who provide technology services to a big client in the oil and gas industry.“What keeps me in this job? Two things: the quality of the people and the variety of the work,” she says. “The opportunities just keep on coming.”She has been part of a team implementing a medical diagnostics system within the National Health Service that she says has revolutionised cancer care in the UK. She was also involved in the UK’s launch of video-on-demand technology.Ms Barololoumi also believes variety is key when looking at qualities in new additions to her team: “I like to have a good mix of ‘types’ – analytical, expressive, practical – who drive things forward and get things done,” she says. Industry experience and technical experience are important but the role for “soft skills” should not be underestimated.All who work for her are expected to be “organised, resourceful and be real team players with great problem-solving abilities”. Empathy and self-awareness also come high on her list. “I need some with in-depth technical analysis skills, some who are ‘people persons’ – and some who are both, if I can find them,” she says.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of industry research organisation Sourceforconsulting.com and author of several books on the industry, about half of management consultancy firms have more than recovered from staffing cuts made during the recession and, on average, are employing 7.4 per cent more staff than in 2007.There is huge demand for places at graduate level – but an equal hunger among the main firms to grab the best talent. Applications for 2011 graduate training places at Ernst & Young were up 135 per cent on the previous year by the end of March, according to Dan Richards, the firm’s head of recruitment.The big strategy houses – such as McKinsey, Booz Allen Hamilton, Bain and AT Kearney – tend to look at graduates with first class honours degrees from top universities and A and A* grades at A-level.At other large firms the requirements are slightly lower. At Ernst & Young, for example, recruiters generally look for graduates with a 2:1 and 300 Ucas points, says Mr Richards.But Ms Czerniawska’s research suggests the recession has changed management consultancy firms’ organisational priorities at a more fundamental level, with a growing emphasis on hiring senior, experienced staff.“The battle to recruit the best senior people isn’t just a sign consulting firms are trying to recoup recent losses, but reflects clients’ increasing desire to work with – and willingness to pay for – more experienced people, and pointedly not junior consultants,” she says.That trend, she adds, has the potential to change the structure of many firms, making the “pyramid model”, in which project teams are dominated by juniors led by a handful of senior staff, appear less viable. It could also change the way large management consultancies compete “because smaller firms have often differentiated themselves through the seniority of their people”.Kevin Power is an example. He was chief technology officer at United Utilities, the water company, and made the shift to management consultancy in September when he joined Xantus, a small firm that helps large organisations with IT strategies.He has escaped the “coal face” of in-house IT departments and now focuses solely on strategic thinking. In his first seven months he has been involved in planning the Asia-Pacific technology for a multinational pharmaceutical company, as well as guiding a large government department on an “efficient IT” project.In addition to strategic thinking, however, experienced candidates looking to enter the world of management consultancy will be expected to display commercial savvy, says Adam Lindley, a recruitment specialist at Harvey Nash.Most firms are looking for “360-
degree consulting skills”, including an element of sales where consultants are expected to be able to increase the footprint of a current project or to spot opportunities for follow-up projects and convince clients of their merits. At manager level or above these sales skills are considered essential, he adds.Candidates from outside the consultancy industry also need to prepare themselves for a cultural change and be prepared to work extremely hard, warns Don Leslie, one of the founder-directors of Beament Leslie Thomas, a recruitment firm which specialises in hiring on behalf of management consultancy firms.Management consultancy and investment banking, he highlights, are the “two top career choices for mid-career changers”, but the average spell in a consultancy role lasts no longer than three to five years because the pace of working life is so extreme.“Expect to spend around 70 per cent of your working year away from home. That means three nights in a hotel and four days on the client site, which may be five hours journey time from home. The working week averages 50 hours, and towards the end of a project 70 hours a week is not uncommon,” he says.“It is an extremely demanding industry, in the sense that standards are high and people are expected to work hard,” agrees Alan Leaman, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association. “But it’s also an immensely rewarding environment in which to work.”"

Of the hundreds we employ each year, many become leaders in our organisation. Most initially join the analyst consulting group, where they learn core consulting skills across a variety of projects for clients in all sectors.

Do you have a big university campus presence?Consulting is not always an obvious career choice for graduates as many do not understand the role. As a result, Accenture has a significant presence on campuses, running over 500 student-focused events during the academic year. We focus on building awareness of consulting and the IT sector to inspire students and we also take a targeted approach, such as running innovative skills sessions.

How has student behaviour changed during the recession?There was a belief that students would be more eager to engage with recruiters during the recession as a result of fewer career opportunities. In fact, big organisations continued to recruit the very best university graduates so, in general, the top graduates saw little impact. The best students now have greater expectations and are very careful over where to invest their time. They demand a more tailored, bespoke approach, which will lead to a firm offer of employment.

How did you respond?We wanted to teach both students and graduates specific skills to enhance their personal and professional development. As a result we launched Boot Camp. At this event, 30 pre-screened students spend 48 hours taking part in challenges and learning experiences – the kind of experience you would only get when you join a business. Boot Camp created a stir on campuses and in 2010 we received more than 1,000 applications for every 30 places on each event.

What does the Boot Camp teach?It provides graduates and students with insight into consulting and into Accenture. More importantly, the session teaches them business skills such as leadership, presenting and problem-solving.

Does it involve military training?Boot Camp is not physically arduous but is mentally challenging. It is designed to find the highest performing students and graduates, and delegates are mentally stretched to reach their full potential.

How did you decide what training young people need?We worked with our graduate training partners. Giving students tangible business skills they can apply in any industry provides them with a head start at the beginning of their careers. We continually update the programme syllabus.

What impact does it have?Feedback tells us that Boot Camp is influential in helping them to choose a career at Accenture – more than four out of five graduates who have been through Boot Camp take a position in Accenture. The experience helps to build confidence, sharpen business skills and commercial awareness, and raises career aspirations.

Do those you employ behave differently to other graduates?Those who have been through Boot Camp have a greater knowledge of the organisation and our areas of specialisation. And they have a network in place when they start, thanks to the contacts they made.

Who benefits most – students or employer?Both. There is no obligation on the student’s part to take a job at Accenture after Boot Camp but the vast majority do accept an offer. We benefit by attracting top graduates who hit the ground running."

195;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-04-07T21:01:10Z;China and the US: Access denied;The thwarting of telecoms equipment maker Huawei’s American ambitions exposes the deepening distrust between the two superpowers;"In December 1997, Ren Zhengfei and his management team gathered by the fireplace in a Silicon Valley hotel to discuss their recent meetings with a clutch of US technology firms. While their American counterparts headed home for Christmas, the boss of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, and his team remained at work, analysing what they had seen and heard. In Mr Ren’s vision for global expansion, the US was to be the role model.“We must respect them, learn from them, critically carry on [their work],” he concluded in an article praising companies such as IBM and Bell Labs for their innovative power, speed of movement and scale. Ever since, his company has paid up to 3 per cent of its revenue each year to consultancies including IBM, Accenture and Hay Group to model its management systems on US multinationals. “This has helped us develop a common language with customers all over the world,” says a Huawei board member.But 14 years on, its love affair with America is on the rocks. While the lessons from Silicon Valley have helped the Chinese company storm markets in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Europe – and elevated it to the global number two slot – it has hit a brick wall in the US. In spite of $28bn in global revenues, $4.4bn in operating profit and a world market share of 14.2 per cent last year, it has yet to win a single network contract with a leading telecoms carrier in the US.Huawei’s frustrated attempts to make serious inroads in the US add up to more than just a corporate saga. They reveal deepening mutual distrust between China and America. In the US, there is growing frustration and alarm in the intelligence community and in Congress at its companies’ dependence on China for critical components in highly sensitive industries. There are also concerns that US groups are placed at a disadvantage by hidden financial support from Beijing for their rivals. China, for its part, suspects that America is seeking to contain its rise on all fronts, including economic.The extent of Huawei’s problems became apparent last year when the company tried to raise its stake in the US market, and each attempt ended in failure. In October, it appeared close to winning a multibillion-dollar network infrastructure contract from Sprint Nextel, the third-largest carrier in the US. Though the administration of Barack Obama lacked a formal mechanism to prevent the deal, such was its concern that Gary Locke, the commerce secretary since named ambassador to Beijing, telephoned Sprint’s chief executive. In the event, Sprint chose Samsung.Last year, Huawei also lost out to Nokia Siemens Networks in a bid for Motorola’s wireless assets, and failed to win a bid for 2wire, an internet software firm that went to Pace of the UK instead. People familiar with both failures say that concerns about the risk of regulatory delays played a role in each.Last month, Huawei was forced to agree to unwind a $2m acquisition of patents from 3Leaf, an insolvent California-based startup, after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius), which vets foreign takeovers of US assets, refused approval.In the Sprint case, Huawei had offered external validation of its equipment through Amerilink, a company set up by William Owens, a former vice-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Kevin Packingham, a former Sprint executive. But US officials never believed the group had the necessary technical capability or independence, according to people familiar with the matter. Instead, the attempt to appease government concerns was perceived as a ploy.“Things have clearly gotten much worse for Huawei,” says Mario Mancuso of Fried Frank, a global law firm, and former undersecretary of commerce.This is in part because of the rocky state of Sino-US relations, including reports of cyberattacks on US companies such as Google in China. Fairly or unfairly, says James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, America will be loath to entrust a Chinese group with access to its communications network if it has reason to suspect doing so would bolster cyberwarfare capabilities.“Awareness in the national security policy community of threats in the cyber domain has greatly increased,” says Mr Mancuso. “So if you believe that the Chinese government is engaging in cyber-intrusion, you’ll have a problem with Huawei because Huawei sits smack in the middle of the industry supplying the critical infrastructure.”Huawei sees itself as a victim of a relationship poisoned by distrust and demonisation of China. Bill Plummer, spokesman for Huawei North America, reels off a list of other stress points, including currency disputes, disagreement over Tibet and Taiwan and China’s inclination to use information security and innovation policies to shut foreign companies out of the market. “We are always seen through this prism,” he complains.Concern about the expansion of China Inc has hurt other Chinese companies. In 2005, a $18.5bn bid by state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Unocal, the US oil company, failed because of fierce political resistance. At the time, a senior official at US-based oil group Chevron, which had offered a counter bid for Unocal, told the Financial Times that the Chinese oil company had an unfair advantage thanks to “free money” from Beijing.In a recent letter to Mr Obama, senior Republican lawmakers warned about Beijing’s “extensive support” for Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese technology group, and that such financial ties “[increase] the risk that the companies feel obliged to follow its instructions”. Huawei acknowledges having several credit lines from state banks but acts only as a “bridge” between the banks and customers who need loans to buy its equipment, and says it has received no other significant government support.In 2008, Huawei retracted a bid with Bain Capital for 3Com, a US technology company, after it became clear the deal would not pass Cfius scrutiny. People familiar with the Cfius process say US concerns about Huawei are based on classified information known to only a handful of officials.US politicians have long-running complaints about transparency. As a private company, Huawei does not disclose details about its owners. Mr Ren’s history in the People’s Liberation Army has fed insinuations that the PLA could have either a stake in or special relations with Huawei. He was an officer in the engineering corps from 1974 to 1983, losing his position when the military was downsized. The company refutes the insinuations, saying Mr Ren holds no more than a 1.42 per cent stake and the rest of the company is owned by employees through a holding structure. But that has helped little to dispel doubts in the US.DateBuyers/investorsTarget/issuerStatusValue ($m)Observers see a similar lack of transparency in Huawei’s recent approach to sensitive transactions in the US. Its “efforts to better engage US authorities have been perceived as self-serving and very limited. The way they approached the 3Leaf deal has been particularly damaging”, says Mr Mancuso. Huawei did not inform Cfius of the deal. “That created the impression that they were trying to sneak in,” says Mr Mancuso.The company’s executives admit that they were ill advised and that communication strategy needs to change. “There has been the tendency to remain silent, and here in America that can be seen as consent,” says Matt Bross, co-president of Huawei North America. He says that from, now on, the company intends to be more vocal in refuting what it sees as unfair allegations.Huawei also says the process of unwinding its patent deal with 3Leaf could have some benefits for its future in the US. The company has installed a compliance officer in charge of overseeing divestment to meet Cfius demands. “This gives us the chance for the first time to have a continuous dialogue with Cfius,” Mr Bross says.Legal experts in the US stress that such dialogue is necessary to build trust with officials even when no deal is in the pipeline. But Huawei claims it was not given that chance in the past. “If you are Ericsson, you can have that. If you’re Huawei, you can’t,” says Mr Bross.Huawei also intends to install product security mechanisms to address US criticism. It plans to replicate the “secure cell” structure it uses in the UK, whereby critical software code for network products is compiled by locals and put in escrow. That comes on top of a system where US customers can choose who they want to install Huawei products and who they want to support them.This is part of the framework for a new offensive in the US. In the past year, Huawei has hired a battalion of senior sales and research staff from competitors to help win business that it has chased in vain for over a decade. For example, Jose Figueroa, for­mer Europe sales chief for Motorola’s wireless business, joined in January especially to target AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile, who share more than 90 per cent of the market.The company is also building up its research and development presence in the US. John Roese, Nortel’s former chief technology officer who joined last July, says that in the past the Huawei’s global research facilities would only “augment” R&D done in China; today, the American research base is responsible for “real innovation”. His focus is on developing cloud computing technology that will enable carriers to compete with the likes of Google and Amazon.However, the company believes that its large size will make it increasingly difficult to keep growing at the same pace as it has done to date. It has identified corporate services as a new growth driver. It plans to expand its workforce from 110,000 by another 26,000 this year alone.Even with this massive push, the task of breaking into the US market remains daunting. Although Huawei’s revenues in the US have grown almost 20-fold from $40m in 2006, at $772m last year they are still tiny compared with last year’s global revenues.But while it keeps lobbying the top-tier carriers, Huawei has started selling gear for rural networks in the US. Last month, it sold a rural broadband network to Northeast Wireless in Maine, and currently it is in talks with Sprint Rural Alliance, a group of small rural operators that have “roaming” partnerships with Sprint Nextel, for infrastructure in a few midwestern states.Even in the relatively straightforward Maine transaction, however, the problems Huawei faces in the US remain constant. At a recent congressional hearing, a senator from the state asked law enforcement officials about the deal, and revealed that the FBI had discussed the transaction with Northeast Wireless. The deal was completed and did not in the end prove controversial. But it was one more sign of Huawei’s uphill struggle in America."
196;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-03-25T20:35:51Z;Tech stocks help Wall Street to extend gains;;Oracle ticked higher after delivering solid profit and an upbeat outlook, helping to boost the technology sector and lift sentiment surrounding US stocks.The software maker reported a 37 per cent jump in revenues and a 78 per cent upturn in earnings for the third quarter, sending its shares up 1.6 per cent to $32.64. Oracle also issued a forecast for its current quarter ahead of most estimates and raised its dividend 20 per cent.Related stocks received a boost. IBM was up 1.3 per cent to $162.18 while Teradata added 1.5 per cent to $51.41. The S&P computer services index climbed by 1.1 per cent.But it was not all good news in the tech sector. Research In Motion, the maker of BlackBerry smartphones, was down 11.2 per cent to $56.89 after current-quarter guidance fell short of analysts’ expectations.RIM said the disappointing guidance in part reflected the cost of developing the BlackBerry Playbook, its answer to Apple’s iPad tablet.Shares in Apple were up 1.9 per cent to $351.54.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 index closed up 0.3 per cent to 1,313.79, bringing the total gain for the week to 2.7 per cent. Traders again seemed more focused on optimism about domestic economic recovery than concerns over uncertainty in Japan, Libya or Portugal.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,220.21 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,743.06. The indices were up 3.1 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, over the week.Helping to lift sentiment on Friday was news that the US economy had grown faster than previously thought at the end of last year. The fourth-quarter gross domestic product for the US was revised up from an annual rate of 2.8 per cent to a more healthy 3.1 per cent.Elsewhere in the markets, Accenture climbed higher after the consulting firm raised its full-year outlook and reported a 22 per cent jump in its second-quarter earnings. Shares in the group rose 4.6 per cent to $54.33.Wall Street began the week in recovery mode. The first three days of last week had seen sharp losses on the S&P after the disaster in Japan. But the index then began to recover as worries about the financial impact of the disaster on US companies subsided and the 1.5 per cent gains on Monday were a continuation of that rebound recovery. By Tuesday, the index was back to where it had been before the earthquake hit.The markets paused for breath midweek before allowing optimism to gain sway. As the week went on, traders turned their attention away from global pressures and focused more on the strengthening domestic economy.On Thursday data showed that the number of people in the US taking jobless benefits had fallen by 5,000 to 382,000 the previous week. The four-week average of claims fell to its lowest point since July 2008.“The growing strength in the US economy looks like it is finally starting to show up in the jobs market and this has been lifting sentiment on Wall Street,” said Dick Del Bello, a senior partner at Conifer Group.The S&P 500 has put on 1.4 per cent since the disaster in Japan, though it is still 2.2 per cent lower than before the eruption of conflict in north Africa and the Middle East in the middle of February. The Vix index, a measure of market volatility, was down 27.1 per cent over the week but was still up 8.5 per cent since before the tensions surfaced in the Middle EastAmong those stocks in focus over the past five days was AT&T, which announced it was buying T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39bn in a deal that would create the largest wireless carrier in the US. The stock was up 3.3 per cent over the week to $28.85.Its rival Sprint Nextel, which had also been in talks with Deutsche Telekom to merge with T-Mobile, tumbled 7.1 per cent to $4.69 over the week and was the worst performing stock on the S&P over the period. Overall, the telecoms sector added 2.2 per cent.Technology stocks saw gains after strong earnings results from a number of key industry players.Red Hat, the developer of open source software, was up 18.5 per cent to $46.34 while Micron Technology, the chipmaker, added 14.7 per cent to $11.55 over the week. Oracle was up 6.1 per cent to $32.64.Bank of America was in focus following news that the Federal Reserve had “objected” to its planned dividend increase. The stock was down 4.5 per cent to $13.34 over the week. The sector, however, was up 0.8 per cent over the week.

A specialist in healthcare restructuring, Mr Bolot – a Kiwi who earned his business degree at Northwestern in the US – has also held positions with the NHS.Negotiations with the group’s landlords continue as the company tries to get out of the onerous rental contracts that drain the money it needs to invest in upgrading homes. Chief executive Jamie Buchan has said he hopes to resolve those negotiations by July, and has brought in KPMG as advisers.In addition to Mr Bolot’s appointment, Frank McCormack, who spent more than 20 years working in legal roles for infrastructure group Balfour Beatty, joins the board as general counsel; Andrew Sellers, who qualified as an accountant with Ernst & Young, will be the group financial controller; and Amy Kroviak, previously with Luther Pendragon, joins as director of communications.…Outward insightSir John Craven, a grand old man of the City, has signed on as a senior adviser to Stonehage.Sir John’s international experience should serve the wealth manager well. He spent his school days in South Africa and knows Asia well, having lived in Tokyo while setting up Credit Suisse First Boston’s operations there and travelling frequently to China, where he has family. But he emphasised his advisory role on Monday: “I’m 71 – this is not a career move.”David Reid Scott, another City veteran, joined the advisory board as chairman last summer.…Markets masterA link to the old London Stock Exchange trading floor has been broken with the sad passing, at age 77, of Phil Cozens, a doyen of stock market reporting in the City.Cozens, who started his career in 1949, was a respected and popular face among brokers and jobbers on the floor, working for the Exchange Telegraph – once a dominant force in the supply of financial news and data to the City.As the service evolved into Extel and later AFX News, Cozens brought to the job his long list of contacts, indefatigable good cheer and generosity in helping younger reporters. In the pre-internet era, his daily list of broker tips and rumours, delivered by fax, was required reading in the City.And when many peers had opted for retirement, he continued doing what he loved, working most recently for the financial news website group Citywire, providing a version of the list he had prepared for so many years. Right up to last week, he was still writing his reports from bed.“Phil was a loyal, dedicated professional, filling the Citywire website day after day with lively copy and tipping us off with stock market scoops,” said Lawrence Lever, executive chairman of Citywire. He will be missed.…Power player: Alistair Buchanan, Ofgem CEOThe UK energy retail market may not be working, as Ofgem head Alistair Buchanan attested on Monday, but the country’s energy regulator appears to be doing overtime.Ofgem’s latest push to increase competition in the sector comes on top of seven other investigations. And these proposals are part of the third wide-ranging review in six years.Mr Buchanan, 49, has been there for it all. He joined Ofgem in 2003, following several jobs in equities analysis for investment banks, where he specialised in the energy sector.A chartered accountant, he began his career at KPMG and was awarded a CBE in 2008’s New Year’s honours list.The father of three has been battered by both sides in the battle over regulation of the sector, with consumer advocates wondering if he is too close to industry and companies arguing the UK already has the most competitive energy market in Europe.Some observers argued Mr Buchanan’s tone, as much as the substance of what he said on Monday, had companies worried. He spoke of “the stranglehold” the big six electricity providers have on the market, and said “only a radical response will suffice”.people@ft.com"
198;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-03-21T15:47:51Z;Better awareness promises action and solutions;;Whether climate change-related or not, recent severe weather events have focused business leaders’ attention on their companies’ ecological footprint and vulnerability to environmental disasters.Meanwhile, looming water and food crises have prompted some companies to expand their focus from greenhouse gases to broader environmental issues. The question is to what extent awareness is being translated into action – not only on the part of leading companies but throughout the entire business community.Certainly, many large global enterprises are bringing sustainability considerations into their business decisions.Some strategies go beyond companies’ direct operations, as in the case of Walmart, the US supermarket group, which now requires suppliers to report on the environmental impact of their products.There is even evidence that some are taking a longer-term approach to the environmental sustainability of their operations.In December, Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive, announced that his company would, among other things, be purchasing all its soyabeans, fruit and palm oil from sustainable sources by 2015. Most notably, he said the company was not interested in attracting investors who demanded increased results on a quarterly basis.At the same time, some companies are starting to look beyond carbon emissions to the conservation of natural resources such as water and biodiversity.“The risk if you focus only on carbon is that you reduce your greenhouse gas emissions but, for example, create water stress,” says Fokko Wientjes, sustainability director of DSM, the Dutch life sciences and materials sciences group, which is working with International Union for Conservation of Nature to explore the company’s biodiversity impact.“If you’re investing in biotechnology, you’d better make sure that these resources will be there by the time the developments go mainstream,” says Mr Wientjes. “Otherwise you’re investing in the wrong area.”Peter Lacy, head of sustainability for Europe, Africa and Latin America at Accenture, the consultancy, believes two new pressures could hasten the rate at which companies’ integrate broader environmental considerations into their businesses.“When you have pending water and food crises in different parts of the world, once the awareness phase kicks in, the shift to the solutions phase could in some regions move much more quickly,” he says.In Europe, legislation is helping drive corporate action on the environment. Rules now govern everything from waste – electronics manufacturers, for example, are now responsible for collecting and recycling their products – to carbon trading, while state subsidies in many countries encourage investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency.Elsewhere, however, regulatory progress on environmental issues is sluggish, if not non-existent.The latest round of climate talks in Cancún last year produced only a modest agreement on global climate change governance. Meanwhile, in the US, not only has Congress failed to pass cap-and-trade legislation but, in addition, Republicans are seeking to remove environmental regulators’ power to cut carbon emissions.Dan Esty, newly appointed commissioner of Connecticut’s consolidated Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, says that regulators should focus not only on trying to solve environmental problems but also on fostering business opportunities that could promote a clean energy economy.“They need to shift the approach away from old command and control regulation,” says Mr Esty, who is also author of Green to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage.“They should develop market mechanisms to engage the business community and get the private sector into the business of being solutions providers,” he adds.Prospects for regulators to lead the charge on cor­porate sustainability may be uncertain, but there is evidence that investors are pressing companies to adopt environmental responsibility.In this year’s round of proxy voting in the US, shareholders filed 96 environmental resolutions, 20 of which have since been withdrawn because the companies met investors’ demands.Even so, in a 2010 survey of 766 chief executives conducted by Accenture for the United Nations Global Compact, only 12 per cent of respondents said it was investor pressure that led them to incorporate sustainability into their business operations.“The trend is good. Some of those groups are being more integrated into [sustainability] conversations than in the past,” says Mr Lacy. “But the real picture is that analysts and investors who move markets are not asking the questions, whatever the SRI [socially responsible investing] community would like to think.”He argues that for investors to start playing a bigger role in driving corporate performance on environmental sustainability, companies must produce management information and performance data that demonstrate why they are in a better position than rivals in their industry.“Sustainability in the round is difficult to quantify,” says Mr Lacy. “But there are lots of ways in which we can understand and map out sustainability metrics relative to core business drivers such as revenue growth, cost reduction, risk management and intangible assets.”Technology is a powerful tool in this respect. Tracking and measurement software enables companies to establish baselines and reduce everything from emissions of greenhouse gases to water consumption. Many companies are using this technology to support greater transparency in their sustainability reporting, too.This kind of transparency is critical in moving to a low-carbon and resource-efficient economy, says Juan Costa Climent, global leader for climate change and sustainability services at Ernst & Young, the professional services firm. “If we don’t know what the environmental impact or social consequences of our businesses are, it’s very difficult to make any improvements,” he says.Mr Costa Climent believes that putting a real price on natural resources and pollution is a critical next step in shifting the global economy towards sustainable development.Some companies are starting to see the benefits of doing so. Energy savings are emerging as a clear benefit of carbon reduction programmes, for example.A recent report* by the Carbon Disclosure Project and A.T.Kearney, the management consultancy, found that 50 per cent of large businesses and 25 per cent of their suppliers had made cost savings as a result of efforts to manage their carbon emissions.Trading schemes are also helping put a price on natural resources and pollution. Carbon trading has been in operation in the European Union since 2005.Meanwhile, fledgling water trading schemes in Australia and China are demonstrating that while universal water pricing remains politically unacceptable to many, market mechanisms for pricing water could help promote its conservation.Even more innovative is the concept of payments for “ecosystem services”, with the idea being that local communities in areas rich in natural resources could be given financial incentives to act as stewards of those resources.“We have to change the price system that moves the world economy,” says Mr Costa Climent. “[This is] because we are not allocating an economic value to many of the environmental services that are provided by the global ecosystem.”Pricing these services could also help bring the analytical rigour to the measurement of corporate sustainability performance that would prompt more investors to take note.Mr Costa Climent believes that, without transparency and pricing mechanisms, the move to a resource-efficient, low-carbon world economy cannot take place fast enough.“Unless we understand and begin to explain which pieces of the global ecosystem we’re taking advantage of in our day-to-day business activities, then it’s going to be difficult to make any changes.”*The Carbon Disclosure Project 2011 Supply Chain Report
199;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-03-21T15:47:51Z;Engaging employees: Boosting staff involvement makes good financial sense;;As companies recognise the need to be sustainable and environmentally responsible, many are finding ways to involve their staff in green programmes.Engaging workers is good for morale, with the knock-on effect of improving recruitment and retention, potentially helping to attract the best talent and saving companies money.Improving staff engagement is a serious financial consideration. Gallup, a management consultancy estimates that disengagement in the US costs more than $300bn (£186bn) every year in lost productivity alone, and in 2008 it estimated the cost to the British economy at between £59.4bn ($95bn) and £64.7bn.In the same year, a report compiled by the UK Institute of Employment Studies found that increasing investment in engagement by 10 per cent generated an extra £1,500 of profit per employee annually.Ways in which companies involve their staff in green activities range from encouraging people to make sure lights and computers are switched off to training “climate champions” within the organisation, and in one case even installing beehives at company headquarters.“We had an overwhelming response when we asked staff if they wanted to train as beekeepers,” says Kitty Corrigan, deputy editor of Country Living magazine at London-based The National Magazine Company. “We now have 30 volunteer beekeepers and 30,000 bees. We harvested 50lb of honey last summer.”It’s all part of the company’s drive to lead the way in green matters. “For years now, we’ve done all the more generic things such as automatically switching off computers,” says Diane Thorpe, head of house services. “Now, we have to think more laterally about engaging with our workforce.”Forster, a UK-based public relations company with 35 staff also prioritises green engagement. It has a pool of bikes and other useful gadgets. “We also have wormeries for compostable waste and grow vegetables on site,” says Joanna Foy, Forster’s environmental officer.The company also encourages staff to travel to work sustainably by offering them five minutes extra holiday time per day for walking or cycling in, equating to 2.5 extra days off each year.At the larger end of the scale, HSBC, which has won several accolades for good green practice and employs more than 300,000 staff worldwide, has been running a “climate champion” programme since 2007.Recently expanded to include senior executives as well as lower-level staff, 2,200 people will have passed through the scheme by the end of this year.“We ask participants to tell their teams and bosses about what they learned,” says Bill Thomas, global head of sustainability for HSBC technology and services. “We’re trying to embed sustainability into the thinking of our managers.”Sky, a British satellite broadcaster, is another large company keen to engage staff in green activities, by offering cashback as an incentive to buy hybrid cars, for example.“We also do lots of environmental volunteering,” says Jo Fox, head of The Bigger Picture, Sky’s programme to ensure sustainability is at the core of its business. “More than 4,400 staff took part over the past year alone.”Although it is hard to measure, such moves appear, at least anecdotally, to have a positive effect on staff morale, and on recruitment and retention.An environmentally responsible image is becoming important for companies that wish to attract the best recruits.“The green agenda is a key consideration for the younger generation when choosing where to work,” says James Arnott, senior executive in talent & organisation performance practice of Accenture, the consultancy.Ms Thorpe says applicants for jobs at The National Magazine Company “are now asking how important green initiatives are to the business”. The same is true at Sky: “If potential applicants believe we have a strong environmental record, they’re more likely to apply to Sky and be happier to stay here,” says Ms Fox.In terms of retaining existing staff, Ms Foy says that 97 per cent of Forster employees agree the company’s green initiatives make it an appealing place to work, while, at HSBC, Mr Thomas says employees have been overwhelmingly positive about the “climate champion” programme.“We’ve never had a programme before where 100 per cent of the people said ‘we really liked it’,” he says. “People do want to help the planet, they just don’t always know how.”When HSBC staff were asked how they felt about working at the bank, Mr Thomas says the highest scoring item was the company’s sustainability work, and Ms Fox says 88 per cent of Sky employees said environmental volunteering made them proud to work there.Mr Arnott at Accenture says losing a staff member costs between 0.8 and 1.8 times the employee’s salary, so improving retention saves money.But he thinks it would be hard to tease out the financial value of improved staff retention through environmental engagement alone, because there are many factors in play when employees choose where to work.Mr Thomas agrees: “We haven’t measured the effect on retention at HSBC, and we don’t have any plans to.”But Ms Fox says Sky hopes to measure the impact of green engagement by comparing staff that volunteer with those that do not.“We expect to see those that have volunteered perform better, have better attendance rates, and stay with the business longer,” she says.That could be an important step towards pinning a financial value on green staff engagement.
200;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-03-20T22:45:07Z;US groups weigh Asia exit as costs rise;;Most big US manufacturing companies are considering relocating factories from low-cost Asian countries to the US or Latin America as they face rising logistics and transport costs, according to a report being released today by Accenture, the consultants.The earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which have wreaked havoc on global supply chains, have underlined how multinational manufacturers can find themselves stranded without critical components.For example, General Motors, the US carmaker, plans to stop production today at a factory in Louisiana that makes pick-up trucks, due to lack of parts normally supplied from Japan.Boeing, the aircraft-maker whose 787 Dreamliner relies on Japanese manufacturers for more than a third of its parts, said it had enough inventory of components for the next few weeks, but was unsure of supplies beyond that. Jamco, the Japanese company that makes the 787’s galleys, warned that deliveries could be affected by fuel shortages.Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment by revenues, said its factories around the world could be “sporadically impacted” by the disruption to its Japanese supply chain. The company has already located alternative sources for components produced by its Japanese suppliers.The problems in Japan could prompt big manufacturers to reassess the risks in their global supply chains. The Accenture report suggests that, long before the earthquake, such companies were already looking at simplifying supply chains by bringing them closer to end-markets.Some 61 per cent of manufacturing executives surveyed by the consultancy said they were considering more closely matching supply location with demand location by onshoring or “nearshoring” manufacturing and supply.Matt Reilly, Accenture’s managing director of process and innovation performance, said that this could lead to a wave of factory relocations in the next three years as big US manufacturers move production from Asia to the US and Latin America. “In the past five years, companies were driving at labour cost arbitrage and lower material costs,” Mr Reilly said.“But now that oil and transportation prices have gone up, productivity gains are not as big as they were, and there are issues around risk in supply chains, companies are starting to go where the customers are, instead of where the raw materials are.” He said the shift was also being driven by customer demands for quicker supply times and greater customisation.“A lot of what’s going on in manufacturing innovation is about trying to get customer feedback quickly and injecting that back into the supply chain, so that features and functions can be changed quickly,” he said. “It’s tough to do that when you’ve got stuff going on in Thailand or Japan.”A string of other international companies have also cautioned that their supply chains could be disrupted by the Japan quake, including Sony Ericsson, Volkswagen, Volvo and GKN, the UK car and aerospace components manufacturer.Japanese companies are racing to reopen their plants at home, but they need all of their suppliers to reopen too. Nissan said it would restart five plants today, but only to make parts rather than assemble cars. Its output will depend on the supply of components and a sixth plant in Fukushima prefecture, near the stricken Daiichi nuclear plant.For its study, Accenture surveyed executives at 287 manufacturing companies, most with headquarters in the US.Additional reporting by Robin Harding in Tokyo
201;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-03-08T16:38:47Z;Ten Questions - Kathryn Farmer;;Kathryn Farmer is an MBA scholarship student at London Business School and was on the short list for the Women of the Future Awards, MBA Star category 2010. She grew up in Worcestershire in the UK and has a history degree from Girton College, Cambridge University.Ms Farmer’s work experience to date includes a gap year after college at Andersen Consulting (now Accenture), where she was the youngest test manager on the largest project in financial services and a period at Corven Consulting, prior to starting her MBA. After graduation, she will be moving to Australia to work for Boston Consulting Group.Ms Farmer is a sports enthusiast and enjoys travelling, reading and spending time with friends.1. What academic achievement are you most proud of to date?Although not necessarily an academic achievement, I am incredibly proud to have been short-listed for the Women of the Future Awards MBA Star in 2010. This is a new category introduced by Pinky Lilani to recognise female MBA students of exceptional vision, talent and promise. I was incredibly honoured to be nominated and very humbled to feel such support from my peers, teachers and former colleagues.2. When did you know you wanted to study for an MBA?Having majored in history at university, I always knew that I would need to fill in the blanks in my business knowledge. A full-time MBA seemed to be the best route for me personally and one that was encouraged by several of my colleagues who had enjoyed their course. My goal was to challenge myself by learning new topics and also to really immerse myself in the whole business school experience. I chose to study at London Business School as it is a really diverse community and I find the course is helping me to develop alternative views on business through working with people from a wide variety of backgrounds, careers and experiences of global markets.3. What is the best piece of advice given to you by a teacher?Set your sights high. This is something that has been reinforced over time by various people but the first person (outside my family) to really say this to me was my history teacher at senior school. He was a very softly spoken but inspirational man who told me that I could achieve big things if I believed in myself. I remind myself of this when I worry that I might fail a stretch goal. This is not to fool myself into believing I can achieve everything, but because I will never know if I don’t at least try.4. What would you do if you were dean of a business school for the day?I have to admit I would probably change little of what our dean, Sir Andrew Likierman, does as I think he is a great example of a modern business school leader. Someone who is in touch with the student body, has a successful record as an academic and who can also ably represent the best interests of the school’s community externally. So, how to top that? I think I would really value just speaking to people and understanding their views on the school and what we could do to improve it. I think that this would be very meaningful when in a decision-making position. Oh – and I would give us bank holidays off too!5. What is your biggest lesson learnt?Don’t allow yourself to become complacent. When I look back at errors I have made or things I have failed in, I can see that a little bit of complacency made me lose focus on the end goal. It is enough to shock me into realising that I am not superwoman or that doing something before does not necessarily mean you can do it perfectly again. It serves to remind me that one must always work hard and not take things or people for granted.6. What advice would you give to women in business?Have confidence in your abilities. A lot of women, including myself at times, are too polite and mindful of hierarchy and, as a result don’t end up pushing their ideas through when they need to. It is important to take the opportunities to be heard and accounted for and to show others how you really think.7. How do you deal with male-dominated environments?Consultancy can be a very male-dominated environment but one which I didn’t find to be terribly difficult. In fact, some of my best mentors during my career prior to my MBA were men. The one tip I would give to other women (although it applies to everyone) is to be confident and speak up. Things will not come to those who hold back.8. What is your favourite business book?My boss at Corven gave me From Good to Great by Jim Collins one time when we were in Boston on business. We were staying in Harvard and it was the first real business book that I enjoyed reading. It seems appropriate to list this book as it got me thinking about my readiness for business school.9. What is your favourite memory of school?In my senior high school years, I really enjoyed debating and my sister and I became a bit of a ‘double act’. Competitions took us to different parts of the country and I got a real thrill from arguing a case I did not necessarily believe in. I enjoyed flipping an argument on its head and getting beneath the surface of the subject. I particularly loved the challenge of the closing speech when you had to summarise your case as well as make an impromptu criticism of the opposition’s argument.10. What are your future plans?Post graduation, I am joining Boston Consulting Group in their Sydney office. I am very excited about the move as it opens new doors for me. It is my first opportunity to live and work abroad for a long period of time and I am looking forward to working with new clients in different industries to those that I have worked with before.Outside of work, I am looking forward to exploring a new part of the world and making the most of the outdoors lifestyle! Ultimately, I would like to continue to develop, learn from others and achieve my ambitions. I chose to do an MBA at this stage in my career to prove that I have the skills and capability required to take on senior management responsibilities. I hope one day that I will be able to translate this into running my own business.Interview by Charlotte Clarke
202;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-02-23T22:56:51Z;Public role for privacy officers;Growing profession has seen its status change;When Bojana Bellamy first explored the career possibilities open to someone with her legal training, privacy issues looked like a niche – if promising – speciality. Back then, in the mid-1990s, the European Union was examining how to regulate the way companies handled the sensitive information they collected in the course of doing business, amid growing concern from consumers.Ms Bellamy’s move into the realm of privacy paid off. Information technology’s invasion of almost every area of business has brought with it a burgeoning profession: now thousands of professionals are devoted to helping companies navigate the complex legal waters around handling sensitive data.Today, Ms Bellamy is director of data privacy at Accenture, the professional services group. She oversees a team of six people, with a further 60 or so embedded within the business to ensure that personal data – whether of employees, customers or its clients’ customers – is handled appropriately.The growth of the profession has seen its status change, and the C-suite is open to those at the top of their game – the chief privacy officers. “The issue has become unavoidable for business,” Ms Bellamy says. “Strategically, you need to be seen to care about it.”Now the EU, which already has some of the most stringent data privacy rules in the world, is drafting new legislation. Some people are pushing for the role of chief privacy officer to be made mandatory for large organisations.The new rules would tackle complex issues such as whether a company can send an internal human resources database overseas for processing. Or whether a joint venture partner should be allowed access to a company’s marketing database?“Data protection has become a huge issue for business,” says Christopher Kuner, a partner at Hunton and Williams, a law firm. “Data is the raw material for many companies, like steel used to be in the old days. You have to have procedures when handling private information, like you need to have procedures when handling chemicals.”This is no longer true just for companies dealing with cutting-edge technological developments, such as cloud computing, which kick up very complex privacy issues, says Mr Kuner. “Every company has an HR database, and most have customer lists, all of which are tightly regulated.”How to prevent that database ending up, WikiLeaks-style, on the internet, is one of the issues a privacy officer must deal with.Nearly all large companies now have a lead privacy officer role, says Trevor Hughes, head of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a US trade group with about 8,000 members worldwide.As technology has evolved, so has the legal landscape around it. “There is an incredible amount of instability when it comes to data regulation across the world. The rules are always evolving – in Europe, in the US and increasingly in developing countries – and businesses need to keep up with that,” he says.The most common challenge comes with the registration of databases containing private information, which is compulsory in most jurisdictions. If the list includes entries from different countries, it may need to be registered – and regulated – by multiple national authorities with varying approaches to privacy.More complex is when companies want to send data overseas – for back-office processing functions such as billing or payroll, for example.“In the EU, the law calls for ‘adequate protection’, so you can’t undermine data protection laws when you send the data overseas,” says Gabriela Krader, corporate data protection officer of Deutsche Post DHL, the logistics group.“You need to show that you have a working data protection framework.”Companies are also likely to have sector-specific issues. Many in the technology sector are grappling with how to offer location-specific services via smartphones, for example, while at the same time not breaching their customers’ privacy.Banks or health insurance companies handle particularly sensitive information that their clients expect will not be used for marketing reasons. Others, such as delivery companies, accumulate reams of addresses as a byproduct of their operations.“Everybody has a slightly different privacy challenge, but everybody has a challenge of some sort,” says Mr Hughes.Much of the day-to-day job of a privacy officer involves helping to raise awareness within an organisation of laws on data, says Ms Krader.“The main task we have is communicating. What you need to bring across is what the legislation actually means,” she says.The principle function is, of course, to stem privacy breaches, however they might occur. Systems must be in place to ensure that a junior employee cannot download lots of sensitive files without being questioned, for example. Or that the loss of an employee laptop – a common occurrence in any business – does not degenerate into a full-blown crisis when it is discovered that it contains an unencrypted list of, say, employees’ personal details.One law being considered by the EU is to force companies that lose personal data to notify those who might be affected by the breach. The idea comes from the US, where such laws have been adopted by most states in recent years.In 2007, a privacy breach at TJX, the US retail group that owns TK Maxx, was widely publicised because of such a notification system. It had to pay $24m to banks after it was forced to reveal publicly that more than 45m credit and debit card numbers had been stolen from its system.By increasing the visibility – and financial costs – of privacy blunders, the rules strengthen the business case for companies to strengthen their compliance efforts.According to Ms Bellamy, it often takes an incident involving a data breach to galvanise a company to hire its first chief privacy officer, or to bolster its existing capabilities.Beyond the legal and reputational threats associated with data protection blunders, privacy officers say their job is also about improving the way data are used in an organisation.“It is as much a strategic as a preventive role,” says Ms Bellamy. “We can add value, for example, by incorporating privacy in our product offering. For clients that entrust us with a huge amount of information, how we handle their data is of critical importance.”That echoes calls made by Brussels for companies to adopt a “privacy-by-design” approach, where data protection is considered during the design process of a new product or service, rather than as an afterthought.It is a line that the public sector is now pushing, with some tenders both in the US and Europe specifying data protection as a precondition for companies looking to provide services to the government.From the legal side, the swell of concern around handling personal data is unlikely to go away.“Privacy protection is like environmental compliance: you need to show you’re on top of it,” says Mr Kuner.
203;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-01-28T14:53:07Z;Debt advice ‘needs simplifying’;The British Bankers’ Association calls for a ‘radical reform’ of the debt managment system, to protect individuals from unscrupulous operators;The UK’s debt advice system should be ‘radically reformed’ to make it easier to understand, and to protect individuals from unscrupulous operators, according to a new report.A ‘single body to regulate debt advice’ and ‘simpler debt remedies’ are two key proposals to put forward by the British Bankers’ Association on Friday to help to ‘streamline the process of debt management’.The report, ‘A New Model for Dealing with Personal Debt’, states that people struggling with debts should have a clear range of options, while there should also be greater consistency in the way debt advice is provided and how creditors deal with people who are in financial difficulties.This comes at a time when personal debt in the UK stands at nearly £1.5 trillion and personal insolvency rates have risen to record levels. Individuals struggling to keep up with their debts currently face a confusing range of options, including both informal and formal solutions, while some groups offer free advice and others charge for it.The BBA said the existing range of debt solutions, which include informal plans under which people repay what they can each month, to bankruptcy as a last resort, should be made simpler to understand.The report, which was carried out with management consultancy firm Accenture, suggested introducing a range of options which would be based on the consumers’ financial circumstances.These would include early forbearance for people in temporary financial difficulties, as well as Debt Repayment Plans, under which interest and charges would be frozen in exchange for people making partial repayments each month.In other cases, creditors could use people’s assets as a security against their debt to give them breathing space at a time when their income had fallen.In the most extreme cases, debts could still be written off through bankruptcy, if consumers had no income, no assets and little prospect of ever repaying what they owed. There would also be an increased emphasis on early intervention, to try to help people before their situation had got out of control and their debts had increased.The publication of the report comes as the Office of Fair Trading announced that 35 debt management companies have lost their consumer credit licences as a result of a compliance review. This also follows a warning to 129 firms in September after the OFT’s review of the debt management sector found widespread problems with compliance.Paul Ross, BBA policy director and co-author of the report, said: “Our vision is to provide a clear and coherent process to help people facing debt difficulties, to intervene early where possible and to provide a simple debt resolution solution if those early attempts do not succeed. We want to unravel the red tape to bring about a more financially responsible solution for customers.”The report has been welcomed by the industry. Delroy Corinaldi of the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, said: “Those struggling with debt are often stressed and confused about their situation and need clear, independent advice and support of the highest standards. It appears that this is still not the case within the fee-charging debt management sector.“Many households will be pushed closer to the edge this year. I fear that more people who may be just about managing to make ends meet now will find themselves unable to keep up with their credit commitments as the year progresses, and worried and unclear as to what help is available, will end up paying for debt advice.”Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, also said she supported a move towards more regulation of the industry. She said: “We have heard fee charging debt management companies claim their industry is necessary because not-for-profit providers are unable to meet the demand for help. But the OFT’s investigation makes it crystal clear that much of the fee charging industry is not in a fit shape to be trusted to fill that gap.“Dealing with unmanageable debt is a difficult problem that leaves many people vulnerable. It is vital that people who take the brave step of trying to repay their debts and get on top of their finances are helped back to financial health, rather than preyed on by commercial organisations eager for a quick profit.”
204;ACN;Accenture Plc;2011-01-25T16:10:32Z;Digital delivery: Supplier-consumer relationship undergoes a revolution;;A couple of years ago Accenture, the world’s largest technology consultancy, was chosen by Universal Music Group, the world’s largest music company, to provide digital supply chain services outside North America.Last month, the success of the arrangement was confirmed by a broadening of the relationship through which the consultancy will roll out its retail services platform on a worldwide basis.“This” the companies said, “will provide UMG with an alternative means of distributing digital content to its global business partners and consumers”.This partnership between two global groups illustrates how conventional ways of doing business can and are being changed by digital technologies. Digital supply chains – in which nothing moves physically apart from electrons and photons – are revolutionising the links between suppliers and manufacturers, and between retailers and consumers.So far, the industries involved have been those in which the product can easily be digitised – text, images, music and video – but it may be only a matter of time before products are physically created locally or even in consumers’ homes using machines driven by instructions delivered over the internet.The textile industry has for some years been predicting the advent of a home-based garment knitting machine. Printers capable of building three-dimensional objects layer by layer are emerging from the laboratory.Royston Seaward, a partner in the consultancy Deloitte’s technology integration practice who was involved in the design and delivery of the BBC’s iPlayer, says that while the move towards shipping digital products and services is changing how vendors interact with their customers, it is also changing the underlying capability needed by an organisation to do it well.He says: “The consumer expects to be able to self-serve, to be able to ‘rent’ services as well as buy, and to use his or her purchase in different ways and on different devices.“In the digital supply chain,” he goes on, “the concept of a ‘return’ doesn’t really exist and the vendor risks its product being copied and used many times. That means that as well as a changing supply chain, how a vendor designs and protects its product is key to exploiting the opportunity.”Toby Nichols, supply chain specialist with PA consulting group, says that, in order to succeed, companies must achieve totally integrated digital operations where digital content of all types is created, stored, shared and accessed quickly, efficiently and securely across all operations and by each member of the content value chain.He says: “For example, BMW provides updates on faults and performance in its cars online, reducing the need for garage visits and interactions with the physical chain.”He also cites Google’s internet search engine capability linked to pay-per-click advertising, Sky’s virtual monopoly on live Premiership football in the UK (protected by an effective scrambling system) and Apple’s iTunes store. “By using the iTunes site to make digital content available to end-users, it made virtual shopping simple,” he says.Digital supply chains differ from their physical counterparts in many ways, some obvious, some not. While a physical product is in transit, it is owned, at any one time, by a member of the chain. Virtual goods, however, as Graham Hann, technology partner with Taylor Wessing, the international law firm says, are protected by intellectual property rights – the most relevant being copyright.He points out that copyright law varies from country to country and so when distributing a digital asset through an international supply chain – Accenture’s work in distributing the products of Universal Music Group, for example – the laws in each relevant country have to be considered.He says: “We do not have a private copying exception in the UK and, as such, uploading of CDs to digital platforms such as iTunes is illegal. This is not the case in countries such as France or Germany, where consumers are charged a levy on blank media such as CDs, which is used to pay rights owners.”Concerns that cyber criminals could introduce security vulnerabilities into information technology equipment passing through the supply chain have led to the formation of a Trusted Technology Forum backed by IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle and Nasa among others.Co-ordinated by the Open Group, a not-for-profit consortium, the initial aim is to release a framework that will unify “industry best practices that contribute to the secure and trusted development, manufacture, delivery and ongoing operation of commercial hardware and software products”.The digital supply chain may have advantages over its physical counterpart, but it is clearly only as strong as its weakest electronic link.
205;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-12-23T17:25:21Z;Moving from ‘Information’ to ‘Insights’;;The unprecedented volatility in today’s business environment has made it crucial that companies can quickly reconfigure strategic priorities. For most companies, this means re-evaluating the quality and effectiveness of their decision-making processes to ensure that decisions are informed by business insights.Chief Information Officers have a vital role to play here. Gartner, the IT analyst firm, recently put this into perspective, saying: “When organisations have to navigate a business transformation, the IT organisation is usually in the middle of it in some way, either as a key enabler or a key constraint. CIOs…need to prepare more vigorously to ensure that IT does its job to advance strategic change.”To do so successfully, CIOs must combine their love of technology with a broader awareness of strategic context. Specifically, this means moving IT’s focus from managing and securing data towards manipulating it to obtain insights that drive fact-based decision-making and competitive advantage. If they can do this, CIOs have an opportunity to emerge as ‘Chief Insight Officers’ – staking their claim to be significant business partners in their organisations.The good news is that CIOs will not be starting from scratch. Most larger companies have already invested in key technology infrastructure - data warehousing and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, for example. But at best, these capabilities are only equipped to process and store proprietary data. The next step must be to mash up this vital internal resource with targeted external data to deliver strategic insights in real time.The end goal for CIOs is to ensure that key decision-makers including the chief executive, are plugged into the targeted data and insights that will let them answer the question “What is the best that can happen?” If they can succeed in this objective, the benefits could be substantial.Take Sales & Operations Planning, for example. Vital strategic ‘bets’ for this core function are still being placed on the ‘HIPPO approach’ (the highest-paid person’s opinion) – with gut feeling the deciding factor in most instances. This could be transformed, provided CIOs can successfully embed predictive analytics capabilities into the fabric of re-engineered decision-making processes.Of course, the scale of the ‘data challenge’ should not be underestimated. In a 2009 Accenture survey of 600 UK and US blue-chip companies, two-thirds of respondents cited ‘getting their data in order’ as an immediate priority. And around 40 percent said that their current technological resources and systems significantly impeded the effective use of enterprise-wide analytics.Because of such deficiencies, these companies are finding it difficult to forecast market trends, pinpoint optimum purchasing options or nurture rising talent – just a few examples of areas where analytics ‘leaders’ such as Google, Capital One, and Tesco in the UK are realising powerful benefits.Commitment to analytics need not be the preserve of technology-driven giants. The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is using predictive analytics techniques to enable innovative decision-making. For example, backed by sophisticated audience analysis, the RSC was able to launch a much broader range of productions and audience experiences. The risk paid off, with a 20-plus per cent increase in ticket sales over previous Stratford-upon-Avon seasons.To ensure their organisations can realise such benefits, CIOs can and should be taking the initiative, first, by demonstrating to the business at large their commitment to fact-based decision-making, and second, embedding analytics into decision-making processes throughout the organisation.All companies have ‘got’ reporting. They routinely use descriptive, backward-looking analytics to handle that process. Having already invested in the hardware, software and talent they need to manage that core function, the challenge for CIOs is to connect these capabilities organisation-wide, while exploiting developments in predictive analytics technologies to enable what is, literally, ‘business thinking’.This means answering a host of tough questions. How should we reorganise our systems and processes? How can we acquire the right analytical talent to drive this new capability? What’s the most effective way of unlocking the insights within social networks?We know that winning companies – those that achieve a higher return on invested capital – exit recessionary periods as leaders and sustain their advantage over time. These are the organisations that exploit the opportunities at hand, using the cash-flow generated by cost-reduction programmes to reinvest in innovation and create their own upturn.As Chief Insight Officers, CIOs will play a vital role in galvanising and sustaining this process, helping to define the critical processes needed to deliver insights to key decision-makers and, as important, to define the data sources that will inform these insights.Dave Rich is Global Managing Director of Accenture Analytics
206;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Debate reopens over equity trades;Flash crash heightens focus on concern over modern-day trading;The US Securities and Exchange Commission had wanted a broad debate about how well US equity markets were functioning amid widespread concerns that rules had not kept up with dramatic changes in trading.Advances in technology have meant that numerous exchanges compete to attract trading volume from a small number of computer-driven high-speed traders.But this debate was destined to change on May 6 with a brief but sharp stock market plunge. This so-called “flash crash” grabbed centre stage for the market regulator and soon, bigger questions about the benefits or costs resulting from shifting trading styles of US stocks were pushed to the background.US lawmakers and media have instead honed in on the flash crash, demanding the SEC prevents another one. Indeed, the SEC has set rules for the way stocks are traded in the hope of restoring some of the damaged confidence in shares among many of the individual investors who the regulator is charged with protecting.The May 6 flash crash triggered furious knock-on selling in one part of the market, and prompted other traders to quickly withdraw from others. In some cases, this left only “stub quotes” – entered into computers under the assumption that they would never be used – to be executed, resulting in shares of blue chips like Accenture trading at 1 cent.Following a report that pointed to an unusually aggressive automated or “algorithmic” trading order from an investor as the initial spark, the SEC proposed rules that were heavily influenced by the crash.The SEC and the regulated exchanges like NYSE, Nasdaq and BATS have since launched test programmes to ban stub quotes, have added market-wide “circuit breakers” to slow down gyrations by halting trading in many stocks and exchange-traded funds when prices jump, and have limited direct access to markets by high-speed traders.Yet the focus on the flash crash has generated concerns that the bigger debate about modern-day trading is not being tackled. At a recent Senate hearing, Mary Schapiro, SEC chair, along with Gary Gensler, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates futures, were scolded by senators for taking several months to put out a post-crash report, and not yet formulating a broad plan to prevent future crashes. “Our regulators are riding the equivalent of mopeds …chasing traders whose cars are going 100 miles per hour,” said Carl Levin, US senator from Michigan, at the hearing.In response, Ms Schapiro said that her agency was struggling with a crushing workload, including writing rules created by the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform bill, and addressing a spate of insider trading cases. She said 400 additional staff were needed.At such a key time, it is not surprising that the flash crash has become the focus. “It would be disastrous for the agency for another May 6 to happen. Preventing that still has to be the SEC’s top priority,” said a person familiar with the agency’s thinking. The SEC does not comment on ongoing policymaking.In its equity market structure “concept release” put out in January, the SEC set out to examine issues like whether trading in fractions of a second should be regulated as well as the impact of “internalisation” of trading orders via dark pools and intra-broker platforms.“While we support moving forward to address market inefficiencies raised by the flash crash, it’s very important not to lose focus on the fundamental reforms investors would like to see,” says Ari Burstein, senior counsel at the Investment Company Institute, which represents mutual funds and other registered investment groups.Yet in some ways, the flash crash has also broadened the debate, by asking whether algorithms that drive trading by traditional investors and high-frequency traders alike should be explicitly regulated. The “concept release” did not address this issue.The tone for debate will be set by a report expected in February by a flash crash commission authorised by lawmakers. That group includes the agency heads of the SEC and CFTC as well as eight outside experts such as Joseph Stiglitz, Columbia University economist. “It’s hard to separate May 6 from broader market issues,” says David Ruder, former SEC chair and current professor at Northwestern University Law School, who is a committee member. “That has particularly to do with high-frequency trading.”

The US joint venture is Vodafone’s biggest unit, contributing about 39 per cent of group earnings.Citigroup forecast that Verizon Wireless would sell 10m iPhones in 2011, a roll-out that will initially weigh on margins. But the expected boost to subscriber growth and average user revenues led Citi to raise its Vodafone earnings forecast by 4.6 per cent for 2012.It recommended that US clients favour Vodafone shares over Verizon’s to benefit from the growth.The last options expiry of the year meant volumes across the wider market were up on recent levels, but the FTSE still ended down 0.2 per cent, or 9.37 points, to 5,871.75. That gave the index a 1 per cent gain for the week.Financial stocks moved lower after a profit warning by Lloyds Banking Groupon bad debts in Ireland.Lloyds, down 3.6 per cent to 66½p, said a 10 per cent of its £26.7bn Irish portfolio would be impaired by the end of the year, meaning more than half the book was classed as non-performing.Royal Bank of Scotland, which has a £55bn Irish loan portfolio, fell 5.7 per cent to 37¾p.Taking Lloyds’ write-off rates would imply another £11bn of impairments at RBS, equivalent to about 10p of book value per share, analysts said.AstraZeneca dropped 6.7 per cent to £29.41 after US regulators unexpectedly requested additional trial analysis for its Brilinta blood thinning drug.“Approval for Brilinta in the US was essential for a positive investment case, as the drug was set to represent 50 per cent of the pipeline’s value out to 2014,” said Raymond James analysts. Even if the drug were to be approved it would not now be on the US market before 2012, when it would face head-to-head competition with generic pills, they said.Fresh snowfalls across Britain weighed on the retailers, with Marks and Spencerdown 1.7 per cent to 375½p, Next off 1.8 per cent to £19.85 and Dixons Retail4.5 per cent weaker at 24¼p.Supergroup lost 3.8 per cent to £13.61. Goldman Sachs cut earnings forecasts by 13 per cent to reflect new tax guidance.Leading the blue-chip risers, Autonomy climbed 5.3 per cent to £15.43 following better than expected results overnight from technology companies including Oracle and Accenture.GKN rose 1.4 per cent to 216¾p, helped by a SocGen upgrade to “buy”.SocGen said: “The recent announcement by carmakers indicating only very short Christmas holidays is likely to mean that GKN’s fourth-quarter sales are ahead of the flat guidance given with the trading statement in mid-October.”Punch Taverns jumped 11.7 per cent to 74½p after the pub operator said it was likely to meet full-year forecasts after sales improved at its managed division.Punch gave no update on its structure but Citi, the company’s house broker, said it could walk away from its debt-burdened tenanted divisions at no cost.The broker upgraded Punch shares to “buy” with a 100p target price.ITE Group, the exhibitions organiser, gained 11.8 per cent to 244p after it bought Moscow-based peer MVK for €33m.Beleaguered fund manager Gartmore climbed 6.1 per cent to 104¾p on a report that it may agree a takeover by Henderson Group within weeks.Traders believe any deal would be largely funded with shares, given Henderson is very unlikely to pay Gartmore’s current price in cash.Among the fallers, Misys slipped 1.4 per cent to 309p. UBS, downgrading to “neutral,” argued that a bid approach appeared unlikely in the near future.888 Holdings jumped 12.6 per cent to 49p on a revival of rumours that the internet casino was a target for Caesars Entertainment, the US gambling group previously known as Harrah’s.Tribal Group rose 10.7 per cent to 47¼p after admitting it was back in talks with a potential bidder, just over a month after its last takeover proposal collapsed.Phorm soared by 72 per cent to 107½p after it raised survival funding. The internet advertising group secured £6m through the issue of convertible secured loan notes carrying an annual coupon of 15 per cent. “The group’s aim is to validate the business model and then secure further funding in order to pay off this to minimise the dilution impact to existing shareholders,” said Mirabaud Securities.Southern Cross Healthcare rose 2.8 per cent to 18½p after dealers picked up on recent stakebuilding. Waterfall, a vehicle for a Guernsey-based fund, took a 9.4 per cent stake in the care homes operator, which said last month it was in talks with potential bidders.Bezant Resources rose 6.6 per cent to 41¼p after the miner published estimates showing total recoverable reserves at the flagship Mankayan project in the Philippines of 811,000 tonnes of copper and 2.21m ounces of gold. Investors expect another update on the project early next year.Noricum Gold rose to 6.13p on its first day on Aim following a placing at 4p to raise £2.1m. The money would be used to fund the first stage of exploration at its primary asset, the Rotgülden gold project in Austria, the company said.
208;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-12-14T17:19:48Z;Advantages of high-performing IT;;"The gap between high-performing information technology (IT) functions and the rest of the pack is widening. That’s what Accenture found recently after surveying 226 top IT executives – CIOs and other most senior IT leaders – of the world’s largest private and public sector companies and organisations.In the category of innovation, for example, the research revealed that the gap between high performers and their peers grew from 31 per cent to 42 per cent since 2008 when the study was last conducted. In the area of execution, the gap rose from 30 per cent to 37 per cent.One reason for the widening chasm is that many companies took a tepid approach to IT during the recent economic downturn, cutting budgets and focusing primarily on maintenance. Meanwhile, the high-performing organisations did the opposite. And they didn’t do just a few things well – they excelled across the board. For example, compared with their peers, high performers:• have web-enabled 42 per cent more of their customer interactions and 93 per cent more of their suppliers interactions;• are 44 per cent more likely to recognise the strategic role IT plays in customer satisfaction;• are eight times more likely to consistently measure the benefits realised from strategic IT initiatives;• spend 29 per cent more annually on developing and implementing new applications rather than on maintaining existing ones; and• are twice as likely to prioritise workforce performance.As a result of the study, we concluded that CIOs today have a clear choice: they can maintain the status quo and view cost management as a top priority, or they can proactively take steps to improve their organisation’s agility, innovation and execution, leveraging these capabilities to refocus their efforts around meeting core business objectives – like customer satisfaction and employee productivity – to establish a stronger partnership with the business. This can help them not only achieve high performer status, but also eliminate the gap that often separates IT from business strategy.Accenture’s research shows how high performers have demonstrated excellence in nine capabilities:1. Strategic IT Alignment. High-performing CIOs are much better at defining how IT can help achieve core business objectives. They are three times as likely to deliver on these objectives in terms of new products and services, and twice as likely to cite IT’s strategic role in improving employee productivity. With 70 per cent of their resources devoted to deploying, testing, integrating, building or enhancing applications, they spend more time building new functionality and less time “keeping the lights on.”2. IT Governance. High performers turn cost savings and efficiency improvements into re-investments that add value, at a time when many IT organisations continue to focus on cutting spending. They are twice as likely to develop a business case for new IT initiatives and eight times more likely to measure the benefits realised from these projects.3. Application Architecture. IT leaders score far higher when emphasizing the importance of a target application architecture centered on such key objectives as scheduling and implementing regular refreshes of the application architecture; proactively applying architecture principles in initiatives; and understanding the importance of avoiding duplication in their application portfolios. The state of Michigan, for example, found that taking a bottom-up approach to its application architecture can lead to strategic reallocation of resources to innovation initiatives. With a constrained budget, the Michigan Department of Human Services asked IT for assistance in developing a new eligibility system for residents. The State reviewed 47 projects that were focused on enhancing legacy systems and by deferring 38 of them, was able to invest in the new system. Prioritization of this project was reinforced by a strong business case showing how it would reduce caseworkers’ administration loads through an integrated eligibility system.4. Information Management. Not surprisingly, high performers are twice as likely to develop target data architectures and effective business intelligence and analytics capability, as well as data governance. This gives employees far greater access to the most detailed and real-time information they need to do their jobs.5. Service Management and Operations. High performers are much further along in the journey toward centralised, fully virtualised environments. This puts them in a better position to migrate enterprise infrastructure and applications to private or public cloud services.6. Solutions Delivery. High performers are six times more likely to provide real-time visibility into processes and four times more likely to provide real-time dashboards and alert systems. Spending significantly more on developing and implementing applications than on running them helps enable innovation and business agility.7. Workforce and Resource Management. Workforce management is a top priority among high performers. They are over seven times more likely to be investing in new technology skills development; six times more likely to have a plan in place to address the ageing workforce and the potential loss of institutional knowledge as workers begin to retire; and three times more likely to develop new career tracks to develop future IT workers. As an example, China Light & Power, one of the leading power companies in the Asia-Pacific region, spent the past six years transforming its IT workforce into what it calls “a smart army” of business savvy technologists. This led to a cultural shift centred on business value creation, customer care, passion and innovation.8. Information and Technology Security. High performers are more likely to have a Chief Security Officer in place with a clear role in the organisation. Additionally, they are three times as likely to co-ordinate security governance with lines of business and twice as likely to define an overall security strategy.9. Outsourcing. High performers strategically use outsourcing to gain access to critical IT skills, improve their agility and flexibility, increase the effectiveness of business processes, and lower the total cost of ownership of applications and infrastructure. These high-performing IT leaders also approach outsourcing as a partnership with their service providers, allowing them to extract significantly more value out of their application and infrastructure outsourcing initiatives through the use of sophisticated metrics.The research shows that business and IT leaders must maintain their focus on improving IT value and gaining a competitive advantage, while improving IT’s economy.These are not mutually exclusive, as improving performance in one area will help improve it in the other two as well.So the choice is clear: the power to change the business’ perception of IT from that of order-taker to enabler of business transformation and innovation is in the CIO’s hands. CIOs can accept a role as a keeper of the status quo for the business, or they can begin taking steps to improve the agility, innovation and execution of their IT organisations in order to establish a stronger partnership with the business. These steps can help them bridge not only the gap that exists between their organisations and high performers, but also the boundary that, in many companies, continues to separate IT from business strategy.Gavin Michael is managing director of R&D and alliances, Accenture"
209;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-12-13T20:30:25Z;Companies face the people’s fury over taxes;What annoys objectors is they can’t work in Pittsburgh and pay (or not pay) taxes in Bermuda;Saturday is Pay Day. That is what activists are calling their day of action against companies they accuse of not paying their share of corporation tax. They are targeting Vodafone and Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia retailing group. On previous occasions, demonstrators have blocked store entrances and glued themselves to the windows.People who would never join a “flash mob” or, perhaps, even know what one was, sympathise with the cause, if not with the methods. The Daily Mail, middle England’s favourite newspaper, said that while it did not condone the protesters’ actions, “we can understand why many hard-pressed Britons will share their sense of injustice”. The newspaper also accused Kraft Foods of the US of trying to “dodge the taxman” by moving some functions of Cadbury, the UK confectioner it acquired this year, to Switzerland. On the Mail’s website, readers called for a boycott of Cadbury’s products.Are these protests justified? The activists claim Vodafone owes the UK tax authorities £6bn ($10bn). In fact, the mobile phone operator settled its argument with the Revenue & Customs in July, agreeing to pay £1.25bn. The company itself appears to think it got off lightly – it had made provision in its accounts for £2.2bn. But it has paid all outstanding amounts and not even the saintliest taxpayer feels obliged to hand over money the authorities are not demanding.Sir Philip’s is a different case. He is a UK taxpayer, but Tina, his wife, who owns the company, lives in Monaco, which meant she paid no tax on a £1.2bn dividend she received in 2005. This is entirely legal. I would imagine most readers of (and writers for) this newspaper divide their family assets to minimise their tax liabilities. But by residing in the same country as our spouses (and having less to share), we avoid this level of hostility.As for Kraft, it runs its European operating company out of Zurich – Switzerland being a favoured home for many companies. Kraft says it is integrating Cadbury into its European structure. It says the balance between employee numbers in the UK and Ireland (about 7,000) and Zurich (fewer than 1,000) will not change much, but then the tax base is rarely where the jobs are.I suspect that this is what most annoys objectors to companies’ tax arrangements. It is not just that they believe companies are evading their responsibilities at a time when taxpayers face the slashing of their services. It is that it all seems so contrived. Ordinary people cannot work in Pittsburgh and pay (or not pay) tax in Bermuda, or live in Birmingham and enjoy Geneva’s tax rates. Why should companies be able to do so?Underlying this is one of the oldest business debates. To whom do companies owe their duty? To the society in which they operate or to their shareholders? The latter view has held sway in recent decades, which is why companies have done everything possible to reduce their tax payments.If all countries had the same corporate rates and the same approach to taxing worldwide earnings, there would be no point in moving. But as that could probably be achieved only through world government, there will often be tax advantages to locating corporate functions elsewhere.France and Germany put pressure on Ireland to raise its unusually low corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent as the price for a European Union bail-out. It resisted. The country has attracted not just US technology and pharmaceutical groups, but has become the official domicile of UK companies such as WPP, the advertising and communications company, and Shire, the pharmaceuticals group.Companies sometimes succumb to pressure. When Accenture, the consulting group, decided to move its official incorporation out of Bermuda, it mentioned negative publicity from being associated with countries that did not have tax treaties with the US. It added that it feared it might struggle to win government contracts. So where did it move to? Delaware? No, Ireland.Given the savings to be made, the pressure on companies would have to be considerable to persuade them to give up their tax arrangements. It would be easier to prise glued-on protesters from store windows than companies from their tax advisers.A sustained consumer boycott of these companies might make a difference, but, as I have arguedin previous columns, these seldom inflict any real damage. Announcing that knighthoods would go only to company bosses with headquarters in the UK would produce some interesting corporate dilemmas, but which government would be brave enough to risk the drop in political donations that might follow?Companies will probably tough this one out. But some of their leaders are in for an uncomfortable ride from an angry populace.michael.skapinker@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/michaelskapinker

211;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

213;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-12-07T23:23:52Z;Automated processes: Specialist add-ons allow finance to focus on core;;The growing regulatory and compliance burden on chief financial officers and finance directors is well documented. Technology can offer at least a partial solution.The large enterprise resource planning (ERP) projects of the 1990s set out to automate the core functions of business. The fastest growing area for financial applications today is smaller, niche tools that can cut some of the administrative burden on finance departments, and free them to concentrate on their core functions of reporting, and driving profitability.Businesses are looking to “best of breed” or “edge” applications, including time and expense management, electronic invoicing and procurement to extend ERP and core financial systems into these areas.“Best of breed products are often bolted on to ERP, because of their faster deployment or simplified total cost of ownership,” says Anoop Sagoo, a senior executive at consulting business Accenture. “Collections, for example, is an area where there are a number of excellent products and clients often prefer them to extending ERP.”Much of this is going hand in hand with a move to “shared services”, where support functions in an organisation are consolidated in a single in-house provider – and especially, the move towards employee or supplier self-service. Giving staff tools to manage expenses, via devices such as the BlackBerry or iPhone, has two benefits.It reduces the volume of paper to process, and provides businesses with a much more up-to-date view of their true cash position, especially where they have large numbers of employees, such as sales forces, running up expenses.Automating systems can also improve compliance with purchasing and procurement rules, although CFOs do need to avoid overly rigid systems that can obstruct the company’s ability to do business.However, in areas such as e-invoicing and supplier portals, process rigidity is usually beneficial: obliging suppliers to quote a purchase order, for example, promotes better auditing of spending. And requiring suppliers to submit invoices online, or moving to a self-billing system, removes large amounts of re-keying and can cut the number of defects or exceptions thrown up by the purchasing process.For this reason, businesses such as grocery retailers – with large product ranges and numbers of suppliers – are among the early adopters of e-invoicing systems. Such tools are rarely built into off-the-shelf ERP.ERP vendors may well extend their capabilities into areas such as purchasing, e-invoicing and time and expense management, but industry analysts believe they are more likely to do so through acquisition, rather than by developing the technology.One reason is the industry-specific nature of many systems. Another is the complexity of ERP, which does not always lend itself to fairly simple, low-value tasks.Some of the more successful companies providing extensions to ERP have done so through an online, or software as a service (SaaS) delivery model. This allows the vendor to provide a niche service to a large number of customers at a low cost, with businesses paying per transaction, or a monthly fee.A specialist should also be able to offer more functionality, than an ERP vendor, which has to meet a much wider set of customer needs.This allows their customers to obtain new functionality quickly, and removes some practical and security concerns – such as providing access to staff mobile devices, or supplier systems – and puts them in the hands of the technology vendor.“A lot of business processes revolve around finance, but are not well served by the core finance or accounting systems vendors, so you have the best of breed market,” says Paul Hamerman, vice-president of enterprise applications at Forrester, the industry analysts.“A lot are sold as SaaS. Time and expense management is a good example of an area that is better done as a SaaS model, as it provides better usability, and businesses can, for example, pay a fee for every expense report submitted.”The growth in the SaaS market is allowing finance departments to automate more of their processes without tying up precious capital in IT hardware or expensive software upgrades. And, with transaction-based pricing, it also allows businesses to scale the service up and down with demand.One issue faced by many finance departments during the downturn was that processing costs remained relatively fixed, even when business volumes were low. As a result, the “cost to serve” the business by finance rose.Inevitably, however, there is a risk posed by going outside the core ERP or financial systems for functionality. Separate systems run the risk of creating new “islands of data” that are not visible to the centre, or may need additional work by the IT department to integrate applications with the back office.Technologies such as service-oriented architecture (SOA) and XBRL (extensible business reporting language) are making it easier to tie add-ons to core systems.Most vendors in purchasing or collections, e-invoicing and time and expense management can connect their software to the large ERP systems from Oracle and SAP.Matters are harder for mid-sized companies: the wide range of mid-market ERP systems can make it economically difficult to justify building connectors to an application.Mid-sized companies might find they need to carry out more behind the scenes integration than larger competitors.
214;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Business processes: A tool that is too ad hoc and open to error;;Spreadsheets play a vital role in helping many businesses manage their affairs. But their limitations mean they should not be allowed to become too important a means of crunching the numbers.“Spreadsheets are very good at exploratory work with numbers when you don’t have a precise end goal in mind,” says Giles Thomas, founder and chief executive of Resolver Systems, which helps clients in the insurance and finance fields solve their spreadsheet problems.“I have seen spreadsheets used in small hedge funds for practically everything,” Mr Thomas explains. “Businesses that start using spreadsheets for a specific purpose can get grabbed and they never escape. When you have a spreadsheet with thousands of rows in it, things can get quite nasty.”Spreadsheets do not require programming skills and they are so convenient and easy to use that they are often employed long after the company should have switched to a more appropriate business management package.As new employees create their own spreadsheet applications they proliferate.“Most companies bemoan the fact that they have a spreadsheet jungle,” comments Andrew Meade, UK head of finance and performance management for Accenture, the consulting business.“Even companies with sophisticated systems will use spreadsheets as an important tool. Lots of companies would like to minimise their use and put more information through their main systems to get standardisation and more control.”Many of the problems blamed on spreadsheets are often the result of human error – itself frequently the result of poor training or supervision.“It often is a people problem but the spreadsheet doesn’t help,” says Mr Thomas. “It will give you enough rope to hang yourself – and then some.”One of the most common causes of problems is the copy-and-paste function which can result in the wrong data being fed into the calculations. An investment company that based its investment decisions on two measures calculated from the underlying economic data realised that it was coming up with some odd results.“We had a good look and realised that half way down one column they were measuring a different metric,” says Mr Thomas.“For several months, they had been running the business on numbers that were meaningless. When people copy and paste, they often forget to incorporate the changes they have made.”Sometimes a spreadsheet will identify a number in a series as text and ignore it so that the series and the calculation are not complete. Careless inputting of data can result in a date going into the invoice number column or the client’s name where the price should be.Companies have on occasion been forced to bring forward results announcements when supposedly confidential information included on a spreadsheet has been revealed. Data that people thought they had blacked out can sometimes be restored by the use of software.The ease with which multiple users can contribute to or amend a spreadsheet is also a cause of difficulties. It can be tricky to keep track of who has made changes and to remember the assumptions on which calculations are based.Providing a clear audit trail of the numbers can also be difficult.Spreadsheets also lack the range of functions that can be found only in tailor-made business software.Oxford University Press’s education and children’s division relied on manual and spreadsheet-based demand planning procedures, according to a case study by SAP. This made forecasting complex and time-consuming.Stock managers could not track buying patterns for each textbook, dictionary or novel, which made it difficult to forecast orders. This resulted in rush reprints to meet unexpected demand.The publisher considered a number of packages but opted for SAP’s Demand Planning tool.The most widely used spreadsheet package is Microsoft Excel, followed by Lotus 1-2-3, Apple Numbers and OpenOffice.org Calc. These programs are continually updated but small consultancies will “tidy up” the main packages.Resolver One is a package designed “for heavy number-crunching,” says Mr Thomas. “We have ways to put an overlay on your spreadsheet to show, for example, where there are numbers and where there is text.”Dashboards, which present the data in an easy-to-read format, can provide a quick overview of the most important information.“Dashboards are much more visual,” says Nigel Trapp, sales manager for global accounts at SAP. “The underlying data are possibly held in the spreadsheet, but it is not user-friendly and you get masses of tables and columns. I don’t see the spreadsheet fading away but it is not the only tool in the box.”“I’d be unhappy if a company was controlling its financials and its financial reporting through a spreadsheet,” comments Mr Meade.“It is too ad hoc, too easy to fragment. People find it too easy to add in cells or columns. Chief financial officers need more robust systems.”
215;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Competitive difference is in the analysis;;People, not computers, drive corporate strategy. But modern information technology is a vital tool in ensuring that plans are turned into reality.The workhorse of corporate IT systems is enterprise resource planning, an integrated computer-based system for managing internal and external resources. Now entering its third decade, ERP is being constantly updated as software suppliers and their corporate clients seek to make it more effective as a management tool.“Many organisations worldwide have successfully optimised their business processes by using ERP,” says Oracle, a leading supplier, in a plug for its latest ERP enhancement called enterprise performance management or EPM.It comments: “Most organisations have access to ample data on both the market and their internal operations. The competitive difference comes from the analysis, interpretation and actions based on this data.”The aim of these enhanced systems is to provide ever faster and more comprehensive information, to shorten financial reporting and planning cycles and to reduce the cost and complexity of managing IT.The challenge facing companies after the economic turmoil generated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers is to respond to increasingly volatile markets. They need to interpret the mass of data generated by IT systems and to respond effectively over ever-shortening timescales.“In the world we are in now, every company needs to run scenarios around their strategy,” says Andrew Meade, UK head of finance and performance management for Accenture, the consulting business. “You can’t make assumptions and hope they will work out.“IT allows you to compare actual outcomes with your forecasts and scenarios, pulling in outside sources of information alongside internal metrics and data. There is no real stability at the moment.“There are so many moving parts that understanding how they impact and what tweaks you need to make to strategy is really important.“If you are a global player, currencies can have a huge impact on the performance of your business,” Mr Meade says. “A manufacturing company may be heavily dependent on volatile inputs such as oil or metals. When the chief financial officer looks at his strategy, he wants to know what will be the impact on profitability from a shareholder point of view.”Faced with the mass of information generated by modern IT systems, companies are increasingly making use of “dashboards” to present the most vital data in an easy-to-read format.“You acquire the information on production, stocks and customers and create a dashboard that allows you to do the executive planning in the boardroom,” says Nigel Trapp, sales manager for global accounts at SAP, a software group.The screen shows top-level information in the form of bar charts and dials like the dashboard of a car but allows users to “drill down” to the data the screen presentation is based on, to query assumptions and gain a fuller knowledge of developments.One client – an oil company – makes use of dashboards in its central control room to monitor production volumes at different rigs in real time.“Companies that don’t use this technology may have to wait several months for the information,” says Mr Trapp.“Companies that do, can manage daily operations and set strategy. They can see which direction they are going in and whether they are creating value and adjust plans accordingly.”A key feature of IT management systems is their ability to bring together managers across dispersed locations. “The best systems allow people to bring together ideas and objections on a particular topic,” says Jean-Claude Delcroix, vice-president for research at Gartner, an IT consultancy.Large companies have traditionally had the need and the resources to install complex IT systems, but suppliers are attempting to extend their use to smaller businesses.SAP is targeting the small and medium-sized sector with Business ByDesign, making use of the internet to provide a low-cost business management tool.“Big companies will have IT departments and data centres and make use of large numbers of consultants,” explains Mr Trapp. “Smaller companies don’t want that. This provides the same business processes to anyone with an internet connection.”As mobile devices become more sophisticated, they offer the opportunity for companies to put sales people and service engineers in immediate touch with the head office computer.Partners in a supply chain and customers can check on stocks and the progress of orders. “Information locked up in the back office is of no use to customers,” says Mr Trapp.Despite these attempts to make ERP and other business management systems more widely available, many companies are still failing to employ the latest technologies or are not using them effectively.“More than 35 per cent of the top 5,000 global companies will regularly fail to make insightful decisions about significant changes in their business and markets” in 2012, because of a lack of information, processes and tools, according to a report last year from Gartner.
216;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-12-02T17:49:13Z;Tata unit joins call-centre rush to Philippines;;India’s Tata Consultancy Services launched its first call-centre in the Philippines on Thursday. The move reflects Indian outsourcing companies’ shift to transfer more basic services offshore as they focus on developing more value-added products at home.The decision of the big Indian group to open a business process outsourcing centre in Manila also reflects the rise of the Philippines as a global centre for call-centre services, according to sector experts.“Indian companies are moving a lot of their basic back office operations outside India and they are focusing on delivering more sophisticated software-based outsourcing products,” said Sudin Apte, principle IT analyst at Offshore Insight.“Among the countries picking up a lot of the businesses that was traditionally done in India, the Philippines is the one growing the fastest,” said Mr Apte.BPO revenues in the south-east Asian country have been increasing by 46 per cent a year since 2004 and are forecast to hit $9bn this year, making it the second largest market after India, which generates about $12bn inr annual revenues, according to the Filipino and Indian industry lobbies. “Manila is already an important centre for BPO,” said N. Chandrasekaran, chief executive of TCS. “Many of our customers show interest in the Philippines as the country has a big labour pool, so we decided that we should expand there.”Although India’s IT software outsourcing and BPO industry remains by far the biggest in the world, generating $60bn in revenues – $48bn and $12bn respectively – the Philippines’ BPO sector is expected to overtake India’s BPO sales by 2012, according to Everest Global.The Philippines’s BPO operations are forecast to expand by 30 per cent annually over the next five years. The Indian market, meanwhile, is expected to expand by about 12 per cent annually as companies in Mumbai and Delhi focus more on software and less on call-centre business.The Philippines produces almost half a million college graduates a year, creating a steady supply of potential recruits for the industry which already employs an estimated 520,000 Filipinos.Generous tax breaks have also helped attract more than 600 outsourcing companies to locate in the Philippines, among them IT service providers such as Accenture and IBM. Multinationals such as HSBC, and Deutsche Bank have also set up back office operations in the country.
217;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-12-01T02:22:37Z;European insurers expect to meet new rules;;The vast majority of European insurers expect to be fully prepared for the region’s new capital regime in two years’ time, according to a survey, though a number of large groups are calling for delays or an extended transition period to comply with the rules.The new rules, known as Solvency II, are meant to better match the capital that insurers hold with the risks they take.Eighty-two per cent of European insurers told Accenture, the consultancy group, in a survey due out on Wednesday, that they expected to meet the deadline by 2012, while 53 per cent of respondents said they definitely would.However, Munich Re, the German reinsurer, has called for companies to be given five years from 2012 to meet the new rules fully, while others have said they expect the rules to require further significant changes and testing before they can be implemented.Karel van Hulle, commissioner for insurance and pensions in Brussels, has insisted there will be no delay to the planned implementation of the rules at the start of 2013.Insurance companies across Europe have just completed a full test run of the regime to help the European Commission understand how it will affect their capital requirements.The industry has complained that the principles behind the rules have been distorted as regulators became overly cautious after the financial crisis.The results of the test run – known as Quantitative Impact Study 5 – will not be published until February or March, but the Accenture survey showed that most companies expected to have to hold more capital.Two-thirds of life assurers, 61 per cent of general insurers and 57 per cent of composites, which combine life and non-life, expect their capital requirements to increase, according to the survey. Fewer than one in five life assurers and about one in eight non-life insurers expect requirements to shrink.In what seems a contradictory response, all companies said they expected either moderate or significant benefits in terms of capital efficiency and management.Eva Dewor of Accenture said that while the costs of hitting the deadline may be increasing, no one should be surprised by Solvency II. “The time to prepare has not been short,” she said. “There could be scope for a longer transition period, but there have been no signals for that yet.”Many insurers are unhappy about this because banks have until 2019 to meet the new Basel III capital requirement rules.Almost 30 per cent of those surveyed expected their costs to comply with the new rules to exceed €25m ($32m) and 7 per cent expected to spend more than €100m. This compares with expectations three years ago when only 4 per cent expected to spend more than €25m.Apart from IT spending, human resource costs have been increasing dramatically as companies scramble to pin down the limited number of people with the right skills. Actuaries have seen their salaries rise dramatically, according to recruitment consultants.ReThink Recruitment, a technology specialist, said IT salaries for the Solvency II project are up by 50 per cent, with contractors able to command £900 per day.
218;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-11-28T08:06:46Z;Sustainability’s stumbling blocks;;"There is much talk of sustainability among the corporate community, but whatever action company directors decide to take on this front is rarely driven by shareholder pressure.This much was evident from the presentation of Unilever’s sustainable living plan earlier this month. Paul Polman, chief executive, announced three goals the company aims to achieve: to halve the environmental footprint of its products; source 100 per cent of its agricultural products sustainably; and help 1bn people improve their health and wellbeing.But in discussing how this would be achieved, there was no mention of financial issues, as FT columnist Michael Skapinker also observed (“ Corporate plans may be lost in translation ”, November 22).When asked how he would sell the plan to investors, Mr Polman more or less dismissed this as irrelevant. Consumers and retailers want this type of initiative, and the planet needs it, he said. He was not interested in whether this became a competitive advantage; it was just “the right way to do business”. He acknowledged the need to “do a good job of attracting the right investors”, but was clear these were long-term investors prepared to look beyond the latest earnings announcements.Mr Polman’s attitude does not surprise the investment community. He is habitually intolerant of investors with a short-term focus, and has been known to evict hedge fund analysts from presentations, I am told by one fund manager.This particular manager is more interested in Unilever’s competitive position now than its long-term goals, though, revealing he had sold his position on a view that the company was losing out to competitors in key emerging markets.Given the pressures on fund managers to outperform, it is no surprise he made this decision. But it confirms Mr Polman’s view that he should not look for universal support from investors in taking this step.Most chief executives report a lack of interest in sustainability activities from investors and analysts, according to a survey of 766 CEOs by Accenture for the 2010 United Nations Global Compact. Only 12 per cent cite pressure from investors as being a factor in driving them to take action on sustainability issues. By comparison, 72 per cent cite brand, trust and reputation.One European business leader told Accenture: “The real pressure, which isn’t there at all, is investor pressure.”This is somewhat surprising given the 213 asset owners and 465 investment managers that have signed up to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment. Perhaps investors are about to make their presence felt, but that is not what CEOs anticipate, with only 22 per cent identifying investors as one of their most influential stakeholders over the next five years.Most believed that even if sustainability performance was measured at the corporate level, investors would not make use of the information in valuation models.Clearly, there are difficulties in assessing companies on the basis of their environmental, social and governance performance. The drive to integrated reporting, discussed on page 12 (“Putting people, planet and profit into the annual report”) may help, but in the meantime, says Richard Stathers, head of responsible investment at Schroders, incorporating sustainability factors into current valuation models is a challenge.More effort is needed on both sides. The Accenture report said businesses needed to “track the impact of sustainability on core metrics and become more proactive in shaping the attitudes and mindsets of investors”.There are plenty of ratings on the non-financial performance of companies, relating to carbon footprints, water use and so on. But it is not clear how useful these are to investors, or anyone else. Recent work by SustainAbility, a consultancy, concluded there were too many rating schemes measuring similar things in different ways; that many ratings did not properly consider the context of certain companies, industries and issues; paid insufficient attention to the economic factors; and “fail to truly reflect how companies are positioned to contribute to a sustainable future”.Maybe in the end investors will just get pulled along in the wake of events. Walmart woke up to the issues posed by climate change when it lost over 100 stores in Hurricane Katrina, says John Elkington, chairman of Volans. Mr Polman is responding partly to pressure from retailers like Walmart, which are increasingly acting as market gatekeepers, he adds.It looks for now as if companies will be driven more by these factors than by investors. Odd really, given that the people they invest for are the same customers shaping the demands of retailers.pauline.skypala@ft.com"
219;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-11-26T00:38:21Z;Welfare list upsets voluntary sector;;Thirty-five organisations have qualified to supply the government’s plans for a hugely expanded welfare-to-work programme, a move that has achieved the coalition’s aim of bringing in big private service companies to the field.But the list has left voluntary sector providers, which often have the highly specialised skills needed to get people with mental health, physical and addiction problems back to work, fearing they will lose out on the programme again.The list of entrants among the providers, which will need deep pockets if the government goes ahead with its plans to pay them only on results, include Balfour Beatty working with Remploy, Atos Origin,G4S, and PwC working with a consortium of social enterprises.But some big names appear not to have made it, including Accenture, Babcock Enterprise, Capgemini, PA Consulting and Calder, the Dutch-owned welfare-to-work specialist.Stephen Bubb, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, said very few small voluntary organisations had qualified to be prime providers “despite the promises of Iain Duncan Smith and Chris Grayling [the work and pensions ministers] that they will have a big part to play”.He added: “Our worry is that they will be there only as subcontractors, with the prime providers taking the big margin on the deals, leaving only the smallest margins for those who have the real expertise on local estates to help those who need the most help to get back to work. That is what happened under the last government. We fear it is going to happen again.”Kirsty McHugh, chief executive of Ersa, the welfare-to-work trade body, said the big question now was the terms of contracts the government would offer. For example, how much was it prepared to pay up front to help people into work, and how long would people have to be in work before contractors were paid in full?She said that while providers backed pure “payment by results” for the longer term, they still felt “some sort of soft start or exploratory fee” would be needed, despite ministers’ insistence they wanted payment only on results.The employment department said those details would emerge “before Christmas”.
220;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-11-13T00:08:12Z;A case for consultants?;A fascinating study is proving how modern management techniques are helping improve productivity;"Management consultants don’t have the most stellar reputation for offering value for money – although, truth be told, the infamy of investment bankers has long since left them in the shade – so I was impressed when, early this year, rumours reached me of a fascinating new study in which a consulting firm was implicitly agreeing to subject its advice to a randomised trial.Not to put too fine a point on it, that’s a ballsy decision. Almost the only people who ever agree to test their stuff in a randomised trial are the pharmaceutical companies, and I am fairly sure they’re underwhelmed by the experience.Perhaps Accenture (for it was they) didn’t realise what they were letting themselves in for. After all, the study – conducted by a team of economists at the World Bank, Berkeley and Stanford – was ostensibly about whether modern management techniques would improve the productivity of large textile firms in India. (A draft, “Does Management Matter? Evidence from India”, is available from the website of co-author Nick Bloom at Stanford.) But how do you improve management techniques? You send a management consulting firm in.The researchers hired Accenture to provide management consulting services to 14 factories in Mumbai, chosen at random from a group of 20. The other six factories served as a control group and received a diagnostic performance audit but little serious advice. The World Bank and Stanford paid Accenture at a heavily discounted rate; the factory owners paid nothing.The results were undeniably impressive. The effect of a few months of consulting advice was that profits rose by almost a fifth, to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars a year. (The latest draft of the study puts the figure at $230,000; an earlier calculation reckoned it was even higher.) Output was up, inventory was tighter and defect rates were halved.Accenture’s fees for the five-month consulting gig, at commercial rates, would have been roughly the same amount as the increase in profits – so the arrangement would have paid for itself by the end of the year. If any of the consulting advice stuck, this would have been a fantastic investment. The indications are that the advice more than sticks: the new procedures generate more information, more ideas for running a tight ship, and a spiral of continuous improvement.But before we all rush out to hire a management consultant, two notes of caution. The first is that as the experiment was designed to evaluate management techniques rather than consultants, Accenture was left in charge of collecting its own performance data. (The data was subject to some independent checking, however, and there is no evidence that anything was amiss.)The more substantial caveat is that textile companies in India have their own distinct problems: tools and machinery were left lying around, and stock control was frequently non-existent. If a worker needed to find a particular item, the technique of choice was to forage around in the storage bins until something useful emerged. Modern inventory-management techniques made a big difference in this particular sector of Mumbai’s economy, but that does not mean that Vodafone or Barclays or the civil service have as much to gain from bringing the consultants in.Nick Bloom and his colleagues have also studied management practices across the world, and Brazil, China and India rank poorly. Just imagine what these emerging giants will do once they get the consultants in.As for whether management consultants can earn their keep in London or New York – I don’t know the answer. But I know a few economists who would happily supervise a randomised trial.Tim Harford’s latest book is ‘Dear Undercover Economist’ (Little, Brown)"
221;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-11-12T12:49:06Z;Something for the weekend;Working around a problem in your organisation, rather than reporting it to your manager could create long-term issues that lead at best to wasted resources and in some cases significant errors;Any individual in the workplace has come across “ the workaround culture” problems you encounter during the course of your working day, which you manage to navigate, successfully to do your job. However you do not tackle the existing problem and are forced to work around it again the next time you encounter it.Anita Tucker, associate professor of business administration in technology and operations management at Harvard Business School, has identified types of workaround cultures in a study of nurses at leading hospitals in the US. While these workarounds - such as borrowing medical equipment from another unit - work in the short term, in the longer term they can lead to medical errors, wasted resources - the time taken to locate and return the equipment and contribute to employee burnout, says Prof Tucker.It can also she adds, create an established workaround culture in the organisation, which can in turn prompt people to dismiss the idea of trying to improve the situation and lead them instead to learn to live with the problem.Prof Tucker’s research identifies an organisation’s policies and managerial behaviour as at the root of the issue. If a nurse believes that by alerting his or her manager to the problem it will be resolved then there is a greater chance that the problem will be reported. However, if the nurse feels under-valued and works in an organisation where managers have no interest in hearing of, or trying to resolve problems, the nurse is unlikely to report the problem and will instead continue to work around the issue.The workaround culture: the unintended consequences of organisation heroes, was published on Nov 5.IT- information technology - is becoming increasingly critical for successful global operations, with innovation being the watchword. But according to new research by academics, published in the MIT Sloan Management Review, chief information officers can no longer rely on tried and test managerial tools to deliver innovative results.The key to success say the writers is to have networks of informal collaboration which can often produce solutions “through informal and unplanned interactions”. This is due say the writers to the fact that individuals will look at the same problem with different perspectives.Moreover, such collaborations often do not slot easily into an organisation’s established processes and structures and so may be less visible to senior managers.By analysing these networks and discovering how individual employees and teams connect, as well as designing information networks to make the most of the flow of good ideas, managers can create global IT organisations “that are more efficient and innovative than organisations that rely primarily on formal mechanisms,” say the writers.The paper “The collaborative organisation, how to make employee networks really work” was written by Rob Cross, associate professor of management at the University of Virginia’s McIntire School of Commerce, Peter Gray, an associate professor of commerce at the McIntire School, Shirley Cunningham, chief information officer at Monsanto, Mark Showers, chief information officer at Reinsurance Group of America and Robert Thomas, executive director at Accenture’s Institute for High Performance.
222;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-11-11T18:27:16Z;Moody & Poor ... but Ireland is rich in humour;;"Is there anything funny to be said when a fifth of a nation’s economy is wiped out?One of Ireland’s most prominent economic commentators and the organiser of its largest comedy festival plan to find out this weekend after inviting stand-up comedians and international economists on to the stage to help explain how the Celtic Tiger’s miracle turned into a tragedy.The event will hopefully be “like Davos but with a sense of humour”, says David McWilliams, a former economist at the Irish central bank turned writer and columnist.Mr McWilliams set up the Kilkenomics festival in Kilkenny with Richard Cook, who runs the successful Cat Laughs event. They hope to use comedy to cut through the jargon of the financial crisis and open up economics to lay people.“Economics is far too important to be left to economists,” said Mr McWilliams.Acts will include a former Argentine minister of finance, a crusading US banking regulator and comedians from popular Irish TV show Father Ted.Colm O’Regan, a stand-up and former Accenture management consultant performing at the festival, said he hoped to use jokes to crack open the murky world of finance.Mr O’Regan has also named a new body to rate Irish debt: Moody & Poor (see image), which he describes as “a very Irish credit rating agency”. With panel discussions ranging from “What the hell just happened?” to “The best way to rob a bank is to own one”, via lighthearted takes on the Irish government’s bad bank and its plans for huge spending cuts, Kilkenomics aims to fill a hole in the public understanding of Ireland’s recession.For example, Mr O’Regan said there was wide confusion about the acronyms and terms bandied about during this most complex of crises. “We’ve been downgraded from AAA+ to AA-,” said Mr O’Regan. “What does that even mean? Before, we were a battery for the remote control; now we’re only good for a Walkman?”The attempt to draw the confused public into the debate is among a number of forays internationally to turn the financial crisis into art. In Iceland, the Reykjavik City Theatre this year gave a nonstop reading of the Icelandic parliament’s 2,000-page report into its banking crisis, and a stand-up comedian recently became mayor of Reykjavik after his satirical “Best party” won the city election.In the US, comedian Jon Stewart led an estimated 200,000 strong “Rally to Restore Sanity”, while his colleague Steven Colbert, a mock rightwing firebrand, fronted a “March to Keep Fear Alive” in response to political hysteria seen as a byproduct of the economic insecurity caused by the recession."
223;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Supply chain: Useful cuts – to wasted time and materials;;Computers have transformed the number-crunching aspects of the finance director’s job in recent years. In today’s volatile markets, the ability to provide accurate and timely information on the state of the business and its finances is even more vital for survival.“Transaction processing is not the most engaging part of finance,” says Andrew Meade, head of finance and performance management for consultancy Accenture in the UK and Ireland. “But it is a fundamental process so the company can pay its vendors and collect its cash. The fact that modern accounting systems do what they do so well at speed allows the chief financial officer to focus energy on other things.”Before the development of accounting or treasury management systems it could take a company months to close its books on a reporting period. It can now complete the process in two to three days.Manually recorded data were also more susceptible to error with the result that resources might not be deployed to greatest effect and planning assumptions could be compromised.Accounting systems began to emerge in the late 1980s when company treasurers started to realise the potential of the software. “There were the big systems that the banks used but there was nothing for corporates to use apart from spread sheets,” explains Ken Lillie, founder of Lillie Associates.“Treasurers decided to write their own. They concentrated on managing risk and cash but these became very powerful systems with a lot of experience built into them.”Some companies continue to use proprietary systems but most make use of the accounting functions available in enterprise resource planning software provided by the likes of SAP or Oracle. Other leading providers include SunGard and Wall Street Systems but there is a host of smaller ones.For some smaller companies a cash management facility provided by their bank is adequate.Finance and treasury heads can opt to install internal systems with varying degrees of customisation to their needs or sign up for what is known as “software as a service” – SaaS – which makes the product available on demand over the web and avoids the need to install and maintain the system in-house.The move from the manual collection of data to computers has relieved finance departments of a considerable burden but it is only a means to an end.“Finance needs to be a ruthlessly efficient transaction engine that provides the capacity and the time to focus on the commercial decision-making.” says Mr Meade.“These systems allow you to run the analytics in real time and be more scientific about where your business and your customers are heading.”But treasury management systems do not function in a vacuum, he warns. They need to be backed up by the right processes, systems, policies and organisational support.The in-house accounting management system will have a lot of interfaces with outside systems run by the company’s banks, suppliers and customers. In choosing a system, the finance director and treasurer need to be certain that it will allow seamless links with these outside organisations. Staff will need to be trained.And glitches can occur with even the best products. Something as simple as the different financial terminology used in various accounting jurisdictions can cause confusion. “You don’t want to have to guess what something means because the financial language is different,” says Mr Meade. “If everyone is not using the system in the same way, speed of aggregation and transparency are reduced.”Systems that have been in place for some time can start to show their age.“Many treasurers still use systems that were initially sound but, over the course of time and with the increased demands now placed on them, many are now be found wanting,” Mr Lillie wrote in The Treasurer magazine.“Workarounds may have been implemented in the form of home-built extras or the acquisition of third-party systems, perhaps on a piecemeal basis and without proper integration or planning.”Mr Lillie advises finance directors to review their technology every three to five years both to check it is still performing well and to assess what has come on to the market since. “People tend to think: ‘If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.’ But it is good discipline to review the technology on a regular basis.”The credit crunch and subsequent financial turmoil have put a premium on companies managing their money in an effective and timely manner.Counterparty risk has become a concern for finance directors in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This makes accounting systems that track a company’s exposure to individual banks even more important.More volatile markets mean finance directors must keep an even closer eye on their exposure to the foreign exchanges, interest rates and the derivatives they use to hedge exposure. “Instability is the new normal,” says Mr Meade.
224;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-10-25T00:45:48Z;How to design an executive MBA project;;"The EMBA project is the pièce de résistance of the degree, an opportunity for students to showcase the skills they have learnt.If they get it right, it can often lead to a promotion or positive career change. Projects can cover any subject. Sarah Dixon, dean of Bradford Business School, has supervised work that has ranged from devising internal reviews, such as “Product Portfolio Rationalisation: Options for Strategic Advantage” (a study of a telecoms organisation), to international business analysis – “Corporate Learning and Renewal in an Australian Grocery Wholesaler”.According to Dixon, the most important thing is that students are interested in the subject they choose, which should be realistic in scope and enhance their careers. It can be easy to settle on an area you are familiar with, she says, but students should seek to use projects that are challenging and achievable as additional EMBA collateral.Projects can relate to students’ employers or a new business venture. The choice these days depends on the individual, explains Steve Seymour, director of MBA programmes at Ashridge Business School. Until three years ago, consulting projects were the norm, he says, particularly where companies were sponsoring a student’s EMBA. But since then, more and more students have self-funded and are keen to develop entrepreneurial projects.Yusuf Chadun, for example, an alumnus from Ashridge, initially considered doing a consulting project for Accenture and then Dell, the companies for which he was working. But he found opportunities limited and decided to design a venture that grew out of his personal circumstances, bringing up a small child while working. The result was Third Door, a flexible office space with a communal social area and on-site childcare, which he has since turned into a successful business.Chadun says the first question he asked was one all students should: “Is there a need for it in the market?” It turned out there was indeed a need for such a workspace, with nothing of its kind in the UK. He was awarded a distinction.Once the subject of your project is shown to be feasible, the best way forward is to “get your hands dirty”, says Seymour. Use the tools the EMBA has given you, rather than “leaving them rusting”. Students should take advantage of all resources available – their network, for example. They could interview colleagues, fellow students, academics and industry experts. If consulting, try to access senior managers. And at business school, there is plenty of faculty supervision available.Textbooks, the internet and electronic data are also vital resources; the more variety, the better. Chadun, for example, attended the Baby Show at Earls Court in London to interview prospective clients, used SurveyMonkey.com (a free online questionnaire tool) to reach more people, and consulted childcare experts. He also took an entrepreneurship module at his school.Finally, there are pitfalls when designing a project: do not get too set on an initial plan, as circumstances may change suddenly within an organisation – a boss leaving, for example.Students should be prepared to turn ideas upside down if necessary, and think on their feet. They should also avoid writing a merely descriptive project with no projections or solutions. “A final report based on ‘I’m sure it will work’, without adequate demonstration of real research [will not work],” says Bertrand Moingeon, vice-dean of the Trium Global Executive MBA programme. He also highlights the importance of not breaching company confidentiality, which can occur if legal considerations are not respected during research.Dixon says the ideal project for the student, the supervisor and the company (if it is involved) is a “win, win, win”. The company gets a better understanding of a business issue, the student gains a step up the career ladder and the supervisor gains information that pushes the boundaries of research. Moingeon, meanwhile, describes an ideal project as one that has the potential to be successful in both financial and social terms.Whichever direction students choose to take, their projects will be seen as a direct reflection of their acquired knowledge, so it is vital to ensure this is showcased."
225;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-10-03T21:25:25Z;Schools ignore sustainability revolution;Recruiters must tell careers services that a sustainability mindset is expected in MBAs;"According to a report by Accenture for the 2010 United Nations Global Compact study of chief executive officers, 93 per cent of global CEOs believe sustainability issues will be critical to the future success of their business and 96 per cent believe sustainability issues should be fully integrated into the strategy and operations of a company.Now, a report produced by a taskforce led by Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, for Business in the Community in the UK, looks at leadership skills for a sustainable economy. In his foreword to the report, the Prince of Wales, BITC’s president, says leading businesses should “persuade business schools of the vital importance of imparting such skills to their students”. The study found that CEOs believe educating managers would be one of the key factors driving a tipping point to sustainability.Some individual faculty and business schools have already recognised the importance of inculcating new management skills for sustainability. Yet overall, for organisations that pride themselves on spotting trends and creating break-through thinking, business schools globally appear surprisingly slow to spot the extent of the sustainability revolution and the challenges and opportunities it creates.There are more than 10,000 business schools worldwide. Just 326 have signed up for the UN Principles of Responsible Management Education. Only 60 schools are members of the Academy for Business in Society and 40 are in the Global Responsible Leadership Initiative. Just 149 schools entered the last Aspen Institute’s Beyond Grey Pinstripes biennial rankings.Part of the problem is the emphasis for academic career progression on publication in three- and four-starred academic journals which can encourage incremental development of academic theory. Sustainability and corporate responsibility, by contrast, demand inter-disciplinary work, lowering the silos of traditional management disciplines; active interaction with business; and the development, real-time of management skills such as stakeholder-engagement and cross-sectoral partnership building.But business should not give up on business schools. Instead, it should use the levers it has to promote change within business schools.Companies need better internal join-up to ensure that corporate heads of talent development and executive learning are explicitly specifying sustainability leadership skills when buying customised executive development from business schools.Corporate recruiters must tell careers services that sustainability mindset, behaviours and skills are expected in the MBAs they hire. Better still, recruiters should specify the kind of changed mindsets they are looking for.Business leaders and senior managers who are engaged in organisations such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and BITC will themselves frequently be business school alumni and may well be active on business school advisory councils and alumni associations and regular guest speakers in the schools.They need to share with faculty the practical sustainability challenges they face and what is needed. They should also share their experiences about embedding sustainability, by giving access to students and researchers to produce teaching cases and longitudinal studies and discussing these issues when speaking on campus. More businesses need to join initiatives such as Eabis and support projects that advance practice and research simultaneously.Taking sustainability more seriously has to rest with deans and schools’ executives. If they do not, other organisations will fill the void for teaching sustainability skills. As Etienne Davignon, the former vice-president of the European Commission, told the inaugural meeting of Eabis in 2002: “If business schools do not start taking responsible business seriously, companies will not lose interest in the topic. They will lose interest in the business schools.”David Grayson is director of the Doughty Centre for Corporate Responsibility at the Cranfield School of Management, UK.www.ft.com/soapbox"

G…………………………………………………………………………………………………………Anon: OBITUARY FROM THE FINANCIAL TIMESMartin Lukes, the thought leader’s thought leader has died suddenly at the age of 50. Mr Lukes became the iconic businessman of his age and was influential in developing many popular management practices. He initially shot to fame for rebranding the US-based global group A&B as a-b glöbâl. The revolutionary use of accents was subsequently copied by Arthur Andersen in its rebranding as Accenture.However, Mr Lukes’ most important contribution to management thinking was creovation – a combination of creativity and innovation – which was the basis of GE’s scheme, Ecomagination.Mr Lukes won multiple awards including BT Outstanding Individual Contribution to Work-Life Balance 2004 (runner-up) and Best Change of DNA in Outsourced Space 2003, sponsored by Hyatt Regency.Never afraid of attracting controversy, Mr Lukes was arrested on a charge of insider dealing and served a two-year prison sentence but was released when the charge was overturned on a technicality.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………Janice Meyer:At KTT we all miss a great colleague!…………………………………………………………………………………………………………Sherril Lukes:How DARE you contaminate this condolence wall, you total tart.

You have no idea how he suffered as a result of YOU, what you did to his self-esteem, and your last attempt to rob him, insult him and do him for libel. YOU caused his death ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………Anon: FROM THE TIMESThe mystery surrounding the death of controversial thought leader Martin Lukes deepened yesterday as police declined to rule out foul play over a parachute that failed to open during a corporate skydiving event. “We are pursuing various lines of inquiry but cannot comment further at this moment in time,” said Detective Chief Inspector Marsh of the Kent police.Previously, people close to Lukes had suspected suicide, referring to his low spirits, and to a final tweet that read: “There is no opposite to Life. It just always is.”Yesterday, several people were believed to be helping police with their inquiries: Sherril Lukes, Martin Lukes’s widow; Jenny Withers, his former wife; a former colleague from KTT, Janice Meyer and Ms Meyer’s husband Jon Meyer. Oliver Warner and Kiara Sanchez are also believed to have been questioned.“He had a lot of enemies,” said a friend of Martin Lukes, who asked not to be named. A week before his death, Lukes was suspended from KTT following disclosure of e-mails referring to an illicit affair he had had with a member of staff. He had been asked to leave home by his wife. He was also being sued by former employee Mr Warner for unfair dismissal and by Ms Withers for libel.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………Martina, Tiger and Edelweiss Lukes:We love you daddy. Come back soon!!Mummy keeps falling over…………………………………………………………………………………………………………Sherril Lukes:Sorry if my earlier comments were over-emotional. This is a hard time for me, and I’m getting used to new meds …!…………………………………………………………………………………………………………Max Lukes:I have been praying for my father’s soul and struggling to understand what happened to him in his last days and hours.The idea that he took his own life is unthinkable to me. In his last tweet he said: “There is no opposite to Life, it just always is. No beginning, no end, so celebrate with body, mind, heart and soul. Woohoo!” This wasn’t a suicide note. It was a characteristically philosophical mind bullet.Equally, I reject the idea that anyone would have wanted to kill him. Even his enemies recognised that he was a good, intrinsically spiritual man at heart.I have reached the conclusion that what killed my father was technology and social messaging. He was a prophet of the socially networked age. Dad was proud of his vast following on Twitter and he was trying to communicate with them as he jumped from the aeroplane.Ultimately, I believe that he was a martyr to a cause he believed in. He died so that others can learn the lesson: you cannot tweet and operate a parachute at the same time.Dad, I know you are nestling in the arms of Our Lord. We will meet in a better place."
227;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-09-12T08:36:43Z;Recurrence ‘not only possible but likely’;;Investors in exchange traded funds could be forgiven for feeling a shiver of horror at the frank admission by American regulators that a recurrence of the US stock market’s “flash crash” of May 6 is not just possible but likely.The S&P 500 dropped 8.5 per cent in the flash crash, during which some companies saw their market value apparently evaporate entirely.Accenture shares temporarily sank to one penny, mistakenly reducing the market value of the consultancy from more than $26.8bn (£17.4bn, €21bn) to zero. ETFs, however, were affected more than any other class of securities by the flash crash.As traders became aware their screens were showing mistaken price quotes for individual equities, confidence in pricing levels for ETFs also evaporated. So market makers simply stopped trading ETFs and liquidity dried up.As a result, around 160 ETFs effectively lost all their value during the session while many more saw their prices drop by between 35 per cent and 100 per cent.US regulators classify these extreme movements as “broken trades”. Any trades that were done 60 per cent or more away from price levels before the flash crash were cancelled.ETFs account for about 30 per cent of trading volumes on US exchanges on any given day but they made up about 60 per cent of the “broken” trades that were subsequently cancelled on May 6.Small and mid-cap US equity ETFs were more affected than large-cap funds, possibly reflecting the higher volatility associated with trading smaller companies.But even in sectors that exhibited relatively modest volatility overall such as health care, industrials, natural resources and commodities, some individual ETFs lost 99 per cent of their value at their weakest point.“If you can’t calculate the value of the underlying asset, then you can’t calculate fair value for the ETF,” says David Fisher, chief executive of optionsXpress, the US broker. “But the flash crash doesn’t mean that ETFs aren’t good products or don’t have good liquidity.”The ongoing investigations into the causes of the flash crash have seen regulators debating the impact of high frequency trading and questioning the structure of US capital markets.Suggestions for reforms include proposals by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, that uniform “circuit breakers” should be introduced for stocks and ETFs across all exchanges.These would allow for a short break in trading if prices diverge wildly from previous levels.Noel Archard, head of US products for BlackRock, also told regulators the rules governing trade cancellations should be made less arbitrary and more transparent so as not to discourage market makers from providing liquidity in times of market stress.In addition, BlackRock called for clearer guidelines for how orders should be routed if there were problems at an exchange and suggested the role of lead market makers be expanded to ensure orderly trading.During the crash, some electronic market makers followed the example of lead market makers in stepping back from trading once erroneous quotes started to show on their screens, contributing to the overall loss of liquidity.Mr Fisher of OptionsXpress says regulators should consider raising obligations for market makers in equity markets to the higher standards currently required of market makers in futures and options markets.However, he cautions against making any new obligations too onerous. “If you put too many new obligations on market makers, there won’t be any left. Market makers cannot act as the guarantor of the market as they don’t have unlimited liquidity.”Mr Fisher's comments underline the difficulties facing US regulators, who are scheduled to publish proposals for reforms of trading rules in October.Whether these will be effective in restoring public trust in the integrity of US capital markets remains highly uncertain.
228;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-09-02T12:46:42Z;Capgemini taps into Brazil IT market;;Capgemini has placed a bet on Latin America, announcing on Thursday a deal to buy a majority stake in CPM Braxis, Brazil’s largest information technology services group.Europe’s largest IT services company is paying €233m ($298m) for a 55 per cent stake in Brazil’s CPM Braxis, a regional market leader. CPM Braxis has an enterprise value of about €437m.The deal will give Capgemini a platform to grow further in Brazil, where it will be looking to compete with rivals in the region such as Accenture, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Unisys.According to figures from Gartner, Latin America’s IT services market is worth about $23bn, with Brazil accounting for just under half of the total market. Brazil’s IT services market, which has seen the fastest rate of growth in the region, is projected to exceed 10 per cent a year in 2014.Capgemini joins a growing list of companies that have made acquisitions in Brazil this year as multinationals bet on the Brazilian economy, which is forecast to grow 7 per cent this year on the back of a huge boom in domestic consumption.The French group said that as part of the deal with CPM Braxis it has an option to buy the remaining 45 per cent of the company from the existing shareholders between three to five years after the deal is signed.CPM Braxis employs more than 5,500 people and is forecasting revenues for 2010 of €450m. The group is particularly strong in the financial sector, where the Brazilian lender Bradesco was its biggest client as well as being its largest shareholder before the Capgemini deal. The Brazilian group also has clients in telecoms, utilities and manufacturing.Paul Hermelin, chief executive, said the CPM Braxis deal was part of a wider growth strategy for Capgemini that would help the French group extend its presence in Brazil as well as supporting its existing global clients in the region.Capgemini already employs a few hundred people in Brazil and has businesses in Mexico, Guatemala, Chile and Argentina.Capgemini, which like others in the IT services sector, was hit hard by the global financial crisis is benefiting from a recovery in corporate investment.The group started hiring again at the end last year and increased its global headcount by 6 per cent during the first half of this year – mainly in emerging markets in Asia, eastern Europe, North Africa and Latin America.The French group said at its half-year results in July that it expects revenue growth of 3 to 5 per cent in the second of 2010 compared with the same period last year.Capgemini shares, which have risen about 4 per cent since the beginning of the year, were trading at €35.19 in early afternoon trading on Thursday.
229;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-08-31T23:19:00Z;NEC to offer cloud computing in China;;"NEC has agreed to set up a joint venture with Neusoft, China’s largest IT outsourcing provider, to offer cloud computing services in the country, the Japanese electronics company’s first move to offer such services outside its home market. The venture reflects high hopes among outsourcing services vendors that China will become a large market for them.NEC said it expected the nascent cloud computing market in China to grow to $2.3bn by 2012, expanding at an average pace of 30 per cent each year. The Chinese IT services market had revenues of $10.6bn last year and is forecast to grow to $20.6bn in 2014, according to IDC.In cloud computing, information is housed remotely by centralised providers rather than on users’ computers.The Chinese IT services market had revenues of $10.6bn last year and is forecast to grow to $20.6bn in 2014, according to IDC.Last year, IBM topped the ranks of IT service providers in China with a 6.1 per cent market share. The top five were rounded out by HP; Digital China, a company affiliated with Lenovo; Huawei, China’s largest network equipment vendor; and Accenture, the global services firm. Neusoft ranked 7th.Neusoft is the largest vendor in the offshore IT services segment, in which a growing number of Chinese companies are competing. They have been making inroads against their much larger Indian competitors, especially with South Korean and Japanese companies to which they are closer geographically and culturally than Indian firms.China’s position as the global manufacturing base for most electronics products has also aided Chinese outsourcing providers.Spurred by the massive employment generated in India and in the Philippines, the Chinese government is offering tax and other incentives to help develop the industry.Foreign vendors have also started piling into the market. Ning Wright, a partner in charge of KPMG’s China outsourcing advisory service, points to the growing number of research and development centres of multinational groups in China as one indicator.However, industry experts said the market would only fulfil its promise if large state-owned enterprises start embracing the idea of outsourcing. So far, state-owned banks and telecoms operators – some of the biggest potential customers – remain reluctant to share information, said the China head of a Western outsourcing company.“SOEs are certainly a core customer target group,” said Masaki Kidowaki, NEC China president, though he noted that privacy and security concerns were paramount for these enterprises.NEC has been trying to reduce its reliance on hardware manufacturing and reposition itself as a broad-based IT services group. Last year, for instance, it spun off its mobile phone handset business in a joint venture with competitors Casio and Hitachi.Japan’s sprawling electronics companies have all come under pressure to focus on a few core businesses, in the face of lower-priced competition from South Korea and China and disciplined rich-country rivals such as Apple of the US.Amid the gradual consolidation, NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu in particular have targeted the global IT market. Fujitsu is also moving into China with a new data centre near Guangzhou, which it expects to open next year.Wang Yongfeng, Neusoft president, said the cloud computing joint venture would target manufacturers with global export business in addition to Chinese small- and medium-sized enterprises who could save in IT expenses.The two companies said their joint venture, in which NEC will hold a 70 per cent stake and which will be based with Neusoft in Dalian, would start in October with 70 employees. The headcount is expected to increase to 200 within three years.Additional reporting by Jonathan Soble in Tokyo"
230;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-08-30T22:00:50Z;iEnergizer set to break trend with Aim float;The group is set to raise about £37m;iEnergizer, an Indian call centre operator and supplier of back office outsourcing systems, is set buck the trend on Aim towards delisting with a flotation in September to raise funds for an acquisition.The group is set to raise about £37m when it places nearly 32m shares at 116p on the junior market, giving iEnergizer a market capitalisation of £174m.Anil Aggarwal, chief executive and founder, is set to reduce his holding to about 80 per cent, to give him financial firepower and a higher profile as he pursues bolt-on acquisitions.Mr Aggarwal argued that, in a market dominated by large scale Indian and US businesses such as Wipro, Infosys Technologies, Accenture and IBM Global Services, iEnergizer needs to be bigger.“For 10 years I have run the business organically. Now it’s time to start looking at an acquisition. In coming months, we’ll look at a deal or two,” said Mr Aggarwal. “If we don’t make an acquisition, we won’t go to the next level.”Founded 10 years ago, iEnergizer processes higher-margin back office work such as cheques, mortgages and credit card transaction processing.Nearly half its revenue comes from the financial services industry, while a further 31 per cent comes from online gaming. About 20 per cent of its business is in voice-services such as call centres.The flotation is likely to be the largest on Aim in several months, bucking the trend that has seen companies depart London on a regular basis in the last 18 months. Analysts estimate that about 30 per cent of the market will have delisted since its peak in December 2007.Mr Aggarwal said he was considering expanding in new regions, such as Europe.The group will float without a finance director– although it intends to have one in place by Christmas. Sara Latham, one-time communications adviser to US president Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, has been appointed as non-executive chairman.Revenues for the year ended 31 March 2010 were nearly $34m (£22m) when profits of £11.3m were recorded. Mr Aggarwal said trading had continued in line with expectations. The group intends to pay dividends following admission.Trading in iEnergizer is set to begin on September 14. Arden Partners is acting as nominated adviser.
231;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-08-11T19:58:02Z;Warning that ‘flash crash’ could recur;;A repeat of the sudden stock market plunge that shocked investors in the US three months ago – the so-called “flash crash” – could easily happen again, the chief financial officer of consultancy Accenture warned on Wednesday.Testifying at a regulatory hearing in Washington on the crash, Accenture’s chief financial officer, Pamela Craig, said that while the firm recognised it was still not clear how the crash had been triggered, “we do understand that there was seemingly a ‘perfect storm’ of economic news around the globe, a reduction of liquidity in many securities, unusual trading volumes and some technology challenges”.“Based on what we have all witnessed in the markets that day and since then, there is every reason to expect that this can happen again,” Ms Craig told the hearing, hosted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the two markets regulators.It was the first detailed public comment by one of the companies whose shares were worst affected by the crash.Accenture shares fell to 1 cent from $40.01 in just 20 minutes, before recovering.The hearing, attended by Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, convened as regulators are still seeking answers on what caused the crash.They are concerned that the role of computer-driven trading and the fragmentation of share trading across up to 40 trading venues may have created an environment where markets can spin out of control. Bart Chilton, a CFTC commissioner, said: “There may in fact be an over-reliance on computer systems and high-frequency trading.”Chris Nagy, managing director of order routing sales and strategy at TD Ameritrade, one of the largest brokers handling orders from ordinary investors, said the crash had damaged investor trust in US equity markets.“It appears that the very nature of how the US markets are structured …the dispersed structure of markets and dependence on liquidity providers who have no [market-making] obligations – it’s clear that this has had an impact on psychology and trust in the market,” he said.Kevin Cronin, director of global equity trading at Invesco, an asset manager, echoed Ms Craig, saying: “We have a market that’s evolved to the point that it’s so electronic and there is so little communication between exchanges that this could happen again.”Ms Craig urged the SEC to expand a current “pilot” programme of circuit breakers on the S&P Index, which is being implemented by all exchanges and trading platforms.“If something similar to the [flash crash] happened again, investors could be deterred from investing in our company even though it would have nothing to do with the strength of the underlying business but instead be due to a market glitch.”
232;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-07-23T23:28:28Z;First Person: Jonathan R.Trappe;;People were amazed when, in May, I became the first person to fly across the English Channel under a large cluster of toy balloons. They compared me to the old guy in the movie Up. But this was real – there were dangers to address and it took many months to prepare.I first became interested in this form of flight the way most people do. When you see a balloon as a child, you start to wonder, “If I just got enough of these, couldn’t I go into the sky?” You’re usually told by sensible adults that this is not possible. I’m 37 now, but when I lift off in a chair attached to a towering cluster of helium-filled balloons, I see true amazement and wonder in the eyes of children and their parents.I’m American, and work as a technical projects manager for Accenture in Raleigh, North Carolina, but I wanted to fly the Channel because it is iconic – a classic challenge that has called to aviators for generations.We had to persuade governmental agencies that flying toy balloons from England to France could be done safely and legally. It took years to get the full co-operation of both the US and UK aviation authorities. It would be a lot easier to do this illegally, but I am committed to safety.The sport is not as solitary as it looks. There must have been 20 people on the airfield at Kent Gliding Club helping us that dawn in May, then another 80 specialists around the world, from our meteorologist in Wyoming to the ham radio specialists who helped us stay in touch.The balloons are bigger, stronger versions of what you might see at a party. The wind was strong, so after filling them from helium tanks we had to tie them all over the field before bringing the cluster together for takeoff.My crew chief is also my girlfriend, Nidia Ruiz Ramirez. As soon as I left she made for France by Eurotunnel. I’m a trained pilot. I’ve flown many times. Nevertheless, I was nearly overcome by emotion when I left the ground. Once I was free of the earth, I no longer battled the winds. When you are in the air in a balloon, the wind could be blowing at 50mph but it feels the same as 2mph. You move with the wind in silence, in tranquillity. All other aircraft make a terrible noise.There are currents of wind at different altitudes. Balloonists steer by climbing and descending, and selecting the most favourable current. I descended by popping balloons with a knife or cutting them free, and climbed by throwing off some of my ballast water.I was supposed to be chased by a helicopter, in case I went into “the drink”. Survival time after sudden immersion at that time of year is one or two minutes. But after two miles the helicopter was low on fuel, so it turned back to Gatwick.Then it really was silent. There I was, all support craft and radio contact gone. My crew was in the tunnel. I was out of reach of air traffic control. I couldn’t even hear the waves until I descended to 1,000ft. I was out in the open sky – I could feel it on my skin and in my lungs.Making landfall over the lighthouse at Dunkirk was an extraordinary feeling. Once over France, I initiated a sharp descent to avoid entering a restricted airspace at the border with Belgium. Just above the surface, I dropped ballast to reduce my speed of descent, and to clear some power lines, before releasing another batch of balloons and landing in a cabbage field a mile short of the border with Belgium. Nidia was there within five minutes. So were the police, but they were friendly.I did not have a big sponsor. This adventure cost me many thousands of dollars. But I believe in this form of travel. With the right sponsors, I will be able to fly the Pacific.For now, I have something to keep me warm when I’m old, and annoy grandchildren with. They’ll say: “Yes grandpa, you told us the story of the Channel already. Lots of times.”
233;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-07-22T22:01:20Z;May sacks Raytheon from e-borders contract;;Raytheon has been removed from its lead role overseeing a £750m project to provide a secure border control system for the UK after the British government said it had “no confidence” in the US defence and security company.The decision by Theresa May, home secretary, to end Raytheon’s involvement will cause delays in the e-borders project, part of government attempts to control immigration and improve security against terrorists.However, officials said the tough approach taken by ministers showed that the coalition government was far less willing than its Labour predecessor to put up with poor performance or delays on big contracts.The project was singled out for early attention by the cross-government “efficiency and reform group” headed by Francis Maude at the Cabinet Office and Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury.In unusually strong language for officials to use publicly about a contractor, harking back to the days when the Ministry of Defence and BAE Systems were engaged in open warfare, Damian Green, immigration minister, said: “The home secretary has no confidence in the prime supplier of the e-borders contract, which since July 2009 has been in breach of contract.”He added: “It has been clear for some time that the way the existing programme was developing gave rise to serious concern. Over recent weeks we have been examining progress and it has been extremely disappointing.”The Home Office said “critical” parts of the programme were a year behind schedule. The government faces a race to retender the project without causing more long delaysRaytheon said that: “We appreciate the Home Office is operating under significant budget constraints but a default notice is not an appropriate way to achieve the important objectives of this programme.”The scheme was meant to give border officials early access to electronic passenger details of all people coming into the UK, which could be checked against police, security and immigration watch lists. As well as technical delays, the project has been plagued by doubts about whether other countries would provide passenger information.The UK Border Agency said the scheme would show who was coming into or leaving the country, and how many, something missing from current UK immigration controls.The Home Office said Raytheon and its subcontractors, Serco, Detica, Qinetiq and Accenture, would continue on the project until a new prime contractor was appointed.The termination could open the way for BT, the telecoms group, to retender for the prime contract after missing out on the initial bid. However, people involved in the consortium said it was more likely that one of the existing junior members would take over.One executive at a consortium company said: “This is about a falling-out between Raytheon and the Home Office and about project management. It is not about the rest of us.”It was estimated by a person working on e-borders that the retendering would mean another delay of six months to a year.The previous government had claimed 95 per cent of UK passenger movements would be covered by e-borders by the end of this year, a target that will be missed by some distance.The Home Office said £188m had so far been spent on the £750m contract. Officials said no penalty fees would be paid because the contract was “terminated for cause”, including late delivery of important milestones such as a National Border Targeting Centre.
234;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-06-24T23:36:46Z;Regulation: Important staging post on road to Seoul;;The G20 meeting in Toronto is unlikely to result in significant breakthroughs on the regulatory front, but the behind-the-scenes conversation could be critical to shaping global reforms due to emerge this year.Most regulatory and political experts say decisions about how to make the financial system safer and deal with cross-border banks and other institutions seen as “too big to fail” will probably be taken in November in Seoul.“It will be a positioning meeting rather than a decision-making meeting,” predicts John Liver, partner at Ernst & Young. “Seoul is the key date in terms of finalising things.”But the leaders will be talking among themselves in Toronto about the timing and nature of these reforms, and the consensus – or lack of it – will help shape finance and banking for years to come.Steve Culp, global managing director for risk management at Accenture, says: “2010 will be critical, as it will determine whether the co-ordinated approach, agreed during last year’s G20 summits and related global finance sessions, solidifies the co-ordinated direction – or fractures.”Toward that end, the leaders will also be taking stock of how the participants have implemented prior agreements.Stephen Harper, prime minister of Canada and the host of the meeting, told the Financial Times: “We’re not looking for leaders to come and make a whole bunch of new commitments. We’re looking primarily for account­ability, that we act upon the agreements already reached.”The G20 leaders are unlikely to drill down too deeply into issues such as the quality of bank capital and forcing banks to write “living wills” that would make it easier to break them up in case of failure.Technical committees are working out these proposals, and politicians are unlikely to tinker with details at this stage.Giles Williams of KMPG explains: “The thing politicians don’t want to play around with are the preventative measures because they are too technical.”Several significant forces in the G20 are also in the midst of their own reforms.The US is finishing up a big financial reform bill. The UK’s new coalition government has just outlined its approach to financial regulation. And the EU is about to create several pan-European bodies to oversee systemic risk, banking, in­surance and markets. That uncertainty may also make it hard for the group to commit to specific reforms.“Either nothing happens or very little happens,” says Tom O’Riordan, of the law firm Paul Hastings.Instead, the G20 leaders will probably urge the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a global body of regulators and central bankers, to press ahead with proposals for tightening the definition of tier one capital and liquid assets, and reducing dependence on short-term funding.The committee is due to meet again in July and hopes to finalise its proposals in time for the G20 to consider them in Seoul.Hanging over the G20 discussion in Toronto will be growing concerns that if government spending cuts and increased regulation hit at the same time, the fragile recovery could be derailed.“If you are going to have capital stringency on top of government budget cuts, you have the recipe for a mini-crisis. It’s not something the market can bear,” says Mr O’RiordanThe Institute of International Finance, a banking group, unveiled a study this month which calculates that the Basel proposals could cut economic growth by 3 percentage points in the US, eurozone and Japan over the next five years.But some regulators say the impact will be much less, perhaps 1 point. The Basel committee expects to issue its own impact statement this year.Nout Wellink, chairman of the Basel group, says its study will include not only the costs of increased regulation, but also the benefits of a more stable banking system.“On the one hand, higher capital requirements and liquidity standards could increase the cost of funding. On the other hand, more stable, less leveraged banks would raise average ratings, improve the terms on which banks could raise funds, and lower the required return on equity,” he said in a recent speech.Some European leaders are expected to press for the rules to be watered down, while the US and UK are more likely to argue for keeping the tough rules but extending the transition period to blunt the impact.That debate remained unresolved when the finance ministers met this month, but Ernst & Young’s Mr Liver predicts the G20 leaders will try to be more definitive, at least on the timetable.“They will come up with some language that is more explicit on the transition period. There is going to be a tone of impatience,” he says.
235;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;CFTC chief eyes circuit breakers for safety;;Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said on Thursday that the regulator was exploring whether new circuit breakers that link futures, options and equities are required in the wake of last month’s “flash crash.”“May 6 was a volatile day in both futures and equities,” said Mr Gensler in remarks at an exchange conference in New York on Thursday.“We need to look at the interplay between markets and whether it’s appropriate to look at inter-market circuit breakers between futures and securities,” he said.Next week, a six-month pilot program of circuit breakers covering stocks in the S&P 500 will be launched and be respected by all US exchanges and alternative trading venues.The move represents the first regulatory action since the “flash crash” when stocks slumped and subsequently recovered inside a period of twenty minutes. Some blue-chip shares such as Accenture temporarily traded at just a penny, while thousands of trades were subsequently cancelled by the leading electronic exchanges.Both the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the futures and securities markets’ two regulators, are investigating the reasons for the market turmoil. In a recent preliminary report they stated there is no clear reason for the sudden surge of selling, and that they are investigating several possible causes.“A lot of work still needs to be done,” said Mr Gensler. He added that regulators are looking closely at the role of risk management by electronic traders and algos (algorithmic traders) before they place orders in the market.
236;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-06-03T15:59:55Z;Beyond carbon: Profligacy in a cup of coffee;;Walmart’s plan to extend carbon dioxide emissions reduction targets to its suppliers – aiming to cut 20m tonnes from its supply chain by the end of 2015 – indicates that, for some companies, climate change is integrated into corporate strategy.However, World Bio­diversity Day in May was a reminder that greenhouse gases are just one of a range of environmental impacts the corporate sector has to worry about.“There are different ways of looking at resource use, and it’s not just about energy,” says Dominic Searle, head of clean technology and renewable energy at RSM Tenon, a member of the global accountancy network RSM International.He cites the case of a cup of coffee and its water use. “The hundreds of litres it takes to produce that cup has an impact on the rest of the world, particularly in water-distressed areas where the beans are produced,” he says. “This message has yet to emerge, whether in financial markets or among individual consumers.”Among some companies, however, a more integrated approach is emerging. “We are seeing some great examples,” says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental groups.She cites the case of General Mills, and its strategy on water and other environmental impacts. In its Green Giant division, the US group has worked with growers not only to cut water consumption but also minimise use of agricultural chemicals for all its main crops, setting tangible goals in areas such as insecticide application on maize, where it aims to make a 30 per cent cut over three years.This integrated approach appears to pay off for companies. In research conducted by Accenture, the consulting firm, of Fortune 1,000 companies, it found that the 30 highest financial performers also did well on sustainability. “And almost all those companies are looking beyond pure carbon,” says Peter Lacy, who heads Accenture’s sustainability services practice across Europe, Africa and Latin America.Mr Lacy points to Diageo as an example of a company that has taken an integrated approach. In addition to establishing aggressive carbon targets, he explains, the company is also focusing on reducing water consumption, introducing sustainable packaging codes and coming up with alternative materials to reduce waste.However, the integrated strategy embraced by General Mills and Diageo is not being universally adopted. For water consumption alone, even among organisations espousing sustainability, not all companies are factoring consumption into their decision-making processes.Mr Lacy sees a 20-40-40 division of companies, with 20 per cent now very concerned about water resources and the extent to which they could threaten their cost base and operations in the short term.He believes 40 per cent may be aware of water as an issue but do not yet know what it means for their business, while another 40 per cent have not even considered water as a risk.Ms Lubber would agree. She argues that sustainability practices are often piecemeal and seen only in a small group of high-profile companies. “We have to move from anecdotal, one-off projects to systemic, strategic movements,” she says.A recent study commissioned by IFS, a software company focused on lifecycle management, found that nearly half of top executives admitted their company did not have technology to track its environmental footprint on a continual basis.Moreover, if the number of companies considering waste, water and other environmental issues in their business strategies is increasing, those addressing the full spectrum of their impact on natural resources remain in the minority.Few companies, for example, have an understanding of their impact on biodiversity or their business exposure to its loss.And yet – in the food and agriculture sector in particular – many rely on healthy ecosystems and biodiversity to prevent soil erosion and provide protection from storms. Diverse natural resources also provide raw materials such as crops for food and fibres for textiles.Some sectors, such as mining, have been forced to address biodiversity. Often as a result of activist pressure, companies have developed not only mitigation strategies to address their impact on biodiversity but also rehabilitation plans, particularly after closure of a mine or quarry.However, few other companies have yet considered their impact on biodiversity. “I’m not sure biodiversity has been thought through, either on the downside, in terms of the impact, or the upside in terms of how you can harness biodiversity, particularly in supply chains,” says Mr Lacy.He believes biodiversity and ecosystems will start to enter the corporate consciousness. “This will become increasingly central,” he says.“Particularly as a number of organisations are beginning to think about the broader environmental services impact of their business.”
237;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-06-02T18:07:25Z;Breaking circuit to halt repeat of ‘flash crash’;Most dramatic approach in trying attempt to curb volatile trading since 1987 crash;"Next week, in a bid to prevent a repeat of May’s “flash crash”, new rules for US equities are being introduced in the most dramatic attempt to curb volatile trading since market-wide price limits were introduced after the 1987 stock market crash.The changes represent the first policy response from the Securities and Exchange Commission since the turmoil on May 6 and will, in effect, subject all stocks in the S&P 500 to new speed limits.Investors are waiting to see how the market fares under the new regime during a planned six-month pilot period.The dynamics of how the circuit breakers are calculated should reduce the likelihood of many stocks being subjected to trading halts, analysts say.However, some are warning that the new rules will not prevent a repeat of the chaotic trading seen last month.During the “flash crash” some 55 S&P 500 stocks experienced price movements of 10 per cent or more from a sale in the preceding five-minute period between 2.41pm and 2.50pm, according to Execution Analytics & Compliance Solution.Shares in Procter & Gamble, the household products group, briefly fell 35 per cent; those of Accenture, the consulting group, slid precipitately from $40 a share to trade at the incredible price of just one cent at one point.The new circuit breakers on stocks have been designed to prevent such wild swings. They are based, in part, on the market’s current method whereby trading in a stock can be halted when there is news about a company pending.However, there are crucial differences to how circuit breakers are calculated, which the listing exchanges must monitor. With the new circuit breakers, halts are triggered based on where the price of the stock was trading during the previous five-minute period.This rolling reference price over five minutes has been designed so that the new circuit breakers are only triggered in extreme cases of market turmoil and do not disrupt daily swings in stocks based on specific company or sector news.“Circuit breakers should not be a daily occurrence, they are designed to be triggered under extreme circumstances,” explains Joe Ratterman, chief executive at Bats Exchange, one of the new upstart exchanges.However some traders argue that the new circuit breakers could favour the fastest computer trading systems as these systems will detect slightly ahead of others when circuit breakers are about to be triggered and will be able to take steps to protect themselves.Slower trading systems could be left with open positions in a halted stock.Other critics of the new circuit breakers dispute whether the new rules will prevent a repeat of the flash crash.Some caution that the new rules may even exacerbate problems.Jeffrey Rubin, director of research at Birinyi Associates, says after analysing the data from May 6, that “the adjusted Dow Jones Industrial Average would still have declined 500 points in five minutes despite the new rule”.He warns that should a stock approach the 10 per cent limit, people in the market may decide to step away and not run the risk of trading near that level. Should market liquidity thin under such circumstances, there is a risk that a stock’s price rises or falls much more than 10 per cent before the trading halt is called.There are also execution issues that still need to be ironed out.During the pilot period, other stocks and securities such as exchange-traded funds, outside the S&P 500 are likely to feature circuit breakers.“I think the move to include ETFs will happen quite quickly,” says Eric Noll, executive vice-president at Nasdaq OMX.However, a 10 per cent band may not be appropriate for less liquid stocks and ETFs.Despite these stumbling blocks, the move towards widespread circuit breakers appears unabated.On Wednesday, Nasdaq announced that it would be implementing its own price curbs for all stocks listed on the exchange. The Nasdaq Volatility Guard is designed to complement circuit breakers for S&P stocks and will start during the third quarter.Meanwhile, the NYSE trading floor will continue to operate its own curbs, known as Liquidity Refreshment Points, which apply to all its listed stocks and not just those in the S&P 500.The two main US equity exchanges where companies list their shares are NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX and they are doing the bulk of preparing the overall market for halting trading in specific stocks, when prices change dramatically.In contrast, BATS and Direct Edge, the other two main public exchanges which have risen to prominence in recent years, will only have to make small changes to their technology systems as news of a trading halt is initiated by the NYSE and Nasdaq.William O’Brien, chief executive of Direct Edge, says: “Everyone will look at how their systems operate when a trading halt is called on a stock by a listing exchange, and I think there will be little if any incremental changes to our technology in order to comply with the trading curbs.”Any halt in trading and subsequent restart will be governed by NYSE and Nasdaq, which are currently responsible for trading halts in a stock ahead of specific company news.They currently use auctions for the opening and closing of market prices, and this process will be used for re-establishing trading in a halted stock.The circuit breakers will run from 9.45am until 3.35pm and not cover big swings at the open and close, where stocks listed on NYSE and Nasdaq are subject to auctions designed to smooth out imbalances in trading.“We need to leverage some of our auction technology that is used for the market open and close, in order to be ready for the new rules,” says Joe Mecane, co-head for US listings and cash markets at NYSE Euronext."
238;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-06-01T19:52:20Z;Stock markets: That sinking feeling;Regulators look at perils in high-frequency trading;"When James Angel wrote to the Securities and Exchange Commission just over a month ago, he made a prescient point. “With so much activity driven by automated computer systems, there is a risk that something will go extremely wrong at high speed,” the associate professor of finance at Georgetown University warned the US equity market’s main regulator in a letter sent on April 30.It took only six days for the prediction to come true.On May 6, a Thursday, the mood on Wall Street was already negative: concerns about the Greek sovereign debt crisis and its impact on the euro meant US stocks were already down by about 5 per cent. But within seconds, just after 2.40pm, those falls had doubled or more. Shares in Procter & Gamble, the household products giant, fell 35 per cent; those of Accenture, the consulting group, slid precipitately from $40 per share to trade at the incredible price of just one cent.Traders were stunned. “We thought a big European bank was about to go under, that this was it,” says a dealer who was on one of the big trading floors at the time. “Everyone got on the phone. Then, traders quickly realised that the falls were due to lots of automated sell orders. At that point we all just wanted to reach for the emergency button and press stop.”While there have been times in equity markets where some stocks have moved wildly, the afternoon that has become known as the “flash crash” was the first time that the entire US equity market was convulsed by such turmoil.But 20 minutes later prices had bounced back. Trades that took place during that dramatic slice of the hour where the movement was more than 60 per cent were cancelled. Yet the impact of the flash crash will be felt for a long time to come, not least because it showed that the equity markets do not have such an emergency button, or any way to halt trading when something goes haywire.“The decline and rebound of prices in major market indices and individual securities on May 6 was unprecedented in its speed and scope,” said the SEC in a report on the saga. “The whipsawing prices resulted in investors selling at losses during the decline and undermined confidence in the markets.”On Wednesday, the regulator is hosting a day-long Washington debate on the topic, involving many leading industry participants. “All market reform will be looked at through the prism of what happened on May 6,” says William O’Brien, chief executive of DirectEdge, one of the four main public exchanges for US shares.The gathering comes as the issue of how markets function also rises up the agenda in Europe, where the German cabinet on Thursday meets to discuss proposals to ban so-called “naked” short-selling in German stocks – offering securities that one neither owns nor has agreed to borrow – as well as a ban on speculative derivatives on the 16-nation euro currency. In Brussels, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, is preparing a review of the liberalisation it introduced in share trading three years ago.Yet amid all this activity, it is still unknown exactly what sparked the breakdown in US share trading on that otherwise unremarkable Thursday. The search to answer this mystery is in full swing, with regulators ploughing through thousands of spreadsheets and tracking more than 19bn trades in equity and derivatives markets in the search for clues.One thing has been established: the SEC says it has found no evidence yet that the crash was the result either of “fat finger” errors, when a trader presses the wrong key or magnifies an order by misplacing a decimal point, or of computer hacking or terrorism.“The real shocker is that it was nothing nefarious that caused the crash,” says David Weild, senior adviser to Grant Thornton and former vice-chairman at Nasdaq. “It was acceptable investor behaviour – people trying to put on hedge transactions,” he believes. “The market had a mini-meltdown in an instance when it appears no one was intentionally trying to manipulate the market. It’s disturbing that it does not take a lot to cause these markets to cascade.”The ongoing autopsy of the US flash crash has implications way beyond Wall Street. Markets across the globe – particularly those that trade privately instead of through exchanges – are under intense scrutiny.Opacity in privately traded markets, such as in derivatives and complex securitised bonds, is widely seen as having contributed to the meltdown of the financial system in 2008 and the ensuing global economic crisis. Laws are being passed across the globe to force over-the-counter derivatives and other markets into the public eye.In many cases, stock markets have been hailed as the standard to live up to, for the ease with which investors can check stock prices and trade shares even when markets are volatile. “Our current equity markets are characterised by efficient and effective linkages and healthy competition among markets and market participants,” said the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association, which represents many large banks and brokers, in a letter to the SEC, also penned on April 30.During the 2008 financial crisis, trading in the equity markets “continued without a significant hitch”, Sifma points out. “This is in contrast to the liquidity freezes and instability that were evident in other markets (ie, the credit markets) during that time.”But the flash crash confirmed the suspicions of those investors and regulators who had long worried that complicated trading systems, fragmented trading across some 40 different venues, and the enthusiastic embrace of super-fast trading with computers spitting out thousands of buy and sell orders in microseconds, could threaten disaster.Indeed, the flash crash taps into a debate that has been simmering for years between those who see benefits created by the rapid advance of technology – by lowering barriers to entry for new participants and boosting liquidity for investors who wish to trade – and those who fear it has introduced unknown risks into the system.The events of May 6 revealed that while getting rid of old-style “specialist” market makers has reduced the cost of trading by narrowing bid-ask spreads, the benefit has come at a cost. Now, no one has an obligation to provide prices for all shares all the time during a trading day, as trading has fragmented across an array of electronic trading venues and traders. The moment the markets grow too risky, many new electronic market makers appear only too willing to head for the exit.Stitching venues together is a dazzling new way of trading that has become the engine for profits for many of the biggest exchanges and trading houses, powered by rapid-fire computer programs. Trades can be executed as fast as 250 microseconds – hundreds of times faster than the blink of a human eye.Trading volumes have soared as a new species, the high-frequency trader, has emerged – their computers spitting out thousands of prices and trading constantly during the day before retiring at the closing bell without, more often than not, holding any stocks.This shift is not unique to the equities business. Technology has changed many other big markets around the world and also tied them more closely together. High-frequency trading is an increasing feature in the currency, bond and commodity markets. Hedge funds and other investors shift both within these markets and between them. Trading strategies can adapt with ease.Such changes have created winners and losers. Traditional brokerages have been forced to upgrade their technology and mourn the loss of bigger trading margins from buying and selling shares. Both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have ceded market share and influence to Bats Exchange and DirectEdge, the new upstart exchanges that have captured about 20 per cent of trading volumes.Against this backdrop, the SEC in January launched a broad review of the structure of US equity markets. The aim was to assess whether the ability of some types of traders with short-term horizons to deploy sophisticated technology might put longer-term investors at a disadvantage; whether the dispersal of liquidity across multiple trading venues meant there was any longer a “unified national market system”; and whether more rules and regulations were needed.The debate is not unique to equity markets, nor to the US. In Europe, concern over how market structures function is just as intense – and opinions just as polarised. Fragmentation between multiple trading venues – a feature of the US landscape for a decade – did not arrive in Europe until 2007, when rules enacted by the European Commission broke the monopolies of established exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive unleashed a wave of competition from new trading platforms. That has led to a confusing picture for investors, made worse by the lack of a US-style national price quoting system – known as a “consolidated tape”.Brussels is about to launch its first review of Mifid, with preparatory work being done by the Committee of European Securities Regulators – just as the US is in the midst of its review. This week, the Paris-based CESR will start studying dozens of comments sent in by market participants.But the scope of CESR’s work – and therefore the eventual Mifid review – has expanded far beyond a routine taking of the temperature, as Europe has had to cope with the consequences of the same technology revolution that swept the US. CESR now says it needs to assess issues such as high-frequency trading “in greater depth due to their potential effects on overall equity market structure”.It is doing so amid concern that a flash crash – and perhaps one without so rapid a rebound as was seen on Wall Street last month – may come to be not solely an American phenomenon. Christian Katz, chief executive of the Swiss stock exchange, says bluntly: “This flash crash could be possible in Europe.” What is more, he points to gaps in co-ordination that might exacerbate that sort of seizure were it to happen. “We cannot guarantee that when we halt trading [in extreme conditions on the Swiss exchange], the same happens on other venues. We should adopt some minimum level of safety systems.”As the debate intensifies, there is growing anxiety that the interests of the big banks and the exchanges are not the same as the interests of investors – a theme that runs through regulators’ efforts to reform derivatives and other markets too.After the flash crash, exchange heads met SEC officials and efforts are afoot to restore trust. Circuit breakers, aimed at stopping dealings if the algorithms that drive high-frequency trading spiral out of control, are due to kick in next week.But Edward Kaufman, a Democratic senator who has repeatedly warned about the dangers of high-frequency trading, says the industry has so far co-operated only “in finding Band-Aid solutions”. He argues: “We may need further action, probably against the interests of those who benefit from the current market design,” adding that “regulators are dependent almost exclusively for the information and evidence they receive about market problems on the very market participants they are supposed to be confronting about needed changes.”A survey by Tabb Group, a consultancy, taken ahead of Wednesday’s SEC meeting, highlights the divergence of views. It found that 62 per cent of survey respondents on the “buy side” – those with money to invest – were negative towards high-frequency trading after the flash crash. Banks on the “sell side” and exchanges remained positive in their views, the survey discovered.Adam Sussman, Tabb’s director of research, finds that worrying. “This is particularly demoralising, given that the buy side are guardians over much of the equity investments in the US,” Mr Sussman says.Whatever the outcome of the debate, the experiences of May 6 confirm that machines are too fast for humans to keep up with – meaning that safety catches need to be automated too. As Mr Angel from Georgetown wrote to the SEC: “In the minute or so it takes for humans to respond to machine meltdown, billions of dollars of damages could occur.”"

240;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-05-18T15:39:33Z;Successful mergers rely on taming the systems;;"As any business school student knows, the classic motives for a merger or acquisition are economies of scale or scope, synergies and market share.But information technology is simultaneously the biggest enabler of those aims and the biggest constraint for most large businesses. As Vimi Grewel-Carr of Deloitte, the consultancy, points out: “Successfully merging the technology systems of two organisations is an imperative for the delivery of the benefits.”Too few companies, however, take this into account when carrying out due diligence: it means the merger process can limp on for longer than is commercially acceptable while incompatible systems are persuaded to talk to each other – with the risk that they might even collapse entirely.Accenture, the consultancy, reports that almost half the top executives involved in M&A point to a weakness in combining IT operations as the main reason for integration failure.Andrew Morlet, head of IT strategy and M&A at Accenture, argues that bringing IT into the planning process at an early stage is critical.Neil Louw, European chief technology officer for the IT services group Dimension Data, points out that as IT is now the production engine for most organisations, a thorough understanding is required – how it works, what its limitations are and where the differences lie between the two organisations. Without this “the acquisition could easily fall flat on its face”.But he says that in the majority of cases, the IT team is only brought in at the planning or even post-acquisition stage: “Having chief information officers and their teams involved from the due diligence stage of any acquisition is more important than having a tight timetable during the merger process.“Involvement from the IT department at this stage enables a focus on the right technical questions that other members of the M&A team ignore.”Giles Nelson, chief technology strategist for the computer services group Progress Software, says companies are increasingly hampered by a lack of an M&A process, over-integration, loss of IT staff and a failure to realise assets and economies of scale.“Working to specific timetables and quick decisions are of paramount importance. IT people are good at vacillating,” he says.“Leadership and objectives are vital to ensure that things move forward apace. Quickly identify the top three areas of integration – for example,
giving customer service access to all customer information systems – and get something done quickly.”Success depends on a clear vision and a determined management. One battle-scarred veteran of the very public merger of two UK companies recalls the difficulties: “We would arrange a meeting between the two IT teams. We would go through the plans for integration, making sure everybody understood and agreed what they were being asked to do. Then they would go off and carry on just as before.”Hugely frustrated, he left to pursue other objectives – and still prefers to remain anonymous.Mark Nutt, general manager for computing services company Morse, warns that too many companies have too little knowledge of what IT assets they possess and how they work together: a first step, therefore, is a full IT audit before settling on a platform.He recommends an agile and scalable architecture, with software development taking place in short phases with continuous feedback and modification.“The problem is that this is still relatively rare,” he says. “Often, organisations have a diverse range of legacy platforms that have been in place
for a number of years, resulting in an overly complex environment. In the event of a great upheaval such as a merger, the complexity and potential for increased downtime present a
significant challenge.”Lack of knowledge of the software assets – that is, the software licences – each party holds can also spell trouble.Martin Mutch, chief executive of the Rocela consultancy, which specialises in Oracle software, says most companies fail to understand or even consider the implications of M&A on their licensing of enterprise software. Yet it constitutes a large part of the IT budget, he says.A number of technology options are available to companies seeking to integrate incompatible systems.There are, for example, commercially available architectures such as Avaya’s “Aura”.Michael Bayer, president of field operation for the company in the EMEA region, describes it as “an open-systems based architecture designed to integrate applications and devices across multi-vendor, multi-location and multi-modal businesses”.“By taking an open-standards approach,” he says, “existing systems can be left in place and will interoperate easily with the new partner systems, meaning that systems do not clash and there is no need for a complete IT overhaul.”David Davies of Corizon, which describes itself as the “enterprise mashup company”, not surprisingly advocates this technology, which unites two or more external sets of data or functionality to create a new, web-based service.It “allows companies quickly and simply to combine different systems into a single, virtual desktop that makes it easy for employees to carry out their tasks”, he says.Cloud computing – internet-based, on-demand computing – offers yet another approach.Ewen Anderson, managing director of Centralis, the computing services group, says: “If neither organisation has a clear best of breed advantage (in IT), moving to a shared service or externally hosted cloud solution may well be a better option than trying to co-habit or merge.”Mike Altendorf, European director for EMC Consulting, agrees, saying a private cloud can be the perfect bridge: “It facilitates the secure movement of information both between and within organisations.“It centralises and consolidates the infrastructure from both companies in a time-frame the merger requires. We have even seen the cloud acting as a holding function to enable companies to migrate their systems.”But even if one party’s systems are clearly superior, there can be dangers. Philip Keown, partner at Grant Thornton, the chartered accountant, warns that each head of IT will champion their own systems, “just as every parent will say their baby is beautiful”.“In any merger situation, the integration into a single culture is key and this is as important for IT people as it is for the rest of the firm.“Businesses need to look at the resources, technical and managerial skills needed in the merged organisation and then decide which people best fit the roles.”Yet another approach is advocated by Colin Rowland of OpTier, the computing services group.He argues that management should see IT from a business transaction perspective, which, he says, enables managers to see the impact of every action the business takes and gain early warning of problems.“Rather than stumbling around in the dark, you are creating operational intelligence to get the job done right and ensure IT is underpinning the success of the M&A, not undermining it.”But returning to the initial question: how important is IT in the merger process?Mr Keown of Grant Thornton says it depends on how important IT is to the business as a whole. For some companies, IT is the business; for others, getting it wrong might be an irritant rather than a calamity.He adds: “If a business reached a position, say three years down the line, in which two supposedly merged companies are both still using their legacy systems, then you have to question why they merged in the first place.”"
241;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Vital lessons of the ‘flash crash’;;Over the past year, in the course of reporting about how the business of trading shares has become a bastion of high technology, I have at times pondered a worrying comparison.Just as many bankers expressed confidence about their risk controls before the financial crisis erupted in 2008, so equity rocket scientists were quick to assure me that the new way of trading equities was safe and that critics were simply “luddites”.I’m quick to appreciate the benefits of lower commissions thanks to greater competition and certainly the market seems fairer than the days when the show was run from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, accounting back then for four-fifths of daily volume.Except that when a stock drops from $40 to trade at one cent, which was what happened to consulting company Accenture among others, during 20 minutes of remarkable Wall Street turmoil on May 6, maybe the luddites have a point about the risk of computers running wild. Just over a week later the cause of the “flash crash”, where in the space of those 20 minutes stocks plunged and rebounded, still remains a mystery. Talk, however, circulates that an algorithm, or “algo” computer program that dominates trading these days, may have exploited an already nervous market by sinking the shares and then buying them back at much cheaper prices.For their part, rival electronic exchanges, high-tech brokerage firms and the Securities and Exchange Commission quickly advocated uniform circuit breakers for individual stocks. These are designed to slow down trading in periods of high volatility.However, such curbs were implemented amid the flash crash on the floor of the NYSE, which now accounts for less than a quarter of the daily volume in its listed companies.As Accenture and Procter & Gamble – whose price fell 37 per cent at one stage – were subject to the floor’s circuit breakers, sell orders flowed to other electronic platforms.Bypassing the NYSE floor when its curbs kick in is allowed under the current rules and happens frequently as there is an intensely competitive rivalry among exchanges.Ultimately, the electronic exchanges including NYSE’s own Arca system were forced to cancel thousands of erroneous trades while the NYSE floor itself emerged unscathed.Beyond the question as to whether the NYSE floor curbs exacerbated selling, what is clear is that trading curbs across all venues are required when liquidity has become so fragmented.True, the algos kicked in at the height of the sell-off and quickly pushed prices back up but that kind of behaviour hardly conveys the image of an orderly market.The big lesson is that a world of purely automated trading systems cannot price stocks accurately in a vicious downdraft. You need a “time out” in order to combat the danger of huge sell orders piling up and overwhelming the market. Some limit on a market sell order derived from the previous sale price would surely mitigate erroneous trades. It is interesting to note that the floor of the NYSE, in spite of being seen as an historical relic by rivals, still commands nearly all of the volume in its listed stocks at the open and close of the trading day.The floor holds auctions for prices in stocks as liquidity floods to the exchange in order to facilitate orderly trading at these times of often heavy volume.While liquidity then disperses across many other trading platforms, there is clearly a role for some kind of human element in trading equities at crucial times.Any moves by the SEC to toughen trading rules for high-frequency traders, who post prices and execute trades in micro seconds, could well benefit the floor model.Technology has brought many benefits to equity trading but the time has come for the pendulum to shift back a little.With NYSE renovating its floor to suit technology, it seems the corner of Broad and Wall Street has some life left in it yet.
242;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-05-11T19:29:50Z;Britain: Safe haven in shadow of debt mountain;;So much for the markets’ tyranny. Three trading days came and went after the polls closed and, while sterling was jumpy, wicked speculators did not annihilate the currency or plunder the gilts market just because Nick Clegg didn’t plump for a partner straight away. On the contrary. There was greater demand for Tuesday’s £2.25bn auction of 2027 gilts – the first such sale of UK government bonds since the election – than last time, even as Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were still locked in talks. Could it be that political uncertainty is not as unsettling to investors, or the UK not as important to them, as the worriers thought?The first explanation is only half-true. When the debt mountain is as high as that facing the new government, a couple of extra days at base camp don’t make much difference. But longer-term failure to make credible plans to conquer the summit would be punished.As for the second, it depends where you’re sitting. A far larger crisis in the eurozone was only just averted at the weekend. If you’re an investor who has just escaped the still-sizzling frying pan of Greek social unrest, the smouldering fire of UK economic uncertainty looks rather welcoming. That goes for inward investors, too. Continental European owners of British companies say sterling’s position outside a crumbling single currency zone is still one of the UK’s big attractions.In other words, while it may seem strange to weary Westminster-centric observers, to many outside the country Britain looks, for now, like a haven.Stelios spews fireWhat is it with unpronounceable names, eruptions and airlines? Moments after unveiling a £50m-£75m hole in its bottom line courtesy of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, EasyJet was dealt a blow by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. Despite having more than a passing interest in the performance of the discount airline’s shares, Sir Stelios decided to blast its performance under outgoing chief executive Andy Harrison.Like the volcano, Sir Stelios’s outbursts are unpredictable and the fallout indiscriminate. His long-running beef with Mr Harrison is over the latter’s supposed pro-growth strategy – a strategy, however, that was anointed by the board and merely executed by its chief executive.But does the embittered shareholder have a point? Sir Stelios is absolutely correct to say shares have gone sideways under Mr Harrison’s stewardship. From the day he took up the reins in December 2005 to the announcement of his intention to quit four years later, the share price has barely budged (albeit that it hit some higher peaks in between, and slightly outpaced its peer, Ryanair). He did not quite double the size of the fleet, although with an extra 80 planes plying the skies you might be miffed that this year’s profits before tax – assuming projections are met – will only reach roughly the level of 2006.The absence of a dividend is galling, especially with £1.36bn of cash on the balance sheet. Sure, this is a cyclical industry that is prey to all the gods can throw at it, from pestilence to war. And true, given the travails of bigger brethren such as British Airways, EasyJet and Mr Harrison deserve kudos for delivering any profits at all. But as she prepares to slip into the captain’s seat, Carolyn McCall, ex-chief executive of Guardian Media Group, should be under no illusions. Turbulence is the norm, especially when an irascible would-be co-pilot is on board.Everything and nothingIt’s hard to fathom why T-Mobile and Orange have named their mobile telephone joint venture Everything Everywhere™. Harder still to work out why their owners, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, decided to attach a ™ to it. The idea anyone would try to steal this name is as unlikely as the brand itself is absurd.The venture’s aim is to combine Orange and T-Mobile networks in the UK, to mutual benefit. On that basis, the brand passes muster as a slogan or mission statement. But other than on till receipts and customer contracts, it will be seen little in public. Mobile services will still be marketed as Orange or T-Mobile. Yet someone somewhere now has to present himself to clients as vice-president of marketing for Everything Everywhere™.The joint venture has spent relatively little on its new name, relative to more grandiose rebrandings. That’s a mercy. It’s also worth remembering we have learnt to live with, if not to love, names that were initially ridiculed. But for every Diageo, Accenture, or O2 (formerly mmO2), there is a Consignia (Royal Mail) or a Monday (PwC’s consulting arm) that meant nothing and went nowhere.
243;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-05-11T16:26:57Z;Lombard Live: Everything going nowhere;DT and France Tel’s new UK mobile brand name is absurd;It’s five days since the election and Britain’s political parties haven’t even started to consider what possible coalitions should be called. Be thankful, though, that one possibility is ruled out: Everything Everywhere™, the new name for T-Mobile and Orange’s mobile telephone joint venture in the UK.Why the companies, owned respectively by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, decided to attach the ™ is a mystery, because the idea that anybody would try to steal this name is as unlikely as the brand itself is absurd.The JV’s aim is to combine Orange and T-Mobile networks in the UK, for the benefit of both sets of users. On that basis, the new brand just about passes muster as an advertising slogan or as a mission statement. But as a corporate identity? Other than a fleeting appearance on till receipts and customer contracts, it will be seen little in public. Mobile services will still be marketed under the Orange and T-Mobile brands. But someone at head office now has to introduce himself to clients as vice president of marketing for Everything Everywhere™.By its own account, the joint venture has spent little on this new brand, at least by the standards of more grandiose rebrandings. That’s a mercy. And it’s worth remembering that we have learnt to live with, if not to love, names that were ridiculed on their first outing. But for every Diageo, NTT DoCoMo (the Japanese mobile company whose name sounds like the Japanese for “everywhere”), and Accenture, there is a Consignia (Royal Mail) and a Monday (PwC’s consulting arm) that meant nothing and went nowhere.
244;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-05-10T12:57:18Z;Covidien’s Almeida: a direct, decisive leader;;"When José Almeida had surgery on varicose veins in his leg in March, the sight of his surgeon’s equipment put him instantly at ease. The device was created by Covidien, where Almeida works; the procedure was quick, and he was up and running almost immediately.A few years ago, the same operation would have left him out of commission for days, painfully stripping the corrupted veins from his leg rather than efficiently stopping the flow of blood.As head of Covidien’s medical device division, Almeida, 47, knew exactly what he was getting into.A veteran of the industry, he has deep knowledge of subjects ranging from medicine to management, melding financial acumen with the mind of an engineer.“We’re here to produce products that save lives,” he says. “These are the things that make people get out of the hospital faster and be healthier.”Almeida grew up in Brazil and trained as an industrial engineer. But he was unexcited by the prospect of working in the car industry, where many of his classmates were heading. Instead, he jumped at the opportunity to join a global company, bringing his rational discipline to the world of consulting at what was then Andersen Consulting, and getting broad corporate experience through the firm’s training programme.From São Paulo, Almeida was transferred to Boston in the early 1990s. “I didn’t want to come,” he says of his move to the US. “But for a Latin American, coming to America to work for a consulting company was a great deal.”Nevertheless, consulting was not in his blood, and he yearned to see the fruits of his labour rather than merely moving on to the next project.He was poached by a client and went to work for Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical company that Covidien now rivals.After bouncing around the medical device industry, Almeida worked his way up through Tyco Healthcare. He also did a short stint at Greatbatch Technologies, which makes components for implantable devices. When Tyco spun off Covidien three years ago, Almeida was picked to head the device unit.Like most companies, the past few years have been a testing time for Covidien and its leaders. Research-endowment returns have been savaged by the downturn, and hospitals have slowed their purchase of expensive equipment such as X-ray machines.As part of its strategy to survive, the company let go of some executives and cut 70 employees, or 15 per cent of the workforce, at its plant in Norfolk, Nebraska.“These are tough decisions,” Almeida says. “The recession has made things more complicated in general. At the end of the day, these decisions fall upon my shoulders, the CEO’s shoulders and the CFO’s shoulders.”For Almeida, the recent challenges have been another part of his journey to become a more effective leader and a better manager. Since his first years in the US, he has faced cultural hurdles as well as the task of taking his technical know-how and translating it into business success.“It’s very difficult for people who don’t live here to understand,” he says of the differences between working in the US and working in Brazil. “By now, I’m quite adept at doing business in the US.”In Latin America, people are more accommodating and understated, he says, and personal relationships can have more influence in business decisions. He recalls a lesson that one of his early mentors at Andersen imparted upon him: “Don’t beat around the bush. You have to tell people the way it is.”Taking that to heart, Almeida made an effort to become more direct and make swift decisions. In fact, he took the lesson so far that once, when his relatives came to visit, they were taken aback by his new-found decisiveness, making him think it might be time to “recalibrate” and be less “harsh”.“People are more open here,” he says. “It doesn’t matter where you come from, but what you are contributing to the team and what you are bringing to the table. It doesn’t matter about your background.”One experience that Almeida says helped him grow immensely was an intensive four-week course that he attended last year as part of Columbia University’s senior executive programme, a corporate boot camp for emerging leaders. The programme combines time at campuses in Norwalk, Connecticut, and in New York, and focuses on stimulating an executive’s leadership potential.“If I know who I am, I manage people better,” Almeida says, pulling out laminated, wallet-sized cards listing his core values of honesty and relationship integrity. “When I’m faced with an integrity issue and I have to take disciplinary action on somebody, I know why I think the way I think. It’s very personal.”The Columbia programme blends some basic management coursework with case studies, group teambuilding activities, personality profiles, personal fitness sessions and lectures on the latest academic research.Almeida says the course has benefited his hiring philosophy, helping him spot natural leaders, and made him a more effective dealmaker.“Most people destroy value when they negotiate,” he says. “They try to squeeze every dime. But you have to know where to squeeze.”Back at Covidien’s US headquarters in Mansfield, Massachusetts, a leafy enclave halfway between Boston and Providence, Almeida’s office is decorated with the fruits of his company’s labour. Covidien’s latest devices, which to the layman look like the contents of a toolbox from the future, are perched like trophies around the room.Even with signs of economic recovery, device makers such as Covidien face big challenges as the US healthcare system undergoes a historic overhaul. The passage of the healthcare reform bill has threatened the industry with new taxes, and heaped scorn upon it for allowing medical costs to swell.Almeida treads carefully around the topic. “Devices are not the biggest contributor to costs by far,” he says, pointing to the rapid growth in the expense of medical services, and the fact that technologies such as the one used on his leg reduce recovery times and expenses.Still, he says Covidien will go along with the new rules and “make it work”. It supports greater access to healthcare, but is still figuring out how the new law will affect the company, he adds.“As a company and as an industry, to be able to introduce these innovations is what we are about,” Almeida says, handling a suction tube device that reduces the chance of throat infections during anaesthesia. “They are not gimmicks.”"
245;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-05-09T23:12:44Z;ETFs suffer severely in record market drop;;Exchange traded funds (ETFs), stock-like securities which have seen explosive growth in recent years, suffered disproportionately from Thursday’s record intra-day US stock market drop.Of the more than 300 securities where Nasdaq and NYSE said they would cancel outlier trades, about two-thirds were ETFs.There are 839 US ETFs out of 5,171 total listed shares on US markets.ETFs, which are listed on exchanges, are used by institutional investors as hedging tools but also as investments by individuals. Their prices are directly related to the value of the securities owned by the fund.Marketmakers in ETFs, like plain vanilla stocks, must make bid and offer prices at all times.Vanguard, a large ETF sponsor, said some marketmakers program very low or high “contingency quotes” into their systems as placeholders. These sell orders were executed in the day’s confusion.“ETFs are often seen as better, more liquid price discovery mechanisms and, because of that, drew volume as stocks shut down …it overwhelmed the trading systems,” said Christian Magoon of Magoon Capital, an independent ETF consultancy.Trading by automated arbitrageurs who exploit tiny differences between the price of funds and their underlying securities added to the swings, he said.“That’s why we saw very uncharacteristic pricing and trading activity.”Another factor was that individual stocks that were among the worst affected by the sell-off, Procter & Gamble and Accenture, for example, are prevalent in some of the large US stocks ETFs. Their moves caused the bid and offer spreads on the ETFs to widen, some said.Noel Archard, iShares managing director at BlackRock, said: “The ETF structure worked as expected, but there seems to be securities market structure issues to be addressed.”The list of candidates for cancelled trades include some of the biggest and most heavily traded ETFs.One example, the $2.2bn Rydex SGI equal-weight S&P index fund, saw its price go from $24.50 to $0.15 in one trade, according to data provider IndexUniverse.ETFs held about $1,032bn globally in assets at the end of 2009, according to Blackrock, versus just $566bn in 2006.
246;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Trade Runner;Traders’ reliance on machines won’t go away, despite accidents;In the Hollywood version, a highly sophisticated computer – let’s call it “Tradebot” – would become sentient and malicious, wrecking the global financial system. Fortunately, such scenarios remain in the realm of science fiction, but Tradebot Systems is a real company that often does one in 20 transactions on US stock exchanges. Computers that handle more than half of all volume are taking the heat for Thursday’s epic plunge. But the original error was human, as were the algorithms that exacerbated the chain reaction. Refinement of the circuit breakers enacted after the 1987 crash are needed. Curbing computer trading could be counterproductive, though. True, they cannot comprehend how unrealistic it is for Accenture to be worth a mere $6m. But humans alone could never provide the sort of liquidity we now take for granted.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
247;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;US shares plunge amid fears over debt;;US equity prices whipsawed in value before closing sharply lower on Thursday during a wild day on Wall Street that prompted leading stock exchanges to cancel some trades amid fears of trader errors and computer malfunctions.Global equity prices were battered all day by worries that Greece would default on its debt, but the bottom fell out of the US market during the New York afternoon, wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in value.The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said they would “review the unusual trading activity that took place briefly this afternoon” and pledged to work with exchanges to protect investors.The turmoil also affected deliberations on a financial reform bill in the US Senate, where Democrat Ted Kaufman called for a response to “the potential for giant high-speed computers to generate false trades and create market chaos”.The S&P 500 ended off 3.2 per cent, at 1,128.15, after a roller-coaster ride that recalled the dark days of the financial crisis. At 2.38pm in New York, the index was down 4 per cent. Six minutes later, it was down 8.6 per cent at 1,065.79. By 2.54pm it was back at 1,120.The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst intra-day points fall – 998.5, or 9.2 per cent – before ending down 3.2 per cent.Trading in individual stocks was even more bizarre. Procter & Gamble, the consumer products group, fell 37 per cent before ending 2.3 per cent lower. Some stocks – including Accenture, the consultancy – traded briefly at one cent or less.Nasdaq said it would cancel trades between 2.40pm and 3pm in which prices moved more than 60 per cent. It said: “This decision cannot be appealed.”A spokesman at NYSE Euronext said it would cancel some trades on its NYSE Arca electronic platform that took place between 2.40pm and 3.00pm.As talk circulated of a trading error at a large bank, Citigroup issued a statement that it had “no evidence that Citi was involved in any erroneous transaction”.P&G said: “We aren’t in a position to comment on the details of an individual trade today but we believe the trade was an error.”The stock sell-off sparked tumult in markets for currencies, commodities and Treasury bonds, which are often traded by computer programmes that react to equity moves.Gold surged above $1,200 an ounce, and oil dropped more than $5 a barrel.
248;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Trading goes wild on Wall Street;;At mid-afternoon in New York on Thursday traders believed the day’s lows had already been seen, but what followed next revived memories of the dark days of the financial crisis of 2008.At 2:38pm, trading simply went wild.The S&P 500 had already fallen 4 per cent to the key level of 1,120, when the market, which is now dominated by rapid-fire computer systems, known as algorithmic or “algos”, suddenly sliced though that threshold and started plunging.Within five minutes the benchmark was down 8.6 per cent at 1,065.79, the S&P’s worst intra-day decline since December 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. Equity volatility soared as much as 60 per cent when the S&P bottomed, a surge not seen since February 2007 when jitters over subprime mortgages roiled markets.Amid a deluge of selling, a number of stocks, including Accenture, the consulting company, traded briefly at the price of 1 cent or less. The price of Procter & Gamble, a blue-chip consumer product group, seen as a safe stock, fell 37 per cent in a matter of minutes.The speed of the descent in stock prices and moves in other markets such as currencies and Treasury bonds, which are highly automated, fuelled suspicion that a computer trading program error had occurred as traders wrestled with the anxiety that Greece could become the first eurozone country to default on its debt.“It feels like someone made a large mistake in selling stock that exacerbated the trade in bonds,” said Tom di Galoma, head of trading at Guggenheim Partners. “In my 25 years in the business I have never seen bonds have that type of move in a 20-minute period.”Within minutes of the market’s precipitous plunge and startling rebound, unconfirmed rumours of a “fat finger” trading error were swirling around Wall Street. The most popular one, which spread rapidly in the echo chamber of gossipy trading rooms, was that a Citigroup trader had typed “billions” instead of “millions” on a sell order, causing an immediate drop in the market and prompting further panic selling.As traders debated how the sophisticated technology systems of a large bank could have failed to spot such an error, Citi issued a statement saying it had “no evidence that [it] was involved in any erroneous transaction”. However, the US bank added that, along with the rest of the financial industry, it was investigating the reasons for the market’s collapse.Nasdaq and NYSE Arca, the electronic trading platform, said late on Thursday that they would cancel certain trades made between 2.40pm and 3pm.For months, regulators have been under pressure to implement tougher guidelines as computerised trading has flourished in recent years.The Securities and Exchange Commission is undertaking a broad overview of the equity market structure in the US.“Any action, whether ‘erroneous’ or not, will likely raise the outcry against high-frequency trading and more than likely accelerate the momentum driving financial reform stateside and worldwide,” said John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities.“Today is a wake up call that algos can run wild” said James Angel, professor of finance at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.
249;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-05-06T23:41:23Z;‘Crash of 2.45’ paralyses market participants;;Erin Burnett, the anchor of CNBC’s Street Signs afternoon TV show, ended Thursday’s programme saying it had been “the most exciting 15 minutes in Street Signs’ history”.As the big equity indexes took a sudden, and as yet unexplained, dive at about 2:30pm, market participants were paralysed by the fear that this could be “the big one” – a crash to rival other dark days in stock-market history.They were glued to trading, television and computer screens, which echoed the febrile media mood of the autumn of 2008. Unlike the days following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, TV screens were cutting between the dizzying drop in the Dow and unnerving scenes of rioting in Greece.In one five-minute exchange that bounced around e-mail inboxes and social media sites, Ms Burnett and Jim Cramer, host of the financial network’s Mad Money programme, watched as shares in Procter & Gamble, supposedly one of the Dow’s most staid components, plunged as much as 32 per cent.“That’s not a real price. Just go buy Procter & Gamble,” said Mr Cramer. Before he had finished his explanation, the stock had bounced to only 5 per cent down.The swings in some stocks were unprecedented. In one of the most bizarre movements of the day, shares in Accenture, the UK-based consultancy, went from more than $40 at 2.47pm to 1 cent a minute later, before returning to their previous levels shortly afterwards.As CNBC commentators swung from talk of capitulation to as-yet-unconfirmed speculation that the sudden crash was caused by a “fat-fingered” trade at a large bank, the fear rang through the echo-chamber of the internet. Bloggers swapped rumours, cnbc.com recorded its heaviest traffic ever, and some other financial sites crashed.By the time TV screens were showing the traditional applause for the closing bell, a partial recovery had lightened the mood, with an opportunistic “I survived the crash of 2.45” T-shirt offer widely forwarded on Twitter.The words of one senior bank trader summed up Wall Street’s feelings: “Was it the end of the world? No, but it sure felt like it for a few minutes.”
250;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-05-06T00:37:39Z;Concern at level of US small company hiring;;A senior US Treasury official on Wednesday expressed concern about the unevenness of the recovery in the US labour market, with small businesses hiring few workers even as job creation picks up among large corporations.“Labour demand by small establishments has continued to be weak, with notably low rates of new hires,” Alan Krueger, assistant secretary for economic policy and chief economist for the Treasury department, told Congress.“The challenges small businesses are facing remain a significant concern to policymakers within the administration.”Mr Krueger’s testimony before the joint economic committee, which included previously unpublished data he sought from the labour department, noted that large companies had “apparently increased employment” between September 2009 and February 2010. He called this “a possible early sign of durable job growth”.In one example, John Campagnino, senior director of recruitment at Accenture, the consulting and information technology group, told the FT that his company was on track to hire some 7,000 new workers in the US during the current fiscal year – a return to pre-recession levels of hiring.But stronger hiring by large companies will not be enough to sustain a recovery in the labour market. Businesses with fewer than 250 employees account for three-quarters of private employment in the US, making them an arguably more important part of the American economic puzzle.Mr Krueger said that when the recession hit, small businesses made aggressive job cuts and shut down operations earlier than large companies, which went through a cycle of hiring freezes before moving to layoffs.During the recovery, one of the main factors behind the lacklustre job creation among small businesses has been their lack of access to credit, in contrast to large companies, which have benefited from improvements in the debt markets. This has made it difficult for companies to plan expansions and has stymied the development of start-ups.Republican lawmakers in particular have suggested that uncertainty over the impact of new legislation supported by the Obama administration and congressional Democrats, including healthcare reform, are also making small business owners wary of hiring new workers.Mr Krueger’s testimony came ahead of Friday’s release of the monthly gauge of the health of the US labour market. Economists are expecting the US economy to have added about 190,000 jobs in April, which would be the second consecutive month of job creation. March non-farm payrolls were higher by 162,000 positions.Private sector payrolls, which will exclude a temporary hiring boom led by the government related to the 2010 census, are expected to grow by about 100,000, after increasing by 123,000 in March. However, the unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 9.7 per cent.
251;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-04-19T04:38:33Z;Skilled clients pose threat to ad agencies;;Traditional advertising agencies risk being squeezed out by “digitally empowered” clients dissatisfied with their skills in online, viral and mobile marketing, according to an annual survey of chief marketing officers globally.The CMO Council, whose members control more than $150bn in annual marketing budgets, found that senior marketing executives expect to become less dependent on agencies this year as they focus more on in-house skills such as managing ever-increasing volumes of data about their customers.The State of Marketing survey of more than 500 chief marketing officers, released on Monday, reports that marketers’ attention has shifted from their traditional ad agencies to training staff and bringing in digital skills through new hires and specialist agencies.“You’ve got to look at the difference between the ability to create nifty interactive campaigns and actually having customer data, which underpins everything today. That data resides in the enterprise,” said Donovan Neale-May, executive director of the CMO Council.“Whereas before the agencies had a huge amount of influence, now the companies are going to have the insights about the effectiveness of these campaigns,” he added.A new breed of consultancies, from Infosys to Deloitte, is moving into areas of the marketing industry once dominated by advertising agency groups, offering infrastructure support and services, Mr Neale-May said.Accenture, for example, took over Procter & Gamble’s web technology infrastructure in September.The CMO Council’s first survey since the industry began to see some rebound from a searing advertising recession, found that 72 per cent of marketers predicted there would be no further job losses.“We’re not seeing headcount reduction, but they need to retrain [staff],” Mr Neale-May said.“In many cases, they have to do lobotomies because some of their marketers are still doing things the analogue way,” he added.As a new generation of consumers becomes more attracted to devices from smartphones to tablet computers, “the media formats are becoming richer and more engaging and creating more viral discussions, so marketing becomes more technology-driven and more technology-powered”, Mr Neale-May said.
252;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-04-10T03:20:27Z;Tiger Woods’ return draws in millions;;Tiger Woods has dispelled doubts about his continued commercial appeal by drawing record-breaking television and online audiences for his return to professional golf after months of tabloid scandal.ESPN, the Walt Disney-owned sports channel with the rights to live coverage of the first two rounds of the US Masters, said the golfer’s first round of the Masters Tournament on Thursday had been “the most-viewed golf telecast in cable history”.An estimated 4.9m people tuned in to ESPN to see Mr Woods tee off for the first time since his admission of serial infidelity, 47 per cent above the audience for the opening day of the 2009 Masters and more than the 4.76m people who watched his Monday play-off with Rocco Mediate for the 2008 US Open championship.Mr Woods’ position high up on the leaderboard as he made his way around the course to applause from the packed crowds, bodes well for CBS, which will air the final rounds of the US Masters on Saturday and Sunday.“He’s perfectly positioned for this to be huge. This is about as good a set-up as you could have hoped for,” said Larry Gerbrandt, principal of Media Valuation Partners.“If he stays in contention on the final day, I think we could definitely have a shot at breaking all-time records.”Mr Woods holds the record for the most watched Masters, when 20.3m viewers watched him win the tournament for the first time in 1997, or 14.1 per cent of all US households, according to Nielsen.CBSSports.com, which showed the first day’s play online, reported that more than 556,000 unique users, more than double the visitors it had seen a year earlier, watched 71 per cent more live video.Mr Woods also cemented his commercial rehabilitation this week with a black-and-white advertisement for Nike, his most loyal sponsor.In the ad he stares blank-faced at the camera, dressed in Nike-branded gear, as the voice of his late father intones “did you learn anything?”By Friday afternoon, the commercial had been watched 2m times on YouTube.Mr Woods was the most bankable star in sports.However, he was abruptly dropped by sponsors, including Accenture, after a late night car crash outside his house unleashed a torrent of lurid revelations about his personal life.A fortune in endorsements, broadcast rights and prize money is riding on his continued success.“For Tiger, this is about new sponsors and repairing his marketability, not necessarily getting old sponsors back,” Mr Gerbrandt said.
253;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-04-09T22:52:51Z;Brand Tiger Woods;The wisdom of Nike and Tag Heuer in staying with the golfer;"This weekend, the people at Nike and Tag Heuer are presumably very happy. After all, the photographs seen around the world this week have been of their man, Tiger Woods, at the Masters, wearing his Nike cap and shirt and Tag Heuer wristwatch. Steadfastly standing by their endorsee while other sponsors such as Accenture and AT&T sidled away after news of Woods’ marital misbehaviour broke at the end of last year, Nike et al are once again front and centre in the golf world, as the fallen superstar returns to the course.They are clearly betting that their loyalty will pay off, literally – that Woods’ talent (and need to prove himself) will trump any trace of moral ambiguity, driving weekend players into golf shops to try, once again, to dress like Tiger, in the hope it will help them to birdie like him. They are betting, in other words, on a certain kind of consumer psychology.But I wonder if it’s really that simple, because such a bet depends on two assumptions: (1) that Tiger’s fall from grace has made him less attractive as a front man; and (2) that it will change because if he wins, everyone will forget about his faux pas. All of which is general marketing wisdom. The problem is, I’m not convinced it holds true anymore.Certainly, the idea that we attempt to imitate other people’s success by dressing like them is at the core of many fashion sales strategies. Just consider the truism that if you want to be the boss you should dress like the boss – or the even more straightforward rationale behind the online fashion website asos.com, its name derived from the acronym for As Seen On Screen. It’s why brands sign up “ambassadors” such as Chanel’s socialite stylist Caroline Sieber and Christian Dior’s Charlize Theron, and why every fashion journalist is inundated with press releases the day after an awards show, announcing which celebrity wore which brand. Forests of glossy paper have been sold on the basis of providing information on what famous people are wearing, so those who want to be famous too can dress like their idols.But increasingly, the concept of being “famous” – or even “successful” – is losing its moral dimension and becoming synonymous with “notorious”; all seem to be defined as “with a recognisable name”.Think about it. Last year Levi Johnston (Sarah Palin’s ex-not-quite-son-in-law) starred in an advertisement for pistachios; Paris Hilton shilled for hamburger chain Carl’s Jr. Katie Price moves novels, and multiple Pop Idol contestants have had their spokesperson moments. None of these is necessarily an individual that others want to emulate (at least I hope not), yet their notoriety somehow elevates them into the realm of what sociologists would call “influencers.” Which makes me wonder if it’s their humanity – their fallibility, their naked desire for their 15 minutes of fame – that constitutes their attraction; that, in fact, it’s precisely their non-superiority that makes them effective sales agents.Put another way, as much as we like our superstars and want to emulate them superficially, we also like people to whom we can relate – or even feel superior – internally. This is, after all, the basis of reality TV, which pretty much trumps what I consider the best written and acted shows (24, Glee, House) in the ratings every time. Watching C-list celebrities eat bugs in the jungle has the obsessive appeal of a train wreck. It’s not reverse psychology so much as absolution psychology: selling an experience that makes you glad you are you, as opposed to selling a product that makes you a better you. And its efficacy should not be underestimated – nor the implication that perhaps it was a mistake for the Woods’ team to doubt him during his period as a “tarnished champion”, “scandal-fatigued golfer” and whatever else they called him when the hoo-ha started. The publicity boost he experienced might, in fact, have worked to their own ends (the double entendres associated with various tag lines taking on a life of their own via the web and keeping his name very much in the public eye, while he himself was out of it). And it would be a corresponding mistake to assume a giant uptick in sales afterwards. Because maybe what has been going on over the last few months, in stores if not on the green, is, rather, par for the course. All puns intended.In fact, the revelation of Woods’ human foibles may have been a good thing, not just for the man himself but for his sponsors. Previously, for every sports fan who desired a Gillette razor because an automaton-like golfer used it, perhaps there was another who thought his malcoordination made the chance of nicks just too great. Since last December, of course, when it was revealed that Woods himself is far less than perfect, such a fear would be less of an issue.Sports gods are one thing, after all, but how much more accessible is a sports god whose feet of clay we can mould in our own image?vanessa.friedman@ft.com

254;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-04-07T21:52:55Z;When star power finds the rough;;As Tiger Woods prepares to tee off at The Masters on Thursday, the humbled athlete is not the only one counting the cost of his fall from grace. The 34-year-old golfer’s reputation as a clean-living and dedicated sportsman and husband was undone when his infidelities were spilled across television, newspapers and internet sites in the wake of a mysterious car accident at his home in late November.Mr Woods’ success on the course had enabled him to line up lucrative sponsorship deals off of it, with brands including Accenture, Nike, Gillette, Electronic Arts and Gatorade signing him up to lucrative sponsorship deals. Some estimates suggest that the arrangements made him the world’s first sports star to make $1bn in career earnings.But as his life became embroiled in scandal, those companies also took direct financial hits, from having to commission and produce new advertising to the costs of their own public relations campaigns explaining their actions in dropping the golfer and legal fees. According to a study by Christopher Knittel and Victor Stango, economists at the University of California, Davis, the stock market value of all the companies endorsed by Mr Woods collectively lost $5bn-$12bn by the middle of December.Of course, companies do not need a celebrity relationship to experience reputational damage. Toyota estimates that its global recall of cars this year had a direct cost of about $2bn (€1.5bn, £1.3bn). That figure does not take into account potential lost future sales, or Toyota’s own stock price decline, which has knocked Y1,673bn ($17.8bn, €13.3bn, £11.7bn) off its market value even after a strong rebound in the past month.The size of such losses is helping to fuel a growing debate about whether a corporate reputation is insurable – and about what exactly it is that a company would want to insure.In the wake of the Tiger Woods scandal, DeWitt Stern, the insurance broker, saw an opportunity to publicise a product it had launched to cover reputational risk, including how to deal with celebrity endorsers becoming engulfed in scandal. More recently, Lloyd’s of London, the insurance market, held a conference on how to manage reputational risk and what cover – if any – might be available.Reputation is a slippery issue not only because it can be hard to define exactly what it is until it has taken a knock, but also because people – and companies – can trade just as much off edgy or wild reputations as they can off good, clean ones.When Kate Moss, the supermodel, was caught taking cocaine in 2005, many of the brands she then represented, such as H&M, the retailer, ran a mile – but other, differently positioned names, such as Sir Philip Green’s Top Shop, soon took her on.“Kate Moss is an interesting example,” says Mark Borkowski, who runs an eponymous public relations agency. “The teenage brands fell apart, but Virgin and some other edgier brands moved straight in.”Companies are increasingly recognising that reputation is an important and valuable asset that is vulnerable and volatile, according to Anthony Fitzsimmons, chairman of Reputability, a consultancy focused on reputation and crisis strategy, risk and management.“Reputation can be an organisation’s most valuable intangible asset, though it appears in few balance sheets except as [goodwill in] acquisitions,” he says. “People are generally aware of their brand values, but many have not worked out what matters most when things are going wrong. Few have made a systematic analysis of what might damage their reputation, let alone worked out how to make their reputation intrinsically strong through difficult times.”However, Mr Fitzsimmons says that in discussions with insurers and reinsurers over a number of years he has been unable to find a way of protecting the full financial value of a reputation. “So far, the conclusion has always been that to cover the value of a corporate reputation in any meaningful sense is virtually impossible,” he says.Part of the problem is how to assess what a company is able to cover. There are the direct costs – such as product recalls, PR spending and lost profits – that might be relatively simple to work out. But what of the potential lost future sales from the long-term reputational damage? How should anyone assess how a company would have performed in an alternative future that has been forfeited?If markets are efficient – a theory with fewer adherents than ever after the market turmoil of the past two years – then the value of what a company will do in future should be reflected in its current share price. But even if markets were efficient, there is still the problem of when an insurer or investor measures what has been lost.The University of California, Davis study took the difference between the value of Mr Woods’ corporate partners on the day of the crash and a day in mid-December that was one week after he announced his indefinite break from golf. An arbitrary call.Similarly with Toyota, the shares had lost Y3,173bn at their worst a little more than one month after the first recall was announced in January, but have since recovered almost half that loss. In a year’s time, they might be worth more than before the recalls. But determining which part of the stock’s move in price is to do with reputation and which part is to do with the broader economy or market is a further complicating factor.None of this has stopped insurers beginning to offer some sort of cover for reputational risk. Companies such as AIG – now called Chartis – have for a few years been augmenting traditional Directors & Officers policies with extras such as “spin-doctor cover” to pay for the publicists and brand consultants needed if a company’s reputation takes a hit.Dan Trueman at Kiln, a Lloyd’s of London insurer that is involved in the DeWitt Stern product, says that because companies have become increasingly concerned about insuring intangible assets such as reputation, insurers have focused on what they can insure. “The risks that keep company directors awake at night are no longer about the tangible assets, such as a building burning down,” he says. “It is much more about the intangible – reputations, moving data around, intellectual property and counterfeiters.”The most important costs from all these risks are in the short-term loss of revenues that often result, along with legal and communications costs – and not the muddier concepts of goodwill or share price.“The maximum indemnity period tends to be a year, but most important is the first few days, including the PR and crisis management,” he says. “The longer term does not matter nearly so much as continuing to generate revenues in the near term. Most clients only want six months’ cover.”Mr Trueman’s clients have included not only makers of things, such as pharmaceutical and technology companies, but also law firms and a private school in Australia worried about unsuitable people slipping through safety and criminal checks to work with children.But the heightened awareness of reputational risks and the short-term nature of the insurance are, in fact, symptoms of the same condition: the multi-faceted, ever-present modern media. This means that reputational crises can erupt and spread quickly, but if combatted well can burn out just as fast.“In the digital world, everyone can comment on your product or brand immediately and you have to be aware of what people are saying about your brand,” says Mr Borkowski. “There will be a time when Twitter gets a billion followers [and] that’s a huge conversation. As a company you have to have the resources to monitor and respond to that – and quickly.”
255;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-04-07T07:49:53Z;Dragon Oil cancels move to Bermuda;;Dragon Oil has dropped a plan to move its nominal corporate home from Ireland to Bermuda.The oil development and production group, which is 52 per cent owned by Dubai’s state-owned Emirates National Oil Company, said the decision followed an extensive review and consultation with shareholders.Abdul Jaleel al Khalifa, chief executive, said the review had determined that “Ireland remains an attractive jurisdiction for the holding company of the group”.The restructuring was originally proposed in March 2009, when incorporating the company in Bermuda rather than Ireland would have proved more tax efficient. The company also planned to downgrade its stock market presence in Dublin to a secondary listing, saying that its Irish presence was something of a historical quirk.However, plans were put on hold last year when ENOC revealed its interest in buying the remaining 48 per cent stake in the company. This interest materialised into a bid that was eventually rejected by Dragon’s other shareholders last December.The decision not to redomicile in Bermuda comes as large numbers of companies are moving away from the Caribbean island over concerns about offshore legislation proposed by the Obama administration, which would target companies operating in the US but incorporated offshore and bring them under US tax jurisdiction.Last year Accenture, the global management consultancy, moved its incorporated status from Hamilton, Bermuda to Dublin. Willis, the risk management group, followed suit in September to “help ensure our continued global competitiveness”, according to Joe Plumeri, chief executive and chairman.Dragon has its headquarters in Dubai and its activities are focused on Turkmenistan. Its shares are traded on both the London Stock Exchange and the Irish Stock Exchange.Last month, the company told the Financial Times that it would be using its cash pile of more than $1bn (£660m) to make further acquisitions, in spite of a drop in profits because of falling energy prices.Dragon said on Wednesday that its London listing had now been designated as a “premium listing” under new listing rules.
256;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Whitehall bill for consultants hits £1.7bn;;The taxpayer has spent more than £1.7bn on consultants’ fees for Whitehall departments in the past six years.Analysis of payments by the government to the 12 biggest consultancy firms reveals a total bill of £1.6bn for the five years to 2008-09, with a further £178m for 2009-10 so far.Data compiled by the Liberal Democrats from parliamentary answers show that Whitehall’s annual spending on consultants has increased more than fivefold in five years, from £74m in 2004-05 to £388m in 2008-09.The top-spending Whitehall areas are the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health, which between them have paid the 12 consultancy companies more than £1bn since April 2004. The firms reaping the highest cumulative payments from the government are Accenture, Deloitte and PwC, which have collectively charged the taxpayer £1.4bn since April 2004.Lord Oakeshott, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the figures revealed the government as “consultaholics” whose plans to cut future bills represented a “triumph of hope over experience”.The scale of the expenditure helps explain why all three main parties have made consultants a target of their planned efficiency savings. Last month’s Budget pledged to halve departments’ consultancy bills and cut Whitehall’s marketing and communications spend by 25 per cent from 2008-09 levels. The Treasury forecast that the cuts would save more than £650m by 2012-13.The Conservative party intends to cut consultancy expenditure as part of £12bn of efficiency savings planned for 2010-11. The Liberal Democrats have set out plans for “slashing a bloated central bureaucracy, kicking the consulting habit and ending illiberal and costly government databases”.But some consultancy work may prove difficult to axe without incurring additional costs. Accenture told the FT on Monday that, unlike other firms on the list, most of its payments covered the design, building and running of large-scale IT systems.The Tories on Monday called for a moratorium on Whitehall spending on advertising until after the election, highlighting figures that showed the government had spent £35m in February, the highest for that month since records began.Francis Maude, shadow Cabinet Office minister, accused Labour of “trying to buy the election using millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money with a last-minute, state-sponsored advertising blitz”.Mr Maude has written to Gus O’Donnell, the cabinet secretary, asking him to halt government advertisements immediately.
257;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-04-02T18:06:41Z;Man in the News: Tiger Woods;The golfer returns with a twin mission, writes Jurek Martin: rehabilitate himself with the public, and revive the sport;"Tiger Woods appeared in this space two summers ago after winning the US Open, the last of his 14 major golf championships, with a double stress fracture in his left leg. It was noted then that for all his status as the most visible sportsman on earth he remained a closed book, his private life, beyond the bare bones, a complete mystery.It will be a fallen idol who steps on to the first tee among the blooming azaleas and dogwoods at Augusta National for the Masters Championship on Thursday. Salivating television executives are already describing his return to competition after a self-imposed four-month hiatus as the biggest event since the inauguration of President Barack Obama.Parts of the closed book have become a tawdry public read, ever since last Thanksgiving night outside his Florida home – a smashed SUV, a semi-conscious superstar, a club-wielding wife – set in train revelations exposing him as a sex addict, with numerous affairs with bar girls and nightclub hostesses only too willing to reveal his prowess in bed and their bodily charms all over the internet and tabloids.He fell from commercial grace, too. Some sponsors, above all Nike, remained faithful, but others dropped him like a stone. The face that blazoned a thousand airports for Accenture, the consulting firm, became a non-person. Professional golf as a whole is in a funk without him, its television ratings down 30-40 per cent and no young gun or veteran player filling his shoes. Not all its woes can be attributed to Woods – the carmakers and banks that underwrote a third of tournaments two years ago have pulled back, depleted by the credit crunch. Even the amateur game is suffering, three times as many courses closing last year as opening.So he returns to the stage next week with a twin mission – to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of a once uncritical public and to revive the sport that made him famous. For both, he must win, and win soon, but it is hard to say which the more formidable challenge is.Woods the man still has not revealed much of himself. There was one halting public statement in front of cameras but with the pesky media excluded, and two brief, controlled interviews with sporting television channels in which he declared his private life still off-limits (and also his in-patient therapy at the Mississippi clinic specialising in sexual addiction). In the first, he appeared shattered, a deer caught in headlights, as he recited the predictable litany of apologies, to his wife, family, fans and sponsors. He mentioned as factors his exaggerated sense of entitlement and departure from the Buddhist teachings instilled by his Thai-born mother. In the second, he intoned, almost mechanically: “I’d been living a lie.”Most psychologists would include the death of his father four years ago as a tipping point. Earl Woods was a hard-driving military man, mentor, tutor and controlling influence over his son, once likening his progeny to Gandhi. But Earl was no saint; his second marriage, to Tida, Tiger’s mother, ended in estrangement, and the scuttlebutt on the circuit was of a man who often took what he wanted without asking.Close observers detected the change on the course last year. There was a foul-tempered club-throwing incident in Australia in November. Michael Jordan, the retired basketball superstar and an adviser to the US team at October’s Presidents Cup, thought, presciently, that Woods was “putting himself under more pressure” than he had previously detected.If he remains on an emotional hair-trigger, Augusta is the safest place to resurface, and not simply because he is a four-time Masters champion. It may be a high-pressure event but the environment is the most tightly controlled in golf, run not by the professional tour but by the club itself, self-appointed dean of its cathedral. It brooks no heretics, banning reporters considered insufficiently respectful. Any heckler who yells out the name of Jamie Jungers or any other Woods dalliance will be thrown off the grounds by Pinkerton-clad heavies, not just for the day but for life. Subsequent tournaments, however, will be more fraught with danger.Nor will he lack support from his fellow professionals because, whatever their private feelings, they need him, badly. Because of him, prize money on the tour has grown four-fold since he joined it in 1996. In that year, only nine golfers won $1m; last year 91 did, a powerful testament to his trickle-down effect on the journeyman player. The tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, is beating about the bushes, with some success, to bring in new sponsors to replace the departed banks and car companies, even if the Waste Management Open does not trip off the tongue as easily as the Buick. But, minus Woods, a lucrative new television contract may be hard to negotiateThe players also know that nobody, and particularly no American, has filled the void. The tour has frantically tried to publicise newcomers – Anthony Kim, Camillo Villegas, Rory McIlroy – but they are not consistently there yet. The fan-friendly Phil Mickelson remains what he has long been, great on his day but not every day, while the other erstwhile leading rival, Vijay Singh, has been hampered by knee (and putting) problems. Amiable Ernie Els of South Africa has his game back after a long absence, but he is another foreigner on a circuit increasingly dominated by non-Americans (two Englishmen, Ian Poulter and Paul Casey, contested the Match Play final in February). For all, or, indeed, because of, his mixed-race bloodlines, Woods is definitively American – and the US tour remains his main stage.The storybook start to the next chapter would have him winning the Masters, smiling and fist-pumping his way round the course and embracing his reconciled wife, Elin, and two children on the 18th green. Messy reality may find his game not sharp after months away, the grin may be forced and the family may not be there when it is over, win or lose. He has conceded his marriage is now a new work in progress, thanks to his transgressions, and the daughter of a former Swedish government minister may not be the average, supportive golfer’s (or politician’s) wife. But, for a week at least, golf, not war, peace and healthcare, will top everybody’s agenda."
258;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-03-18T17:05:14Z;Sports sponsorship: Why you would stick with Tiger amid media storm;;There is one brand sticking with sport, or – more to the point – a sportsman.TAG Heuer, amid a media storm in December when the golfer’s private life exploded into the headlines – said it was sticking with Tiger Woods and is continuing to use him as a brand ambassador in specific territories.The move has sparked controversy and, in the US at least, the brand has scaled down his engagements. But as Woods starts to rebuild his personal profile, many think the decision could play in the company’s favour.“We’ve taken a culturally sensitive approach,” says Jean-Christophe Babin, chief executive at TAG Heuer. “We adjusted the intensity of the exposure according to the market. In the US it shocked a lot of people, so we played it low-key there. Tiger prefers also not to be public in the US which we needed to respect. However, in China, he’s bigger than ever. We still use him there a lot.”He adds: “We don’t feel there’s been any long-term impact to our brand. Maybe in the short term we might have lost some US sales. We’ve received some letters of complaint about our partnership. But would those people have bought the brand anyway? I don’t know. That’s marginal. Tiger Woods is just one expression of TAG Heuer.“I think it’s different when companies rely on a single ambassador and all their eggs are in one basket, such as Accenture. They might have a problem. But we have several ambassadors and have been able to adapt strategically.”Amanda Bross, partner and head of endorsement at Finch & Partners, says: “When a scandal, occurs many companies have knee-jerk reactions. Is TAG Heuer waiting to see what happens? Only they know that.“In my opinion, what he [Tiger Woods] did was a private act, which was blown up by obsessive media coverage. If it had been criminal activity, then they would be justified in walking away, but it’s different when it’s a moral question. Audiences in Europe and America react differently to adultery.”There is no denying Woods’ enduring commercial reach. At his peak, he drew golfing audiences of 50m along with a slew of advertising and sponsorship deals to high-profile tournaments.Prior to the controversy, when he was featured in a television advertisement, sponsors saw a 16 per cent higher recall of the commercial itself, along with a 22 per cent higher brand recall. A study conducted by Nielsen, a consumer research company, showed that when Woods returned from injury last February, ratings in the tournaments in which he did not play were down 47 per cent compared with the previous year.Ticket and sponsorship sales have fallen by between 15 and 20 per cent at Torrey Pines from the last time Woods played in 2008.Despite the scandal, he draws huge media interest. His recent televised apology generated viewers of 521,000 for the Golf Channel. Fox News Channel got more than 2m viewers for the televised statement, ESPN received 1.7m and there is speculation of a comeback among sports bloggers.“The audiences for golf tournaments have been drastically reduced since he’s withdrawn from competing. That’s a persuasive argument for a measured response. He still has huge influence,” says Ms Bross.“Woods has been an important personality on the golf scene since he was young, and it is unlikely that will change. TAG Heuer is also a brand that works with ambassadors on a long-term basis. They’re not just the face of the moment. They have a real relationship.“We’ve seen what happens when companies run away and come back. It can be damaging.”According to Ilaria Alber-Glanstaetten, luxury analyst at Provenance, the scandal could even benefit him. “In markets where family values are big, it makes sense to scale back. TAG Heuer is in the unique position of flexibility. If it blows over, it’s in a really strong position,” she says.“His reputation has been seriously damaged in certain circles, particularly in the US where family values are important. His reputation there was built on perfection and that’s something that Americans find very appealing.“In Europe we’re less into that. With the scandal, his character has actually gained depth. He seems like a much more interesting character now. In the future, that could make an interesting avenue to explore.”Mr Babin at TAG Heuer says: “I’m pretty convinced that when he returns to golfing that [the response in the US] will change. Nothing can undermine the talent and determination. He will dominate the world of golf for years to come because he’s considered the best golfer in the world.“I can only see that his presence will grow. At the end of the day, the way he plays commands respect. The way he plays his private life is another case, but it’s personal for everyone. I think most people will be compassionate.”
259;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-03-16T18:13:49Z;Woods’ return to golf heralds TV bonanza;;Tiger Woods, the world’s top golfer, will emerge next month from his self-imposed exile to play the Masters tournament in Augusta, Georgia.His return to the professional game, after reports of marital infidelity put his career on pause, looks likely to send television viewer numbers, if not advertising revenue, for CBS, the tournament’s broadcast television partner, to new highs.The tournament, which takes place on April 5-11, is also aired on ESPN, a sports pay TV network owned by Walt Disney.“After a long and necessary time away from the game I feel like I’m ready to start my season at Augusta,” Mr Woods said in a statement on his official website. “Although I’m returning to competition, I still have a lot of work to do in my personal life.”Sponsors including AT&T and Accenture dropped their endorsement contracts with golf’s most bankable star, whose net worth was estimated at $1bn before the allegations surfaced.Mr Woods broke his silence in February publicly to apologise for serial infidelities. Interest in the event sent traffic soaring on websites covering the press conference. Trading volume spiked on the New York Stock Exchange after he finished speaking.He had been in therapy for the past two months, Mr Woods said in the statement.“I think the first tournament Tiger Woods plays again, wherever it is, will be the biggest media event, other than the Obama inauguration, in the past 10 or 15 years,” Sean McManus, president of CBS News and Sports said this month.More than 37m US viewers tuned into the US president’s inauguration in January 2009, the biggest audience since the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan, former US president, in 1981.The Masters, golf’s highest rated tournament, typically draws 15m-20m viewers, according to Larry Novenstern, an independent sports marketing consultant. “If Tiger’s in there, it’ll double,” Mr Novenstern added.The immediate advertising revenue impact could be minimal as advertising time was sold ahead of the tournament, experts said. CBS declined further comment.“The next tournament will reap the benefits,” Mr Novenstern said.This is the Verizon Heritage on April 15, which will also be aired on CBS. But the next big tournament is the Players Championship in Florida, where Mr Woods’ lives. This will air on NBC.CBS shares rose 1.4 per cent to $14.65, near its 52-week high, on the New York Stock Exchange.
260;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
261;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-03-09T09:58:41Z;TCS outlines its Asian ambitions;;Tata Consultancy Services, India’s leading IT and outsourcing group, hopes to quadruple its market share in Asia outside India within five to seven years, according to its top executive for the region.Girja Pande, TCS’s Asia-Pacific chairman, said the group had achieved compounded annual growth averaging 40 per cent a year in the region for the past nine years, and was budgeting for 35 per cent growth this year.“We think we can sustain these growth levels – I’m talking about the next five years – because we still have only 1 or 2 per cent market share,” Mr Pande said in an interview with the Financial Times at the group’s Singapore headquarters for Asia east of India.Mr Pande said TCS aimed to take 7 or 8 per cent of the fragmented market for IT services in the Asia Pacific region outside India, where global IT service providers such as IBM, HP Services and Accenture compete with local providers.“I think in five to seven years we should get there,” he said. “Our plans are to grow. We are positioned for growth. Our investments are for growth – whatever investments are required whether they are in brand building, adding additional sales teams, training [or] hiring.”Analysts said TCS was well positioned to increase its Asia-Pacific market share, but would have to spend heavily to build a bigger local presence and might have to cut prices below the levels achieved by its core European and North American operations.“I think they will able to give healthy competition to the incumbent players,” said Rajiv Mehta, senior research analyst at India Infoline in Mumbai. “If they compete with these local and regional vendors on price then they should be able to increase market share.”Gartner, the IT research group, said recently that IT spending in the Asia-Pacific region was expected to grow by 5 per cent in 2010 to $515.6bn.TCS said in January that global revenues for the quarter to the end of December rose by 10.3 per cent, compared with the equivalent quarter on 2008, with net profit up 38.9 per cent to $384m.The improved results followed a severe setback in 2008 as the global financial crisis hit its businesses in North America and Europe, which together account for about 80 per cent of revenues.Mr Pande said TCS expected Asia-Pacific growth in gross domestic product to outpace economic growth in Europe and North America during the next decade, steadily increasing the region’s 5.5 per cent share of TCS’s $6bn in global revenues.However, he said growth was also being driven by a move towards global procurement of IT services by major multinationals that were dramatically reducing the number of suppliers they were willing to deal with.This had helped TCS to pick up contracts from companies such as BP, the UK oil company, which had not previously been a customer, he said.Mr Pande said the group expected to grow in Asia, mainly by expanding its relationships with existing customers and adding new ones, but was also open to potential acquisitions.“We are a cash-rich company, sitting on a billion and a half [dollars] in cash,” he said. “We are always looking for opportunities, and we believe this is a good time to be looking. We are looking closely.”
262;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-03-08T17:45:18Z;Smarter leaders are betting big on data;Analytics could be the secret of business success;Last week a very wise man – OK, it was my chief executive – said a smart thing. “Data is the new plastics,” he declared. This was a sly reference to a famous scene in the film The Graduate. What he meant, I think, was that the unlikely subject of data has suddenly become fashionable. It is now the sort of discipline you might encourage your son or daughter to pursue.Clever people talk knowingly about “analytics” – managing better with the use of data – as if they have discovered the secret of business success. Perhaps they have. Software companies are certainly pushing the concept hard.Last month the consultants Accenture announced a partnership with the IT company SAS. They are forming an analytics group which will offer what they call “predictive solutions”. This means getting hold of useful data fast and interpreting them intelligently, to try to anticipate sudden changes in your market, or to spot gaps others have not yet seen. IBM is touting its analytics capabilities aggressively, while SAP is also talking a good analytics game.I was recently given a briefing by Vivek Ranadivé, the chief executive of Tibco, a Nasdaq-listed software company, on the emerging possibilities of our data-rich world. Mr Ranadivé is something of a visionary in this field. His first book, The Power of Now, was published 11 years ago. This was followed in 2006 by The Power to Predict. His latest book, The Two Second Advantage, will be out this year.Mr Ranadivé is dismissive of what he considers outdated approaches to the handling of data. “We have 20th-century infrastructure trying to solve 21st-century problems,” he says.During the past two decades, companies have become good at storing large amounts of data. Databases contain historical information about transactions that have been carried out. But what about all those near-misses, when customers visit your website, stay a while but leave without buying anything? A passive database will not record any of that activity. It will not even know that such things have happened.Mr Ranadivé says we should think of business in terms of events, not transactions. Near-misses are customer events, too. The latest approach to data tries to spot these events in real time, so businesses can make use of that information quickly. In the jargon, this is called “in-memory analytics”, so called because memory has become a cheap and almost infinite commodity, and all that customer activity can be monitored live, as it happens.Faster transmission of information makes a lot of things possible: marketing campaigns that react quickly to what customers want, smoother-functioning supply chains, even the introduction of the “smart grid”, which can spot possible power outages much sooner.Last month Thomas Davenport, professor at Babson College, and Jeanne Harris, director of research at Accenture’s high performance institute, published Analytics at Work, a primer for managers who want to introduce a more rigorous approach to the use of data. It is a challenging read, in part because it makes plain how much work has to be done to capture and use data effectively.But even academic experts agree that, however sophisticated your approach to data, you still need judgment to make good decisions. When Prof Davenport met a pilot at a party and started discussing analytics, he received this reply: “Oh yes, we’ve got lots of that in modern airliners – avionics, lots of computers, ‘fly by wire’, and all that. But I still occasionally find it useful to look out the window.”Others are even more sceptical. Paco Underhill, a retail guru and chief executive of the consultancy Envirosell, says that today it is almost too easy to accumulate data. Instead of going to witness things first-hand, managers do a lot of their thinking sitting down, staring at spreadsheets. He is a great advocate of rubber-soled shoes. Get away from your desk, he says, and go and see for yourself. Wear rubber soles at your Envirosell interview if you want to get hired, Mr Underhill advises.Not everyone will be fired up by the idea of plunging deep into a world of data. In the 1960s, bright young graduates, like the Dustin Hoffman character in the movie, did not all choose to pursue a career in plastics. But one young chap at General Electric did. Welch, I think his name was. Things seemed to work out pretty well for him.stefan.stern@ft.comFor more go to www.ft.com/managementblog
263;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-03-07T22:34:43Z;The careerist: Pro bono work;‘You have graduates reporting directly to the chairman’;"Pro bono work is usually thought of as the preserve of lawyers, but organisations as varied as advertising agencies and professional services firms also donate their staff’s time to good causes – either for free or for reduced fees. Although employees should do pro bono work for selfless reasons, your good deeds can also be rewarded in terms of your career.How does pro bono work add to my experience?
If you are relatively junior, it can be a very good way to step up. “People who do pro bono work in the Accenture Development Partnerships typically take on more senior roles than they would in big corporate roles,” says Royce Bell, a senior executive at the consultancy firm. “You get to see a lot of nuts and bolts and it’s very good to get outside the normal cosy corporate world. You’d think that someone who sets up an IT system in Chad would have a broader view than a person who has only worked in Fortune 200 companies.”Six years ago, Maya Mehta, a senior associate at Clifford Chance, the law firm, set up the legal advice surgery for the Newham Asian Women’s Project in London. “It’s a great way to sharpen your skills as a lawyer,” she says. “Particularly with the high level of client contact and range of issues. As a trainee in Hong Kong, working with Filipino women who had been abused made me realise how much I could help others just by applying basic legal skills.”What about opportunities for building relationships?
Pro bono work often brings together people from different parts of organisations who might not otherwise meet.Phil Georgiadis, chairman of Walker Media, the London agency, says it can cut through hierarchies, too. “I’m about to do some work for Great Ormond Street Hospital and I’ll enlist a couple of graduates to work with me – that’ll be the account team. So suddenly you have a graduate who is reporting directly to the chairman, which is very rare,” he explains.What about job satisfaction?
Using your professional skills in the service of good causes often adds a kind of ethical dimension to your career and can be very motivating. Ms Mehta says the inspiration for starting the NAWP pro bono scheme came about from reading about forced marriages and honour killings: “It got to the point where I couldn’t just turn the page. I wanted to do something about it.”She says it is also one way of bridging the divide between Canary Wharf and the less privileged areas that surround it.Pro bono work can be rewarding in other ways, too. Mr Georgiadis says you can be freer to be more creative with work done for charities: “You often have the opportunity to do some really interesting marketing and [you have more leeway] than you might have with, say, a breakfast cereal.”Mr Bell adds that ADP projects tend to be smaller and shorter than their corporate counterparts: “It’s much easier to see overall results and understand the positive effect of what you are doing.”Are there any downsides?
Those who go on long-term schemes such as the ADP may be asked to take a reduced salary – although in the case of the ADP, if you’re in Chad or Mongolia, even a reduced salary lets you live pretty well."
264;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-03-03T18:19:32Z;Football goal within Nike’s sight;;Football can become Nike’s biggest money-making sport, overtaking the long-established revenues achieved by basketball and running, the company’s brands president has said.Charlie Denson, in London to launch a range of World Cup shirts made by recycling plastic bottles, said football was in its top three categories, along with basketball and running, and that sales numbers between them were very close.“The assumption is it could definitely be number one. We dominate the basketball category, and our basketball footprint is an aspiration for all the other categories,” said Mr Denson, without giving a timescale.“We will grow faster in our overall business in football, because we don’t own as big a share [of the market]. But basketball as a sport may grow faster than football on a global basis, just because [football] is so omnipresent already.”Nike is sponsoring 10 teams in the World Cup, including Brazil, Portugal and the Netherlands but, as in the 2006 tournament in Germany, it must contend with rival Adidas’ ability to dominate the advertising space ahead of and during the tournament in South Africa this summer as an official Fifa sponsor.In addition, Adidas is sponsoring 12 teams, and providing match balls and kit for match officials. Independent research groups put Adidas as the market share leader in football-related products.It will continue as official sponsor for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.Nike, which in December reported a 4 per cent fall in second-quarter revenues, does not break out sales across sports categories. It purchased UK-based football kit manufacturer Umbro in 2008, and next year begins an eight-year deal with the French Football Federation as the official supplier of the national team, replacing Adidas.“We are in our teenage years as far as the maturity of our brand within the football community,” Mr Denson said.Football is Nike’s number one sport outside the US, and in the middle of the last decade Nike sales internationally overtook US sales. But football was also a big seller in the US.Mr Denson said Nike was comfortable with a strategy of sponsoring World Cup teams rather than the tournament. “[Tournament sponsorships] are very, very large commitments and we’re just not at the point where we’ve engaged in those at that level.”The 13m discarded plastic bottles being used for the recycled World Cup shirts come from landfill sites in Japan and Taiwan, and represents a 30 per cent saving on energy consumption and raw materials.Mr Denson said the new shirts may cost more for Nike to produce, but were financially sustainable because of savings in other parts of the production process. “The consumer won’t be penalised.”
265;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-23T23:19:21Z;Intel takes helm of scheme to enhance US competitiveness;;An alliance of 25 venture capitalists led by the investment arm of the chipmaker Intel has announced a $3.5bn fund to boost US competitiveness in technology.Intel, the world’s biggest maker of semiconductors, also made a pledge with 16 other companies to increase hiring of US college graduates in 2010.The initiatives, in a speech by Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, at Washington’s Brookings Institution, follow concerns expressed by technology leaders that the US is falling behind other countries in the pace of investment in innovation.”Unfortunately, long-term investments in education, research, digital technology and human capital have been steadily declining in the US,” said Mr Otellini.”So too has the commitment to policies that made us such an entrepreneurial powerhouse for more than a century. This is the bitter truth and we don’t hear enough about it.”Mr Otellini pointed to a 2009 study of how much countries were doing to make themselves more innovative. The US ranked last of 40 countries.He criticised a relative decline in tax credits given to businesses that invest in research and development. Immigration policies seemed deliberately designed to prevent the US from attracting the best minds in the world, he added, due to the ”tiny allotment” of visas for foreign-born engineers and scientists.The Invest in America Alliance he announced is to invest $3.5bn in US-based technology companies during the next two years, including a new $200m fund established by the Intel Capital venture arm. Clean technology, information technology and biotechnology will be targeted.Intel and 16 other companies, including Accenture, Adobe, Broadcom, Cisco, Dell, eBay, EMC, GE, Google, HP, Microsoft and Yahoo have made a commitment to as much as double their hiring of college graduates, to form 10,500 new jobs.

267;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-21T22:53:01Z;India’s Wipro heads for cloud computer land;;At Bangalore-based Wipro Technologies, India’s third largest information technology outsourcing company, an important experiment is under way.About 500 employees are hooked up to a central computing “cloud” – a collection of shared servers and software – in a pilot programme to study the potential of a trend that could change the way the outsourcing industry works.The pilot found that, whereas in the past, an employee at an outsourcing company might take about 43 days to set up a new project, including sourcing servers and hiring staff, it can take about 36 minutes to set up on a cloud network, says Girish Paranjpe, Wipro co-chief executive. With just a password, all the necessary computing power and software is available on the cloud.“The potential is huge,” says Mr Paranjpe.Cloud computing – in which customers ultimately buy computing power and services and applications over the internet from a third party – is poised to become the new battlefield between Indian and global IT outsourcing companies.Indian groups Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Technologies and Wipro, lead an industry that expects to report revenue from services exports of $56bn by March 2011, up 13 per cent on a year earlier. Opposite them is the global outsourcing sector, including US-based IBM and Accenture and France’s Cap Gemini.Until now, the typical customer of these firms has kept much of its IT hardware in-house and bought and maintained its own software. Within large companies, different divisions will have their own servers and hardware, leading to duplication and an excess of computing power across the organisation.Wipro calculates that because of this the world’s servers are running at only 27 per cent capacity.With cloud computing customers purchase computing power and applications on a pay per use basis. This is much like how a consumer uses electricity, paying only when the lights are on.Mr Paranjpe calculates that cloud computing can increase server usage to 75 per cent of capacity. Others say it can reduce computing costs for companies to a tenth of their former levels.For India’s computer services companies, cloud computing offers a chance to capture a client’s entire IT budget and a large part of their business process work, for instance, their billing and customer relationship management functions.“It’s a huge opportunity – you’re already managing the software, data and infrastructure of your clients,” said Pramod Bhasin, chairman of Nasscom, India’s outsourcing industry body. “Now you have a far greater ability to provide that on a much cheaper level to [parts] of the world which today remain underserved for IT.”But to capture this business, outsourcing companies need strong consultancy practices to work with the chief executives of their customers.Western groups have an edge over their Indian rivals because of their large better established consulting divisions.Cloud computing’s rise is fuelling consolidation in the global industry. Dell’s $3.9bn acquisition of Perot Systems last year married hardware with consultancy services. Hewlett-Packard paid $14bn for services business EDS in 2008.India’s outsourcing companies, minnows compared with their international peers, might be forced to think about consolidation. So far most, like Wipro, are experimenting only with internal clouds.“The private cloud computing solutions are working very well but there is still a long way to go in the public cloud computing domain to address data security and privacy,” says Kumar Parakala, global head of sourcing advisory at KPMG.
268;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-21T18:12:15Z;New rules hit US credit card issuers;;US credit card issuers are facing a $12bn revenue shortfall this year from price limitations imposed by new rules that take effect on Monday, according to an analysis by law firm Morrison Foerster.Over five years, the overall hit to the industry could exceed $50bn, analysts and industry groups said.The new rules, known as the Card Act, prohibit interest rate increases on existing balances and require card issuers to give 45 days’ notice before raising rates on future balances. Also outlawed are automatic overdraft fees and surcharges for paying bills by phone.Card issuers are scrambling to offset that lost revenue with cost cuts, the easiest way being to weed out the riskiest borrowers.Morrison Foerster, which worked with a group of big issuers to quantify the impact of the Card Act and provided its findings to the US Federal Reserve, concluded that some 45.5m people, or 20 per cent of the US population, could find themselves without cards as a result.But cost cuts alone will not be enough. Eventually, issuers will need to introduce products that generate higher fees – a process that might be starting to happen.Tysis, a card processing company, recently introduced a new system that allows cardholders to pay for certain transactions as they occur rather than at the end of the month, like a typical credit card.Transactions can be pre-screened based on dollar volume or type, so any transaction under $100, for instance, could be paid immediately.Cardholders get the ability to better manage their finances at a time when lines of credit are shrinking.But the system also encourages holders to use the card more frequently, generating higher interchange fees, which a merchant’s bank pays to a card-issuing bank.“Fee income will become even more important going forward,” said Robert Hammer, an industry consultant. He estimates that income from all types of fees totals 47 per cent of credit card revenue, up from 35 per cent five years ago.“Over the next two to three years, fee income will surpass interest income – and that’s never happened in the history of the credit card industry,” he said.A few big banks have publicly quantified the revenue they expect to lose as a result of the Card Act.JPMorgan Chase said the new rules could cost it up to $750m this year. Citigroup put the cost at $600m in 2010.But some of the Card Act restrictions have yet to be felt. Issuers are waiting for soon-to-be released Federal Reserve rules on which penalties are considered “reasonable and proportional”.Currently, cardholders with a $3,000 balance could see minimum monthly payments jump by more than 40 per cent if they are late with a payment.“It’s hard to justify that type of increase as reason-able,” said Nick Bourke, the manager of the Pew Safe Credit Cards Project.
269;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-19T17:51:25Z;Tiger Woods confesses amid media frenzy;;Tiger Woods, one of the world’s most bankable sportsmen, confirmed serial infidelities in a carefully staged television apology, but left sponsors, broadcasters and a ravenous press pack guessing about when he might return to competitive golf.Mr Woods was trailed by television helicopters on his way to and from his appearance.Obsessive media interest in Mr Woods’ statement, which was carried live on dozens of US television channels as well as websites from TMZ.com to YouTube, heightened expectations that his eventual return to golf will generate record audiences.His televised apology boosted traffic to ESPN.com and Yahoo, and instantly became the hottest topic on Twitter and Google’s search engine as he admitted: ”I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated.”The Tiger effect was felt even at the New York Stock Exchange, where trading volumes suddenly spiked once he finished speaking.Millions of dollars in endorsement fees, prize money and broadcast rights rest on his eventual return to the PGA Tour, but on this subject he said little. “I will return to golf one day. I just don’t know when that will be,” he said, although he did not rule out a comeback this year.Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS, highlighted broadcasters’ hopes for a successful comeback, telling analysts on Thursday: “Being the network with the largest number of golf events, the return of Tiger Woods is a welcome one.”The breach of Mr Woods’ clean-cut image tarnished his brand, but advertising executives have pointed to dramatic comebacks in the past, such as Kate Moss’s renewed commercial success after cocaine allegations rattled her sponsors.The world’s number one golfer offered thanks to the PGA Tour and to “my friends at Accenture,” his largest sponsor before it axed a six-year campaign in December featuring the slogan “Go on. Be a Tiger”.Mr Woods’ statement fell in the middle of this week’s World Match Play Championship, which Accenture is sponsoring. Nike, another long-term sponsor, restated its support for the golfer and said it looked forward to his return.Mr Woods’ net worth was estimated at about $1bn before lurid speculation about his personal life exploded after a small car accident outside his house one night last November.He was by turns penitent and angry as he deprived a ravenous media pack of details of his infidelities, forcefully denied speculation about domestic violence and performance -enhancing drug use and attacked the pursuit of his wife, mother and children by paparazzi, saying: ”Leave my wife and kids alone.”A poised Mr Woods declined to take questions from reporters as he apologised to his family, friends and fans, said he would return to therapy, and ended by hugging his mother.He offered little explanation of his behaviour, but said: “I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn’t have to go far to find them.”
270;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-18T18:10:59Z;Capgemini sees upturn after 60% fall in profits;;Capgemini reported a 60 per cent slump in profits for 2009, but said it was now poised for recovery as companies started spending on computer systems again.“Demand is still relatively mediocre, but there are signs of a thaw. We are seeing far less price negotiation and we are starting to see bigger systems integration deals in the pipeline. It has been mainly €2m to €10m deals last year but now there is a surge for €10m to €50m deals,” said Paul Hermelin, chief executive.Mr Hermelin added that he was still determined to make a number of acquisitions in the US to boost Capgemini’s presence in the market, where it languishes in 17th position by size. Mr Hermelin has previously said he would like the company to be among the top five in the US.“We should be ready at the end of the downturn to seize opportunities. Now that we are feeling safer it is time to act,” he said.He added that he was looking at acquisitions of around €100m. He is also interested in deals to boost Capgemini’s presence in China and Latin America.Capgemini, which competes with the likes of Accenture and Atos Origin to provide IT services for companies and government departments, saw revenues fall 5.5 per cent to €8.37bn last year as companies cut back spending computer spending. The company was forced to warn on sales last November.Net profits fell to €178m from €450m the previous year. This in part reflected the fact that France’s largest IT services company was forced to spend €213m restructuring the business, including laying off just over 5000 people and moving many of its operations to lower-cost regions like India. Nearly a third of staff is now located offshore.However, last December, the company became a net hirer again, taking on more people than it was laying off, another sign that it expects market recovery.Mr Hermelin remained cautious about 2010, saying he expected a further 2 to 4 per cent decline in revenues 2010, while operating margins are expected to slip to between 6 and 6.5 per cent from 7.1 per cent last year.Earnings per share were €1.16 compared with €3.09 previously and the company is to pay a dividend of €0.80 per share.Shares in Capgemini, which have gained more than 36 per cent in value in the past year, rose 6.19 per cent to €33.65 as investors were reassured by Mr Hermelin’s comments on an industry upturn.
271;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-15T11:40:16Z;Does IT work?: Mobile apps making real difference in many sectors;;The market for mobile applications is growing at a frenetic rate. Gartner, the analytic company, expects revenue from applications – across all the main mobile platforms – to grow from $4.2bn in 2009 to $29.5bn in 2013.This growth is all the more impressive, considering that a market for downloading mobile phone applications hardly existed before Apple launched its iPhone in 2007.The vast bulk of those downloads are based around entertainment or personal productivity. But business software vendors are starting to wake up to the possibilities, as chief information officers, for example, become increasingly willing to use mobile business applications and distribute them via applications stores.This is the approach adopted by the French arm of Generali, the life assurance provider. The company approached Accenture, the IT consultant, to write an iPhone application.The app is aimed at self-employed financial advisers who sell Generali products. They can download the software directly from Apple’s iPhone app store and use it to track clients’ portfolios via a 3G or wi-fi connection. The app provides simple graphical representations of clients’ holdings and asset allocations.According to Bertrand Boré, director of internet and distribution strategy at Generali France, a smartphone is simply a better tool to help advisers do business, especially when they visit clients.“We were already quite advanced in providing online information to financial advisers,” he says. “But we were meeting a limit with the need for a wi-fi connection, and to take a laptop. If you are in a meeting with a client, it is not that easy to connect yourself, whether it is in a coffee bar or their office. So we built on the mobile concept to give advisers that information anywhere.”In the US, Nationwide, the insurer, pursued a strategy of developing mobile applications that are not specific to a single platform. The company’s mobile staff mostly use BlackBerrys, but, says Robert Burkhart, head of technology innovation, there are also users with iPhones, the Droid (a phone from Motorola that uses the Android operating system), Symbian and Windows Mobile.“We are now also asking whether it has to be a company-owned phone or whether it could be a personal device. We want to protect our data and our intellectual property, but we also want to ensure that we see the productivity gains associated with giving staff the information they need to do the job,” he says.Despite the extra efforts involved, developing specific mobile business applications rather than relying on web applications pays off in improved functionality and productivity, Mr Burkhart argues.“For the best experience, it is better not to have a web-based version [of the application] but one that is specific, depending on what the user is doing. It is about having right functionality.”It is not just a question of designing applications so they fit on a mobile device’s smaller screen, he says, but providing the right amount of task-specific information to field-based staff. Too often, re-purposed PC or web applications produce cluttered screens, and frustrated users.Paying close attention to mobile workers’ needs also pays dividends in industrial and blue-collar applications.For example, JCDecaux, the outdoor advertising company, developed a field-based app for staff and subcontractors installing billboards and posters. The app allows the installers to photograph when each poster goes up, and provide a GPS location and time stamp via a smartphone.JCDecaux customers can also view the images, taken by the Windows Mobile devices, in near real time, allowing them to track the roll-out of their campaigns.The project, developed with PA Consulting and Vodafone, involved fine-tuning settings on the handsets, in particular to boost performance of the onboard camera in poor lighting, so crews do not need conventional cameras and do not have to load images to a PC before sending them to clients.It is not only custom-built apps being used by business. Chevron, the oil company, is trialling an iPhone-based version of Nimbus Control, a business process management package.This, says Jim Boots, senior BPM adviser at Chevron, will enable the company to deliver up-to-date process information to staff anywhere around its plants. The vast size of oil refineries puts a strain on conventional IT tools and connectivity. Maintenance engineers, for example, will be able to view the latest guidance on servicing or repairs directly from a device.Modern smartphones stand out from industrial devices for their ease of use and clear screens. “We have tended to use heavy-duty devices and there are certain requirements for our environment,” says Mr Boots. “But people already use their phones here without wrecking them.”
272;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-14T21:53:58Z;Asia to reverse IT outsource trend;;Spending on IT outsourcing will grow faster among Asian companies than their western counterparts in 2010, Dell Services estimates, reversing the trend of recent years that has seen more western groups buying services from India and China.Jim Champy, chairman of Dell Services’ consulting practice, says IT outsourcing is set to rise in Asian markets as the region’s companies begin to modernise their business processes and technology systems in a build-out that could last decades.“We see, as most providers do, the Asian markets growing faster – clearly more than Europe, and certainly faster than the US,” Mr Champy told the Financial Times.“What it would feel like to me is two to three times faster, percentage-wise.”His comments come as the IT and business process outsourcing industry, which handles everything from computer systems and software to billing and customer records, is seeking a different direction following the economic crisis.At India’s principal IT conference last week, organised by the industry body Nasscom, a report by KPMG and the Asian-Oceanian Computing Industry Organisation predicted a sharp rise in Asia’s share of the world’s IT services spend.It forecast that Asia would account for 26.3 per cent of the global consumption of IT and business-process outsourcing services in the next decade, up from nearly 20 per cent currently.This increase represents a reversal of the trend whereby Indian IT companies have sent executives to developed markets to try to steal business from established western outsourcing consultancies, such as IBM and Accenture.The Indian outsourcing industry has thrived as a result. Over the past two decades, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that Nasscom expects to generate exports of $56bn by March next year.
273;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-12T15:27:04Z;Industry companies and their expectations of MBAs;;What falls under the category of “industry” according to SDA Bocconi’s Career Development Services is all those companies that provide products and services excluding consultancy companies and companies working in finance. This month is the high recruiting season of the companies that fall under this category.Last week and this, we not only had a new consultancy company, Accenture visiting SDA Bocconi premises, but also had industry company presentations such as Whirlpool, Shire Pharmaceuticals, Louis Vuitton Italy, Yoox, Vodafone Italy and Exxon Mobil.After listening to presentations of some of these companies and the information they give about their 2010 summer internship projects, I cannot help but worry about the phrase “Italian is not a must, but a plus for this position”.When I rephrase this sentence in my head, it sounds something like this: “Well as an international student you can try and apply to this position with your beginner/intermediate level of Italian, but don’t keep your hopes high.”Choosing an MBA programme in Italy, I was determined to learn Italian language before the summer of 2010. But with the intensity of the regular classes, group projects, applications etc, unfortunately I cannot spare as much time to learn Italian as I would like. And Italian has turned out to be quite a hard language after all.I will try my chances with the Italian branches of companies (some corporates visiting look for interns for the Italian branch only) anyway, while applying to positions in big corporates where they recruit interns for branches all over the world, including countries where I might have a greater chance like my home country or the UK.

According to Shannon Maynard, the organization’s director, the grant will about triple the its annual budget.Its 3,000 volunteers, who come from companies such as Accenture, Best Buy and JPMorgan, have in turn contributed more than $2.3m in in-kind services in nine countries, including Haiti, India and China.“Bankers without Borders’ volunteers are helping to give poor people greater access to financial services and information technology by helping microfinance organisations and technology-for-development initiatives improve their operations, develop new products, and reach more clients,” Alex Counts, chief executive of the Grameen Foundation, said in a statement.Volunteers have analysed foreign currency risks for a microfinance lender in Indonesia, helped pilot a point-of-sale device in Ghana that enables microfinance customers to repay loans and make deposits remotely, and evaluated potential investments for Grameen.
275;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-04T10:54:22Z;Moving from ‘what happened?’ to ‘now what?’ is vital for business;;As they emerge from a period of profound recession and extreme volatility, organisations face a new competitive landscape – one in which rapid communications, proliferating data and fast-evolving customer segments are combining to create opportunities, but also complex risks.To succeed as agile and adaptable players in this environment, companies must be able to get the right information to the right people across the business – equipping them to understand their organisation’s current health and future potential.This is underlined by recent Accenture research. In a 2009 survey of 600 senior managers at more than 500 UK and US blue-chip organisations, two-thirds of all respondents cited “getting their data in order” as an immediate priority.Longer term, the top objective for between two-thirds and three-quarters of executives is to develop the ability to model and predict behaviours and actions to the point where individual decisions can be made in real time, based on the analysis at hand.If they are to realise this objective, organisations must move fast. Almost 40 per cent of companies in our survey believe their current technological resources and systems significantly hinder the effective use of enterprise-wide analytics, but the momentum is here.Whether it be the roll-out of a smart-grid, a clinical data management program or fraud and risk analysis, analytics is clearly on the agenda for leading organisations.So what next? There is a clear sequence of actions that needs to be followed as organisations move towards more sophisticated analytics capabilities.First, companies need to understand what analytics really means. Critically, it is about much more than the collection and storage of data.Rather, it should be synonymous with an integrated framework that employs quantitative methods to derive actionable insights from data – using those insights to shape business decisions and, ultimately, improve outcomes.The next immediate need is for organisations to be confident that they have the right data – and are asking the right questions.All too often, in our experience, organisations that do make analytics-based decisions are making fundamental choices based on flawed data. Issues of accuracy and format, as well as data security concerns, are conspiring to undermine what should be a powerful decision-making tool.Indeed, our survey showed companies across most sectors accepting the importance of getting their data in order before undertaking any more ambitious analytics-based initiatives.Once their data is in order, they should move fast to develop a deeper understanding of customers, markets and competitors. From that point, systems must be developed to enable automated responses based on events.And for those seeking analytical differentiation, there are two further levels of capability – first, modelling and predicting behaviours and actions and, finally, real-time optimisation through analytics.Cultural change is important too. To deliver value throughout the business, predictive analytics must be driven top-down. But with so much senior decision-making grounded in gut instinct, any broad-based commitment to analytics is still lacking.And even where this capability is used, it is frequently restricted to the context of market growth. This ignores its potential for predicting future business events, particularly where competitor activities, supply-chain needs, risk management and skills requirements are concerned.For as long as companies only use analytics in limited ways, they will be limiting their capacity to succeed.Our research showed that of the companies that claim to have an integrated performance management capability in place, only around 20 per cent have any proven links between the metrics they measure and the outcomes the metrics are intended to drive.Increasingly, we should expect to see the new generation of analytical leaders demanding more – particularly in light of growing financial oversight requirements and the accelerating importance of customer-centricity.The companies that thrived in the wake of earlier recessions were demonstrably those that used data-derived insights made by informed decision-makers to generate lasting competitive advantage.This time round, while the challenge of recovery is far stiffer, companies can leverage rapid advances in technology to tame the deluge of data and enable rapid, intuitive decision-making.Within every organisation, information and systems can now be integrated to support enterprise-wide performance management initiatives. Crucially too, IT infrastructure components and software programs have matured to a point where they can be used to automate decisions and integrate directly into business processes.Thanks to these developments, we have moved from descriptive analytics (answering the “what happened?”) to predictive analytics (answering the “now what?”).Predictive analytics use the outputs of descriptive analytics – combined with more sophisticated statistical modelling, forecasting and optimisation techniques – to anticipate the impact on business outcomes. These highly evolved analytical capabilities are especially valuable across functions, where the causal linkages between business processes can be understood and acted upon.These developments have occurred not a moment too soon. Enterprises today must compete on the “now what?” level. Looking back and learning from experience in disciplines such as customer-centricity, operational excellence and enterprise management is no longer enough.The next generation of competitive strategy and management science has arrived. Only by competing on analytics can businesses achieve sustainable success by driving growth, enhancing cost and cash advantage, restructuring the business at scale and winning the war for talent.
276;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-02-03T16:46:45Z;The UK’s new energy policy;The government should support the market, not distort it;"It was 145 years ago that William Jevons first articulated energy’s central importance to British success. “With coal almost any feat is possible; without it we are thrown back into the poverty of early times.”Jevons did not foresee the rise of North Sea gas, which buttressed the liberalisation policies of Margaret Thatcher. But now that resource is almost depleted, and with the decline has come a dramatic change in energy policy too. Before, the main concerns were cost and efficiency. Now they are carbon emissions and security of supply. Britain is struggling with the change. Paradoxically for a country that once made privatisation its calling card, regulator Ofgem does not believe the answer lies with free markets. The reason is that the investments required are too large, the technologies too unproven, and the returns too uncertain for the private sector to ever stump up. The state needs to intervene – even up to establishing a monopsonistic state-owned energy buyer.This conforms to the free market backlash. Guaranteeing returns would also almost certainly summon forth higher private investment – and higher bills. It is also unnecessary. For example, a tidal generator may require a guaranteed minimum carbon price to be built. But that could be done, without distorting the whole carbon market, by the government issuing specific projects with contracts for difference that pay out if carbon falls below a certain price, and “pay in” if it rises above. Similarly, as Accenture suggests, the state could provide construction loan guarantees for large nuclear projects. Backstopping this risk would encourage investment; in return the generator pays an insurance premium that contributes to future decommissioning costs. In the competition for capital, such targeted incentives would attract the investment the UK needs to expand its energy capacity – without the need for a volte-face.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallySweeping reforms of the UK’s energy market must be brought in urgently to protect energy supplies, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and deliver the £200bn investment needed in the power sector, the energy regulator said.Ofgem said options for reform would include placing more stringent legal obligations on energy suppliers, and “improved market signals”, which could include a higher price on carbon dioxide emissions. More drastic options could include a centralised renewables market and a central buyer of energy for the whole of the UK.Without reform, the regulator signalled, there was a clear risk to energy supplies. Alistair Buchanan, chief executive of Ofgem, said: “There is an increasing consensus that leaving the present system of market arrangements and other incentives unchanged is not an option.”"

Verdict:

During last month’s pandemonium over Tiger Woods’s extramarital affairs, one of the companies that appeared most exposed was Accenture. The consultancy’s sponsorship and advertising campaigns had aligned its image with that of the golfer for six of the nine years since the brand’s inception.Accenture is rolling out a campaign that launched just five weeks after it axed its deal with Woods. Perhaps counter-intuitively, rather than opt for a clean break and new direction, it has retained the look and tone of its previous ads. Taglines that had highlighted Woods’s sporting dexterity have evolved rather than been replaced – with lines such as “Who says you can’t be big and nimble?” alongside an image of a surfing elephant. Another poster features a soaring frog alongside the line “Play quantum leapfrog”.As a result, the campaign provides freshness without sacrificing continuity – ensuring the millions of dollars Accenture has spent building its image over the years has not been thrown away. The speed of the campaign’s deployment is also notable – Accenture tests alternative campaigns regularly and so had one on hand.Given the nature of its consulting services, the ads need to rely on metaphors that can translate around the world. The elephants, frogs, fish and reptiles are, therefore, ideal replacement ambassadors. But it would perhaps be wise to keep its burgeoning zoo free of tigers."
278;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-01-25T00:01:38Z;Real deals;;"As political leaders around the world grapple with how to reduce the emissions that cause climate change, several US companies have signed up to an intern scheme that puts some of the brightest MBA students to work on lowering energy consumption.The non-profit Environmental Defense Fund’s Climate Corps programme recently completed its second summer of “embedding” interns from universities including Yale, Duke and Stanford at a group of companies that includes Sony Pictures Entertainment, Cisco Systems and Accenture.MBA students such as Russell Baruffi served as an intern for 10 weeks and focused on analysing energy consumption in an attempt to find possible savings.Baruffi attends the Ross School of Business and School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan, where he is a fellow at the Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise. His internship was with Sony Pictures, the Hollywood studio behind recent hits such as 2012 and District 9.“I was very interested in Sony for a number of reasons,” explains Baruffi. “I wanted to work on energy efficiency and renewables projects for a large, publicly held corporate entity so I could better understand the operational processes and motivations that drove decision-making.”Sony, for its part, is keen to lower emissions associated with its sprawling studio lot in Culver City, California. As the site of the original Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, the lot and its many sound stages, is steeped in history.“We have a very unique situation,” says Jeff Hargleroad, executive vice-president of corporate operations at Sony Pictures Entertainment. The site is 80 years old and includes dozens of buildings, which complicates matters. “We have stages and facilities that are inefficient because they were built so long ago,” he says. “A couple of years ago, our corporate leadership decided to make our green effort more meaningful.”Every part of the company was asked to examine its energy use and carbon footprint. “We looked at where we could save power, water and how we could improve our waste management,” he says.Baruffi provided a fresh, analytical perspective, says Hargleroad. Crucially, all of his time during the 10-week internship was devoted to energy efficiency. “Russell did a number of things, such as evaluating where our money was being spent in terms of utilities,” says Hargleroad. “We also have a number of data centres, which can be a real energy hog and by having them, we lose certain efficiencies.“He evaluated different data centres … and put together a plan showing what we could save. What I liked about it in comparison with some of the consultants that we might have had around [in the past] was that he had a broader background in business. Some of the consultants we have used before tend to be so focused on green issues that they didn’t have any awareness of capital.”In their eagerness to improve the company’s energy efficiency, these consultants did not appreciate that the studio “could not be taken off-line for days at a time”, Hargleroad adds. “Russell offered a more pragmatic approach.”Baruffi says he put many of the skills taught in his MBA to good use while at Sony.“I needed to use financial analysis and my understanding of organisational dynamics. Even my marketing skills were critical.” He says he had to know which executive to target and also “how to communicate a clear value proposition about the project’s importance”.Once he found the right person to pitch to, he had to present a solid case for making changes. “It’s not always apparent that adding additional costs for energy efficiency to a budget makes sense,” he says. “So you have to be very deliberative to make a pitch and make the business case to the right individual.”Hargleroad says having a fresh perspective was beneficial to Sony. “Having Russell bring those disciplines to our analysis was very helpful,” he says.Sony had explored some of the energy-efficiency issues analysed by Baruffi before, including the company’s solar power portfolio and its storm water discharge systems. “We had some level of analysis on all of those fronts,” says Hargleroad. “What Russell did was peel back the layers to give us more data, as well as move things along more quickly.”Baruffi was not alone in making a positive contribution during his internship, with other participants in the Climate Corps scheme completing research that was welcomed by the companies they worked with.The Environmental Defense Fund’s intern at Cisco found that minor increases in the ambient temperature of data centres could save the company about 18m KW of electricity – and $1.8m each year.The EDF intern at TXU Energy’s two main office buildings found ways to reduce energy consumption by 10 per cent and 30 per cent respectively, generating a potential annual saving of $200,000.“Several of the interns in our programme have been hired [by the participating companies] to work on energy efficiency.” says Gwen Ruta, vice-president of corporate partnerships at EDF. “The companies that have hired them have recognised the value [of energy efficiency] and decided to make the necessary investments.”Participating interns can have a considerable impact, she adds. “They can overcome everyday barriers. They can look beyond departmental boundaries and bridge the gap between facilities people and the chief financial officer.“They have been incredibly effective in not only finding the opportunities but finding them in a way that convinces the companies to act on them.”EDF stays in close contact with the participating companies, which report to the organisation at the end of the internship and then again a year later.The programme has been popular: this year, 26 MBA students took part and Ruta says the organisation aims to enlist 50 participating companies in 2010.Participating MBA students tend to approach the programme with genuine enthusiasm and want to come up with effective – and cost-effective – ways of fighting climate change, she adds. “The other part of the programme that is really valuable is we’re helping to create the next generation of business leaders. They develop an understanding of the strategic value of environmentalism that is not typically taught.”………………………………To be an internOne of the selling points of a two-year MBA programme is that it includes an internship – a 10-12-week work placement, writes Linda Anderson.MBA students with a year of business school under their belts take time out from their studies to work in a variety of sectors and fields, before returning to school and the second half of their programme.According to data collected by the Financial Times, internships are most popular in North American schools, where the two-year programme predominates. They do not feature as frequently in Europe, where one-year programmes are more common, and participants do not have the luxury of taking 2-3 months out.According to Financial Times statistics, while almost 80 per cent of MBA students in the North American class of 2006 completed an internship as part of their programme, that figure fell to 42 per cent in Europe.An internship allows students to work for a time with a prospective employer, says Julie Morton, associate dean of career services at Chicago Booth School of Business in the US. It provides the student with a time to reflect on whether they really want to pursue that particular career. For some, an internship can be a real eye-opener. Having begun their internship at a consultancy, students can realise the job is not for them. Perhaps it is insufficiently hands-on, or not as people-orientated as they had hoped. Whatever the outcome, MBAs return to school for the second year of the programme with a “more refined sense of what their goals are”, says Morton. “It gives them insight.”“An internship allows them to take the skills they have learned in the classroom and apply them in a company setting,” says Tracee Petrillo, director of the Center for Career Development and assistant dean at the Olin Graduate School of Business at Babson College.In addition to bringing their own MBA talents into the internship setting, participants also learn from the company. Though the internship experience is relatively short, it is intense. Such a full-throttle experience eventually finds its way back into the classroom. “They certainly come back with examples of what they see being done in the real world,” says Morton.At the MIT Sloan School of Management, a popular elective for students returning from their summer internship involves reflection on the practice of management. As part of the course, students are asked to think of their internship as a project, and consider what they would do differently and what they learned.One obvious aspect of an internship is the possibility of a full-time job offer at the end of it. “From the company’s perspective, it is a 12-week job interview,” says Petrillo. “It gives the company the opportunity to try someone out in a low-risk setting.” Companies can see if their MBA interns are a good fit, whether they are team players and would be an asset to the company.At Sloan, about 35 per cent of students who are offered a full-time position as a result of their internship accept a job. At Chicago, about 50 per cent of students receive offers from their summer internships; for the class of 2009, 75-80 per cent accepted the offer. According to Financial Times data, of those who completed an internship, two-thirds were offered a job at the end of it.However, some students accept an internship with no intention of taking a full-time position, even if it is offered. Some, says Jackie Wilbur, career director at Sloan, want to use it to learn something new; some are sponsored, and others use it as a stepping stone to a job elsewhere.Companies, too, can have alternative agendas. Some see interns as cheap labour; others have short-term projects that need completing, and welcome the opportunity of a finely honed management brain.Nonetheless, when an internship works well, it can be a positive experience on both sides. “There are some very thoughtful companies out there,” says Wilbur. Such companies help the students to develop and take their role seriously, she says, and at the end of the internship, even if the two go their separate ways, they frequently maintain contact.For Maria Karaivanova, a Harvard MBA who recently completed her internship in South Africa with Lapdesk, an initiative to provide school children with plastic lap desks, the experience was life changing.It was, she says, a risk-free option to do something new and different. “I hoped to have my imagination stretched, my assumptions challenged and my newly minted MBA skills employed to the fullest, and it all happened.”"
279;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-01-12T20:45:04Z;Bermudan group finds Ireland has XL factor;;XL Capital, the Bermudan insurance and reinsurance group, has become the latest in the industry to announce plans to move its legal domicile to Ireland, which is finding favour both as growing insurance market and as a stable, low-tax home.Mike McGavick, chief executive, acknowledged the risk of a clampdown on tax havens by US lawmakers, but said that there was more to the proposed move of its legal domicile away from the Cayman Islands, where it is registered in spite of its Bermudan base.“The real focus for us is not on the negatives, but on the broad positives of working in Ireland,” Mr McGavick said. “We have had significant operations in Dublin for some time and have grown those in recent years.”Willis, the world’s third-biggest insurance broker, announced in September that it planned to move its headquarters from Bermuda to Ireland, while Aviva more recently followed the example of Zurich Financial Services by saying it would establish its European headquarters in Dublin.Beazley, the Lloyd’s of London insurer, moved from London to Dublin for tax reasons, while a stream of other companies including Accenture, the consulting group, have announced moves away from Bermuda since Barack Obama became US President and adopted a tough line on tax havens.Beyond any potential crackdown on tax havens, there are several pieces of US legislation in the pipeline that could affect adversely companies based in countries that do not have tax treaties with the US, according to experts.Ireland has been establishing itself as an important market for international commercial insurance – although it is a long way from challenging the dominance of London, New York and Bermuda.The Irish market saw gross premium volumes of €26.2bn in 2008, up significantly from the €18bn recorded in 2007, according to the most recent survey of annual activity from the Dublin International Insurance & Management Association.XL’s move is unlikely to give any boost to the local economy because the group already has a significant presence in Ireland.The main difference will be that the XL board will hold its main meetings in Dublin instead of in Bermuda.
280;ACN;Accenture Plc;2010-01-10T19:05:44Z;Insurers rush to strike Asian deals;;Prudential’s move to expand its footprint in Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand will bolster expectations that 2010 will be a defining year for the life assurance sector across Asia.The sector is experiencing unprecedented activity as local and foreign groups jostle to raise capital or strike deals to capture a larger slice of the world’s fastest-growing markets for life assurance. “A number of foreign insurers are considering expanding their existing operations in Asia or entering new markets,” says Sandra Khor, head of insurance, Greater China, for Accenture, the consultancy.UK-based Prudential already books a third of its global sales in Asia – the largest single region – and last week inked an agreement with Singapore’s United Overseas Bank to boost its presence there and in its two neighbours.As part of the deal, UOB will sell Prudential products through its branch networks in the three countries for at least 12 years and also divest its Singaporean life assurance unit to the UK group for $307m.Dealmakers say this agreement highlights how some regional activity is being driven by consolidation opportunities, as smaller groups withdraw from non-core markets and sell to larger rivals. Wee Ee Cheong, UOB chief executive, says while UOB Life has achieved good progress over the past two decades it remained “a relatively small player in a highly competitive industry”.Elsewhere, the pace of activity has increased in recent months as insurance groups become excited about growth forecasts. According to a McKinsey study last year, Asia is expected to generate up to 40 per cent of the growth in the global life assurance industry over the next five years – and foreign insurers are well placed to benefit.The biggest event in the sector this year is expected to be the Hong Kong stock market listing of American International Assurance, the regional unit of AIG, the troubled US insurer.AIA boasts 20m policyholders across 13 countries and delivers annual operating profit of about $2bn and a listing could help AIG repay at least $10bn to the US government.South Korea is also preparing to list its leading life assurers, following last October’s initial public offering of Tong Yang Life. Samsung Life, Korea Life and Mirae Asset Life each aim to list this year.Sydney-listed Axa Asia-Pacific is subject to a $12bn takeover battle between two Australian financial groups. They want to acquire its local assets but sell the high-growth businesses back to Paris-based Axa, its French parent.In Taiwan, a Hong Kong-based consortium is awaiting regulatory approval for its $2.15bn proposed buy-out of Nan Shan, one of the island’s top insurers, which is owned by AIG. If successful, it will be its largest financial sector deal involving a foreign acquirer.McKinsey estimates China and India will account for about 70 per cent of regional growth in life assurance premium income. Penetration rates are 4 per cent in India and 2 per cent in China, where McKinsey estimates compound annual growth rates will exceed 15 per cent for the next five years.Tough restrictions mean foreign life assurers cannot operate independently in China and India, forcing western groups to form joint ventures with local partners.Analysts say foreign groups need to be mindful of the capital requirements involved in expanding while home regulators are paying close attention to financial strength. There is also danger that foreign groups could overpay in their desperation to expand.
281;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-12-31T18:55:24Z;AT&T breaks ties with Tiger Woods;;AT&T has dropped its sponsorship of Tiger Woods following weeks of allegations of marital infidelity by the golf star.The US telecommunications group is the latest corporate sponsor to sever ties with the golfer, and joins Accenture, the global consultancy.Other companies have sought to distance themselves from the world’s wealthiest athlete.“We are ending our sponsorship agreement with Tiger Woods and wish him well in the future,” AT&T said on Thursday.AT&T’s logo adorns Mr Woods’s golf bag, but he does not appear in its advertisements. AT&T will continue to sponsor a PGA golf tournament this year.Procter & Gamble is still a sponsor, but has scaled back Gillette advertisements featuring Mr Woods. Tag Heuer, the Swiss watchmaker, is reviewing its endorsement deal with the golfer.Nike, the world’s largest sports shoe and clothing business, has remained supportive in recent weeks.Mr Woods’s spate of bad publicity began in late November after a minor car accident outside his home, which exposed a slate of allegations. Shortly afterwards, he said he would take “indefinite” leave from professional golf.Since the negative publicity began, sponsors have pulled advertisements featuring Mr Woods.His departure from golf has cost up to $12bn in stock market value for his nine largest sponsors, according to two economics professors at the University of California. That estimate does not include Mr Woods’s own earnings.Their study tracked eight publicly listed sponsors, which also include Electronic Arts, for 13 trading days from November 27, the date of the car crash, to December 17, a week after Mr Woods announced that he was leaving the sport.Mark Parker, Nike chief executive, said last month the company would “continue to support Tiger and his family as we look forward to his return”, in spite of the fact that he had “chosen to step away from the game” indefinitely.Nike’s golf business, with about $650m in annual sales, has a multimillion-dollar endorsement relationship with Mr Woods, which has included developing a golf shoe, clubs and other equipment.Omar Saad, analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a research note last month Mr Woods’s problems could lead Nike and other groups to reassess the effectiveness of celebrity relationships.
282;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-12-29T18:24:42Z;India mines riches as west’s back office;;"Not far from a flyover-in-the-making and surrounded by heavily congested traffic in Bangalore is a tiny slice of the US.The Infosys Technologies campus, in the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka, is almost folkloric in India. By appearance it is more university than workplace. Its youthful employees munch on Subway sandwiches, play volleyball and amble to their workstations among glassy buildings.Visitors to this marvel of modern India glide along its lanes on white golf carts. The hurly burly of auto rickshaws and milling millions is left outside.The private sector business park is one of the most potent symbols of the transformative power of a single sector of Asia’s third largest economy: information technology outsourcing. Proficiency in the English language, technical skills and low cost helped Indian companies over the past decade plug into the global economy and earn a reputation as the “world’s back office”. Big western companies, particularly in the US, turned to Indian service providers – such as Infosys, Wipro, Genpact and Tata Consultancy Services – to support IT systems, supply back office business processing and staff call centres.The “new economy” prospered on little more than some computers, telephone lines and entrepreneurial spirit in the 1990s. But today India has about 50 per cent of the global market for offshore IT and business services. US companies such as IBM, Dell, Accenture and JPMorgan now employ thousands of professionals in India.India’s outsourcing revenues are close to $60bn a year. In 1998 they were just $4bn. The sector employs about 1.6m people, many of them English-speaking graduates. With India expected to maintain its edge, these numbers are forecast to double over the next five years.The appeal of Indian outsourcing to big global corporations also represented a significant shift of economic power from the US to India. Outsourcing’s stellar performance helped the Indian economy to break with decades of 4 per cent growth and reach 9 per cent, a feat that has allowed it to be identified, along with China, as a “pole of growth”. It also put Indian executives in the same boardroom as their US and European counterparts, and launched a wave of young people to study and work on the US west coast.Ilan Oshri, an associate fellow at Warwick Business School and the London School of Economics, says Indian outsourcing companies are now woven into the fabric of western business in spite of the threat of protectionism from the global economic downturn.He says many companies now turn to outsourcing not simply for its low cost but because of the quality of service. Indian outsourcing companies have gained a formidable reputation, and a global footprint, that will keep them at the forefront of the industry, he says.India’s abundant human capital is moving up the value chain. Promising new areas include research and development capabilities in biotech and pharmaceuticals, computer software and electronics, and the auto and aerospace industries.Business processing is set to overtake IT outsourcing in terms of revenue as Indian vendors diversify into services such as human resources, payroll management and legal services. Moreover, leading Indian outsourcing companies are themselves opening operations in other countries, such as China, the Philippines and the US.Som Mittal, president of Nasscom, India’s outsourcing industry association, predicts a return to double-digit growth for the industry next year, after a dip this year, and sees no trend of US companies pulling back outsourcing activities.A recent report written by Mr Oshri, however, highlights some of the shortcomings of what remains a young business model whose benefits are not always clearly understood. It said that 40 per cent of European clients surveyed had cut outsourcing over the past year; most of these said value for money from the services they were receiving was unclear. One astonishing finding was that many chief financial officers did not measure the benefit of outsourcing to their businesses beyond a one-off cost saving.With a decade of success and considerable fortunes behind them, the founding generation of India’s outsourcing companies has already begun to hang up its keyboards. Earlier this year Nandan Nilekani, the former chairman of Infosys, quit his office on the Bangalore campus to take up public office with the rank of cabinet minister. Having scaled the heights of Indian business as a first generation entrepreneur, without the more usual foot-up from a powerful family, he now hopes to bring identity cards to 1.2bn people.The extraordinary growth he witnessed in the outsourcing sector has made him a champion of India’s possibilities, particularly in alignment with the west.“Fifteen years ago the chairman of a leading bank, the Union Bank of India, criticised my efforts to promote the benefits of bank computerisation in the industry,” recalls Mr Nilekani. “Recently, however, his successor called me up and told me with pride that they were running the entire bank on one central computer system.”He foresees Indian business laying claim to a rather larger slice of the US in the coming years, in attitude and social mobility as much as business revenues.“This Indian industry has carved out a route to the American dream for our workers,” he says."
283;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-12-18T19:59:21Z;Halo insurance;;Some people fall in with a bad crowd. Some companies, too. Never fear: DeWitt Stern, a US insurance broker, is launching a product that will allow corporations to guard themselves against the risk that the idols that they pay to appear in their advertisements will prove to have clay feet – or, perhaps more likely, wandering hands and eyes.Accenture recently went through this problem with Tiger Woods: it dropped the golfer from its advertising following his front-page swan-dive from grace. Hennes and Mauritz ditched Kate Moss, the British model, in 2005 after she was at the centre of drug allegations. There are, however, real problems with such policies.DeWitt Stern says it will insist on screening celebrities that it covers: subjects will need to fill in a questionnaire. It may, however, be difficult to get honest answers to inquiries such as “Are you, or have you ever been, a philanderer?” or “Do you intend to smoke crack in the next 12 months?”.If that were not obstacle enough, setting conditions for policies will also be complex. Some stars trade off their rebellious image and might need to be banned from being good to their mothers or accepting Jesus as their personal saviour. (Some celebrities’ grey reputations might also be improved by the colour that a spot of scandal would bring them.)One also assumes that such a policy would only meet major pay-outs. Otherwise, the insurers would be constantly sending out cheques every time a paid-for celebrity was the butt of a joke in a magazine, or on TV. (“Dear Sir, Jay Leno implied that your associate is a scumbag. Please accept $11 in compensation.”)Policy-writers would also need to be wary of fraud: stars might be tempted to steal from their insurance companies. They might try to trigger pay-outs by indulging in drunken fights and drug-fuelled frenzies of infidelity. Reputation insurance could unleash the mother of all moral hazards.
284;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-12-18T01:43:54Z;Nike reaffirms its support for Tiger Woods;;Nike, the world’s largest sports shoe and clothing business, on Thursday pledged to continue using marketing relationships with leading athletes to build its brands, as it restated its support for Tiger Woods, the troubled golf superstar.Mark Parker, chief executive, said Nike would “continue to support Tiger and his family as we look forward to his return”, in spite of the fact that he had “ chosen to step away from the game” indefinitely.Nike’s golf business, with about $650m in annual sales, has a multimillion dollar endorsement relationship with Mr Woods, which has included developing a golf shoe, clubs and other equipment.Since being involved in a car accident this month outside his home, Mr Woods has publicly acknowledged marital infidelity and announced he was taking a break from professional golf. He has subsequently seen the ending of his endorsement deal with Accenture, the global consultancy, while P&G’s Gillette brand said it was temporarily scaling back its relationship with him.Omar Saad, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a research note this week that Tiger Woods’ problems could lead to Nike and other companies rethinking the effectiveness of celebrity relationships.“We expect the Tiger media fallout to serve as a catalyst for them both to realise that they are systematically overpaying for athlete and team sponsorships, especially given the growing risks involved,” he wrote of Nike and and its rival Adidas.But Mr Parker said that Nike’s relationships with star athletes “are really critical to developing the insights [that] fuel the product innovation that really distinguishes us in the market place and ultimately the overall business performance of the company”.“This is a strategy that works,” he said, adding that the company continued to assess the economics of sponsorship. “The reality is we participate in an open market …ultimately we make those decisions based on the opportunity we believe we have to drive the strength of the brand, the business and …shareholder value.”Six years ago, Nike maintained its relationship with Kobe Bryant, the US basketball star, when he was the subject of a police investigation into allegations of illegal behaviour that were subsequently dropped.Nike on Thursday reported its second-quarter revenues fell 4 per cent to $4.4bn, while its earnings also fell 4 per cent to $375m, or 76 cents per diluted share, as global demand for its shoes and clothing remained weak. But it reported a 4 per cent increase against the same period last year in future orders for delivery in the coming five months, to $7bn. In the US, its largest market, future orders were down 4 per cent.
285;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Insurers to launch reputational risk product;;Insurers are planning to introduce a new product to help companies limit the financial fall-out when their brands or high-profile spokesmen such as Tiger Woods suffer reputational damage.DeWitt Stern, a 110-year-old US insurance broker, has already received expressions of interest from London underwriters about backing a reputational risk product it aims to launch early in 2010.Scott Brady, Dewitt Stern managing director, told the Financial Times that the product could develop into something akin to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, designed to protect boards from shareholder lawsuits. Over 30 years, “D&O” cover has grown into a multi-billion dollar market, he said.DeWitt Stern has been working on the product for six months. But the business turmoil caused by Mr Woods’ admission of infidelity has starkly highlighted companies’ vulnerability if the reputations of their brands or pitchmen are struck by scandal.Accenture, the consultancy, dropped the golfer from its advertising this weekend as other sponsors began to distance themselves from the sportsman. Accenture said it had seen no material impact on its business, however.Many consultants predicted in 2005 that brands would be wary of using celebrities to endorse their products after Hennes & Mauritz and others dropped Kate Moss from their advertising following drug allegations.DeWitt Stern would insist on individuals it covers undertaking a pre-screening process, including a detailed questionnaire about their lifestyle, and would attempt to limit the losses from any reputational damage with a crisis communications strategy. Companies’ demand for background investigations when hiring new executives or assessing business partners have already created a lucrative business for security groups such as Kroll.Amy Lashinsky, managing director of Alaco, a London business intelligence consultancy, said many “responsible” companies already used due diligence to manage reputational risks. “Crises are not cheap. A reputational event could cost you billions of dollars,” said Robbie Vorhaus, a crisis communications executive working with DeWitt Stern.Figures from TNS Media Intelligence this week estimated that Accenture was Mr Woods’ biggest backer, using him in 83 per cent of its $50m advertising spending last year, while he appeared in 27 per cent of Tag Heuer’s marketing and 4 per cent of Nike’s.They also underscored the threat to the $600m spent by marketers on PGA golf broadcasts in the US each year, noting that for matches in which Mr Woods played advertisers paid a 53 per cent premium last year over those from which he was absent.According to Willis, one of the world’s biggest insurance brokers, there is already cover available for reputational risks as part of some D&O policies. It is often referred to as “spin-doctor cover” because it helps pay for the publicists and brand consultants needed to help manage hits to reputation.Additional reporting by Paul J. Davies
286;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
287;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-12-14T22:59:43Z;Tag Heuer to rethink Woods sponsorship;;"Tiger Woods on Monday night looked in danger of losing another sponsor when Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer rowed back from declaring its support for the troubled golfer and said it would review its commercial relationship.Mr Woods, who is taking an indefinite break from golf to sort out his private life, lost the backing of Accenture at the weekend, which said it was terminating its six-year sponsorship.AT&T has said it was evaluating its relationship and Gillette is holding back its marketing of Mr Woods in support of his need for privacy.Tag Heuer, which has been associated with Mr Woods for seven years,
on Monday appeared ready to throw its weight behind the golfer when a spokeswoman told reporters that the company respected what he had achieved in golf and that his personal life was “not our business”.However, this position had shifted by the end of the day. Tag Heuer issued a statement saying: “We respect the privacy of Tiger Woods and his family. In light of recent news, including that Tiger Woods has decided to take an indefinite leave from golf, over the coming weeks we will assess our options with Tiger Woods and IMG [Woods’ agent] regarding our long-term relationship.’’Mr Woods received some respite on Monday when Nike, one of his biggest sponsors, appeared to brush off the allegations of extra-marital affairs that have damaged the golfer’s image. The allegations led to Mr Woods admitting publicly to infidelity.Phil Knight, chairman and co-founder of Nike, said in a sports magazine interview that there was always a risk when companies backed athletes. He told US-based Sports Business Journal that: “Obviously, [Woods] was one we checked out and he came out clean, and I think he’s been really great. When his career is over, you’ll look back on these indiscretions as a minor blip, but the media is making a big deal out of it right now.”The interview was conducted prior to Mr Woods’ announcing a break from the game. Nike said on Friday that Mr Woods and his family had its full support.The golfer has about a dozen big sponsors, including EA Sports and Gatorade. Some estimates puts his overall earnings at about $1bn. Mr Woods has not appeared in public since revelations of his private life surfaced after he crashed his car outside his Florida home more than two weeks ago."
288;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Accenture axes Woods deal;;Accenture, the consulting business, axed its six-year sponsorship deal with Tiger Woods in the biggest financial blow so far from the crisis in the golfer’s personal life.The end to a campaign, featuring the slogan “Go on, be a Tiger”, followed news on Saturday that Gillette, the Procter & Gamble shaving brand, would limit the golfer’s role in its marketing programmes to help protect his privacy.Mr Woods’s admission of infidelity, preceded by weeks of media speculation, has tarnished his clean-cut image.AT&T, the US telecommunications company, offered its support to Mr Woods over the weekend but said it was reviewing its partnership.Accenture said on Sunday that Mr Woods’s sporting achievements had been “a powerful metaphor for business success. However, given the circumstances of the last two weeks, after careful consideration and analysis, the company has determined that he is no longer the right representative for its advertising.”Other sponsors may hold off from making a decision “and hope that he golfs his way out of the situation”, said Robbie Vorhaus, a US consultant specialising in crisis communications.His decision to take an “indefinite” leave from professional golf for the sake of his family has also left sponsors of the sport concerned that the player’s absence could damage television ratings.The PGA Tour, which operates the main professional golf tours in the US, claims there is evidence that tournaments in which Mr Woods has not appeared have enjoyed some of the best TV audiences of the season.But US golf observers said there was plenty of evidence of TV ratings suffering last year when Mr Woods was largely absent due to a knee injury.Sponsors and tournament organisers have enjoyed TV ratings boosts when Mr Woods plays.Mr Woods, the greatest golfer of his generation and the world’s most recognised sportsman, is worth an estimated $1bn thanks in part to his endorsement deals.He is far from the first celebrity to fall from grace. Brands such as H&M distanced themselves from Kate Moss after tabloid newspapers published pictures that appeared to show the British model using cocaine, but she rebounded to front campaigns for Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Burberry within a year.Mr Woods has stayed away from the public eye since a minor car accident outside his Florida home in November, which set off a spate of claims from women that they had had affairs with the golfer.
289;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-12-12T16:57:47Z;Woods to take ‘indefinite’ leave from golf;;Tiger Woods is to take an “indefinite” leave from golf following a week of damaging personal revelations that have tarnished the reputation of the sport’s greatest star.Woods has not made any public appearances since having a minor car accident outside his Florida home at the end of November. However, the incident has triggered a spate of revelations from several women who have alleged affairs with the golfer.Woods is the greatest golfer of his generation and is worth an estimated $1bn thanks to a string of lucrative endorsement deals with companies including Nike, Accenture, AT&T and Gillette.One of Tiger Woods’ major commercial sponsors, Gillette, said on Saturday it would limit the golfer’s role in its marketing programs to help protect his privacy amid the sex scandal surrounding him.“As Tiger takes a break from the public eye, we will support his desire for privacy by limiting his role in our marketing programs,” Gillette said in a statement.Television commercials featuring Woods have been notably absent from the airwaves since the scandal broke although none of his sponsors have yet severed their relationship with the golfer.Woods said in a statement on his website that he was “deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people, most of all my wife and children”.“After much soul searching, I have decided to take an indefinite break from professional golf. I need to focus my attention on being a better husband, father, and person.”

The two of us share many commonalities: we are both golfers, although my swing’s got a bit rusty these past two years!! We are both perfectionists who have learnt to overcome our innate impatience. In life, we both expect to birdie every hole.

291;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-12-09T19:10:42Z;Cracking the case;;Last week I was lucky enough to attend a lunch with the Asian senior leadership team from Accenture. Our school has started taking a more serious approach to a consulting stream and we – or at least those of us interested in pursuing this stream – had a series of talks and training from the Kellogg alumni career services director.The first of the lectures was entitled ‘Cracking the case: How to succeed in consulting interviews’ and we were given tips on what to look for and how to deal with such interviews.Most consultancy firms interview prospective employees with a series of cases and Matt, the Kellogg career director, was able to break these down into bite size pieces for us. He was an exceptional teacher and had us all leaving the room thinking we could DEFINITELY solve whatever case they put our way.Matt also walked us through an interview case and managed an ‘elevator pitch’ session for MBA’s, alumni and some EMBA students. I realise more than ever how necessary these ‘soft skills’ are to people who don’t have them or have never had to acquire them.There is a very subtle difference in an individual’s approach to ‘the room’ depending on their past roles or background. Seeing this approach in action varies from impressive to a car crash waiting to happen. Both outcomes are fun to watch and assess.Part of the week’s activities included a sharing session with some of the Accenture leadership team who gave us a very honest and candid talk. We were six tables, with one or two Accenture representatives at each table receiving a grilling from their table companions, us.They were refreshingly honest and gave us a very positive outlook. Many students who have come from overseas (which is most of us) want to stay and work in China and Hong Kong. However, it appears the probability of us actually GETTING a job decreases with every talk and meeting we have.The main reason for this is our poor, or non-existent, Mandarin skills. Some of us have tried, without success, to acquire these language skills but it is almost impossible to get to a high level while carrying the work load that we currently have to bear.It turns out that staying in our home countries and being placed here would have been an easier ticket to getting a role in any corporation than trying to apply for a position from here. A bitter pill to swallow, but most of us are more determined than ever to make sure we manage to secure roles through whatever channel we can find.
292;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:10:52+0000;Woods an asset even with ‘transgressions’;;Accenture’s latest advertising campaign has a picture of Tiger Woods standing on the edge of a stream, club in hand, looking at his ball perched precariously on a rock. “It’s what you do next that counts,” reads the global management consultancy’s strapline.Sponsors of the world’s number one golfer have been asking that question every day since last Friday morning when he drove his Cadillac sports utility vehicle into a tree and a fire hydrant outside his Florida home.The media firestorm that followed the incident, resulting in Mr Woods’ statement on Wednesday apologising to his family for what he called “transgressions” in his private life, is hardly a narrative sponsors had in mind in return for investing about $100m a year in the golf superstar.“The sponsors will definitely be telling him and his people, ‘you have to stop this now, you have to get up front, you have to become pro-active in how you deal with this,’” says Lesa Ukman, founder and chairman of IEG the Chicago-based sponsorship consultancy, who estimates Woods’ total earnings at about $750m.But if there is short-term anxiety among Woods’ commercial backers, publicly at least they were not letting on. One by one, Nike, EA Sports, Gillette, NetJets and Gatorade have put their arm round Mr Woods and declared that their relationship continues.Such wholehearted support comes as little surprise to the sponsorship industry. One reason is that, while Mr Woods and his advisers have built his image around many values, such as his diversity, his connection with young people, his appeal to C-level executives and his well-spoken demeanour, Christian morality is not one of them.“It’s not like it’s a crisis of hypocrisy,” says Ms Ukman. Sponsors may have so-called “morality” clauses tied up in their contracts, allowing them to withdraw if the client’s moral behaviour materially damages their brand reputation, but Ms Ukman does not envisage any of Woods’ sponsors exercising them.David Letterman, the talk show host, has kept his reputation largely intact following his confession in October to affairs with his staff. So too Michael Phelps, eight-times gold medallist at the Beijing Olympics, who admitted to “bad judgment” after being photographed smoking dope .Sponsors will also be mindful of research showing some companies’ brand values suffering after walking away from sportsmen and teams whose performace has declined, while the brands of others being enhanced for sticking with clients in the face of adversity.For Mr Woods’ myriad sponsors, there is the added calculation that he remains at the top of his game, and as long as that continues their returns on investment should continue to be healthy. The industry benchmark for licensing sponsors is about $4 returned for every $1 of investment. For other sponsors, it is about $2.50 to $1.The US PGA Tour, where Woods plies his trade, readily acknowledges the importance of Woods to the game. Ty Votaw, an executive vice-president of the tour, says his commercial value is immense, particularly in his ability to bring the casual sports fan to golf.“There is no question that at events that Tiger plays, interest leves in terms of audience, TV ratings and media coverage spike.“Golf has certainly benefited by the fact that the most recognised athlete in the world plays this sport. You would expect that commercial interest will have increased because of that.”Mr Woods is missing from the greens, having pulled out of this week’s Chevron World Challenge in California, a tournament he hosts. Sponsors will hope that by the time he returns, he will have safely extracted himself from this fiendishly tricky position.
293;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-12-02T13:47:16Z;Study shows businesses rely on technology investment to restore strength after recession;;Nearly three-quarters of business and IT executives at large corporations believe the economic crisis has brought a greater acknowledgement from business unit managers of just how important IT is in supporting and developing the business.According to a recent Accenture survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 72 per cent of business and IT executives at major corporations believe the economic crisis has actually brought a greater acknowledgement from business unit managers of just how important IT is in supporting and developing the business.Furthermore, most organisations now view IT as critical to their rescue operations and very survival – believing technology to be a fundamental tool to drive through market change and disruption. The current perception, contrary to a year ago when many IT projects found themselves on the cutting block, is that IT allows a company to run at lower cost and with greater agility. As a result, IT and business executives actually anticipate an increased investment in technology over the next year – either selectively (according to 47 per cent of those surveyed) or across the board (10 per cent) – with few planning to further cut costs significantly.Strong control of IT project costs, however, remains a primary concern. A clear signal from the survey is that in order to achieve sustainable cost reduction an organisation must tackle the underlying, ongoing cost of IT and not just cut back on IT projects. In one sense, it is easy to discontinue projects. Organisations want to accelerate IT, and achieve more agile, cost effective business change.Which types of technology projects are most likely to receive significant new funding over the next year? According to the survey, IT and business executives list server virtualisation or consolidation as the #1 investment priority, followed closely by customer relationships and service, E-business (e.g. online selling and supplier portals), finance/performance management, and technical innovation such as Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) as prime candidates.In short, there seems to be a growing understanding of IT as not merely a cost item, but rather as an enabler for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire business operation. Companies at the same time will demand a more disciplined and accelerated approach, including casting a closer eye on the returns IT delivers. We’ve seen this with our clients, and within Accenture itself.To allow its executives to react to business and market changes more quickly, one of Switzerland’s largest insurers built a robust data warehouse and a superior data management capability, and created a dedicated business intelligence unit. This improved data quality and visibility, plus access to new analytical tools, enabled the insurer to reduce its claims cost by more than $10m annually.Similarly, Accenture’s investment in telepresence technology and workplace collaboration tools enables our people to work more effectively across geographic boundaries while reducing carbon footprint and travel costs. Yes, it meant spending money to save money, but the investment has already helped drive significant and positive changes across our business, which will only increase over time.In line with this, the study shows that performance metrics have grown in importance – accompanied by the need for risks to be defined more clearly. For example, over three quarters of the large firms globally now use either financial, productivity or progress metrics to measure the performance and benefits of their technology investments. This includes placing demands for greater efficiencies from system servers and software.What we’ve seen as a result of all this is a stronger results focus on the part of our clients. Any project proposal will receive strong scrutiny. Projects will be defined with a greater clarity of vision and IT managers are more vigilant in getting executive sponsorship from the beginning to increase the probability of success of their projects. Organisations are shifting their emphasis from thinking “what can I do this week” to taking a more long term and strategic approach. IT executives surveyed cite ensuring that project requirements are well-defined, tied to business goals and remain stable as the most important measures firms can take to reduce implementation costs.The pressure to invest smartly, drive for agility, and manage costs proactively is not a “for the moment” phenomenon in dealing with IT during financial crises, but something that will continue even once businesses return to normal. As this study suggests, organisations have been left with the broader realisation that technology can dramatically deliver performance improvement and cost reduction at any time, even in today’s market conditions.About the StudyTo gauge how companies’ attitudes toward technology investment in different parts of the business have changed in response to the global financial and economic crisis and to explore how investment may evolve over the next 12 months, the Economist Intelligence Unit surveyed 557 senior executives from a wide range of industries in August and September 2009. Countries included in the survey sample include: US, UK and Ireland, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. The survey sample was senior, with 55% of respondents being C-level executives such as CIOs, CFOs and CEOs. Two-thirds of the respondents hold an IT function, with the remainder executing other functional roles. All are knowledgeable about the technology investments being made in their part of the organization or the business overall. The companies surveyed cover a wide cross-section of industries. Fully 62% of them have annual global revenue of more than US$500 million.

295;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-11-26T18:04:50Z;Monitoring: Lighting up the road ahead;;"Running a business without business intelligence (BI) is often likened to flying an aeroplane without instruments – you can get away with it in clear skies and with a following wind. But matters can take a turn for the worse if you hit clouds, or turbulence.Few businesses, of course, risk flying blind. The question is whether the instruments they have give them the full picture of what lies ahead. A good pilot can fly with instruments and a map, but most of us are much more comfortable in a craft equipped with radar and GPS.In a business, monitoring data as they move through the organisation provides the equivalent of the aircraft’s GPS co-ordinates, altitude and air speed. Advanced analytics takes on the role of the radar, pointing out what lies ahead.But creating accurate real-time pictures of where a business is, let alone predicting where it is going, is stretching the capabilities of conventional BI, and forcing vendors as well as data analysts to look at emerging technologies in order to sift through ever-larger quantities of information.In some fields, businesses are turning to stream computing, where powerful machines analyse data in real time as they move through a system, looking for trigger points or anomalies.A stream computing system developed by IBM, known as InfoSphere, is already being used to analyse “space weather”, a phenomenon that creates interference with radio communications.Closer to earth, brokerage TD Securities is using stream computing as the basis for an options trading system it believes is the world’s fastest.In the area of advanced analytics, significant work has already been done by governments in predicting what could happen in the future, for example in the field of counter-terrorism.And companies are looking beyond relatively simple tools, such as regression analysis, to identify complex patterns in data and make increasingly accurate predictions of customer demand, the movement of market prices, or even traffic patterns.Retailers are using trend spotting software to enable them to predict what will be in fashion next season, and the technology is even being used by Hollywood studios and their financial backers to predict the next blockbuster.These systems use pattern analysis, often mining non-conventional sources such as consumer sentiment or weather predictions, to provide forecasts and advice.Attractive though these projects are, however, there are downsides.The greatest is the sheer cost of building systems that can provide real-time information to managers. Another is the human ability to respond to real-time signals.There is little point in spending what can easily be $1bn, or more, on a BI system if the organisation it serves is not agile enough to act on the insights provided.Some experts go as far as to say that real-time systems only have a role to play in decisions that can be made entirely without human intervention.“There is a case you can make, for automated decision-making, where real-time [analysis] is necessary,” says Jeanne Harris, a BI specialist at Accenture’s Institute for High Performance Business.“A tsunami warning system, or a credit card fraud detection system, needs to work in real time. But the number of cases, compared with these that work in ‘nearly real time’, is small.”Information management professionals draw a distinction between systems that genuinely need to work in real time, and those where the information is merely timely, or has to be delivered at the “right” time.Often, the immediacy and value of information changes through the business process, creating a further challenge when it comes to developing advanced, analytical or prediction systems. Information need not be real-time to be timely.Areas where the value of information changes over time include perishable goods and commodities, such as airline seats or hotel beds, as well as the information that is used to synchronise other business processes, such as in a delivery company, or when a retailer places a stock order.An airline looking to fill its cabins will need increasingly timely and accurate information as the number of seats fills up, in order not to overbook and face paying compensation to passengers.A distribution company will need to deliver goods to a supermarket’s hub or to a factory within a narrow time window, or face financial penalties. But if it takes two days to deliver an item by truck, information needs to be at its most accurate as the delivery window approaches.In a similar way, a retail store manager ordering goods made in Asia might need to do so six weeks before they are required, to avoid running out of stock.Placing the order too early means tying up cash and valuable stock room space. Whereas, placing the order even a few hours late risks missing the replenishment window.“Information and the time taken to make a decision can be perishable,” says Bill Hostmann, a research vice-president at Gartner.“There are examples where it does pay off: Continental Airlines is an example of a company that has to make real time decisions, for example if a plane is forced to divert. They spend millions but it kept them in business,” says Mr Hostmann.At Continental, better business intelligence made for better communications with passengers affected by delays and diversions, and this helped the company retain the loyalty of its highest-spending passengers, the frequent business travellers.But at the same time, Mr Hostmann concedes that management teams can quickly become addicted to faster information flows. “The latency [the time delay when data are sent from place to place] is an important discussion.“But if information is monthly, they want it weekly or daily; if it is daily, they want it hourly,” he says.As organisations act to reduce latency, and to push that through their monitoring systems so that managers can act on it, costs usually increase.This is a real barrier to moving to advanced analytics, when IT budgets are constrained, and businesses are no longer willing to spend multi-million dollar sums on enterprise-wide IT projects that take five or more years to deliver.There are exceptions: according to Jeff Jonas, chief scientist at IBM’s Entity Analytics business, some of the latest analysis systems become not only more accurate, but faster, as they process more data.“The problem of trying to apply an algorithm to an individual transaction is like trying to squeeze knowledge out of a pixel. So we allow organisations to weave together different pieces of data from across the enterprise.”Again, the idea is not so much to provide real-time data, but to remove latency or delays that can lead to less than optimal decision making.However, the complexity and cost of such systems has tended to limit their deployment to specific circumstances where the cost is justified, such as complex financial trades, security, or fraud detection.Some of the more advanced features, such as faster processing and better scenario planning, are becoming part of mainstream BI. But by no means all emerging monitoring technologies will do so, not least because businesses will only benefit from them if they can act on the information.“You don’t want to invest in real-time information infrastructure if you have a batch decision-making process,” warns Gartner’s Bill Hostmann.“If you can’t pull the levers, and can’t respond in real time, don’t make the investment.”"
296;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-11-26T18:04:50Z;Supply chain: IT aims to overcome the blind spots;;A lack of visibility into systems data is the number one challenge facing supply chain professionals today. That’s the main finding from a 2009 IBM survey of 400 supply chain executives worldwide.More than two-thirds (70 per cent) reported that making sense of “overwhelming and fragmented data” about supply chain performance is costly, difficult and too time-consuming.According to Sanjeev Nagrath, global supply chain management leader for IBM’s global business services arm, that creates “blind spots” at many companies, causing them to fall behind on customer orders, with potentially damaging consequences.Business intelligence (BI) technology provides an answer to this lack of visibility, he suggests, by collecting critical information about supply chain performance from disparate systems, consolidating it and presenting it to supply chain managers in the form of meaningful reports and metrics.But in IBM’s survey, only 16 per cent of respondents said their organisations were effective at integrating data across the supply chain in this way. “Cost and resource issues are largely to blame,” says Mr Nagrath.It is only at companies where the supply chain operation is seen as a critical boardroom issue with direct links to financial results – rather than a backroom operation – that implementing BI to improve it is seen as a priority.Those that do embark on such projects often find that applying BI to supply chain data is inherently more complex than applying it to data in other departments, such as the finance office, according to Kevin O’Marah, an analyst with AMR Research.“To date, BI has been more widely taken up in parts of the business where information is more readily available and often held in a departmental database. In supply chain operations, the data you need may not be in the system at all or be held in numerous disparate systems, both internal and those of your key supply chain partners, such as suppliers or freight companies,” he says.“That makes it very difficult to answer key questions: Where is a specific shipment? When did it leave the warehouse? Is the order complete?”A vital step before BI tools are chosen, is discussions between employees from around the company – not just supply chain operations – on what data are required.“True supply chain visibility needs to be a cross-departmental initiative if it is to get the significantly better results that are achievable,” says Mathieu Clerkx, an executive advisor to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and a former senior vice-president specialising in supply chain operations at electronics giant Philips and microprocessor company STMicroelectronics.He has worked with TCS to offer its clients in markets such as retail a hosted analytics platform that includes information about procurement and financial spending, supplier performance, inbound and outbound logistics, inventory planning, manufacturing and order fulfilment.Increasingly, he says, clients are using this kind of platform not only to assess current performance but also using for its simulation capabilities to model “what-if” scenarios that demonstrate the likely impact of a disruption to the chain.Another approach is to use one of the growing number of BI tools offered on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) basis. This is what Bill Coyne, director of purchasing and logistics at Welch’s, the US food manufacturer, has done.The company, which processes approximately 50,000 customer orders a year for its grape-based juice and jelly products, had run up against what Mr Coyne saw as shortcomings in the transportation and logistics modules of the company’s Oracle enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and difficulties in integrating its bespoke freight pay system that it uses to track transportation costs.Mr Coyne had worked before on supply chain problems with Bill Copacino, formerly group chief executive for global business consulting at Accenture, where he specialised in both BI and supply chain management.When he heard that Mr Copacino had been appointed chief executive of Oco, a small but fast-growing BI-as-a-service company, he was quick to make contact. Together, teams from Oco and Welch’s built a hosted data warehouse that draws data from several key back-office systems.“We take every order, every bill of lading or shipment, and every freight bill that’s paid, and in the middle of the night, we transmit that electronically over to Oco, where it’s used to populate our mini data warehouse,” he says.This, he says, has enabled Welch’s to tackle a number of problems – not least annual spending of about $50m on transportation and distribution. For example, staff use the data warehouse to build full truckloads carrying as many cases and as much weight as possible, so that trucks are not heading out to retailers half-full.“By analysing the number of orders and volume by day and comparing overloaded days with days where trucks were lightly laden, we found we could reorganise our shipments to even volume out across the days of the week and to send out fewer, better utilised trucks per week,” he says.If supply chain visibility is still an issue for many companies, it isn’t for Welch’s – or for the companies that make up AMR Research’s Supply Chain Top 25, an annual assessment of best practice among some of the world’s biggest companies.Topping the list are Apple, Dell, Procter & Gamble, IBM and Cisco and one of the major traits they have in common is their use of BI to analyse supply chain data, says Mr O’Marah of AMR Research.“These companies are masters of ‘balanced excellence’. What they are able to do is slice and dice data to find ways of running their supply chain in such a way that costs are low but customers stay satisfied.”…………………………………………………………………………………………….Please check the arrival and departure screens for your goodsTwo years ago, while scanning the arrivals and departures screens at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, Joakim Franzen had a moment of insight. As chief information officer for Roxtec International, a Swedish manufacturing company, he’d been looking for a way to make its internal supply chain conditions more visible to its employees around the world. ”It occurred to me that passengers arriving and departing on flights aren’t so different from the inventory that arrives at our company daily and the finished products that we ship out to our customers,” he recalls. With that in mind, he has since set up a 15-inch plasma screens around the company’s offices that display the flow of goods in and out of Roxtec, with colour-coding to indicate how each individual order or delivery has been prioritised. The data that feeds these screens comes from its IFS enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, via bespoke business intelligence (BI) tools built in-house at Roxtec by Mr Franzen’s team. Roxtec makes sealing systems for cables and pipes that are laid in some of the world’s most unforgiving environments, including offshore wind farms and oil rigs. It has a turnover of around €100m a year.With a specialised product set and a workforce scattered around 13 subsidiaries beyond its Swedish headquarters, making sure that everyone is aware of any problems that arise in the supply chain is a challenge, he says. To address the issue, the company completed an upgrade of its ERP system and one of the key aims of this upgrade was to improve supply chain visibility. The first screen Mr Franzen was placed immediately between the desks of employees from the purchasing and customer order departments. ”There were some tensions between these two groups,” he recalls.”If the customer order department needed to ship a product to a customer, but the inventory hadn’t arrived yet, that caused a lot of frustration.”By erecting screens that displayed pending orders and inventory levels, the two departments were able to work out any potential issues as soon as they arose.Similarly, staff in the company’s warehouses look to these screens to see how their picking and packing workload should be organised, to meet agreed delivery dates. ”Previously, we weren’t prioritising orders and the information that employees needed wasn’t available for everyone to see in a simple-to-understand format.“Now, there’s no chance of pick lists and shipment information getting lost, because it’s all up there on-screen,” says Mr Franzen. Like an airport departure screen, the times that shipments are due to leave are listed, along with any outstanding pick-list items for each order. Operation business intelligence, where staff get up-to-the-minute information that enables them to organise their daily tasks, is the kind of BI work that Mr Franzen says he enjoys the most.”It’s great to watch employees gather around the screens to look for any potential bottlenecks and address them before they become a problem. While they’re extremely important, ERP systems don’t usually enable companies to make supply chain information so visible to the people who really need it,” he says.Operational BI enables Roxtec to draw that information from the back-end ERP system to the plasma screens virtually in real-time, he adds. But strategic business intelligence is important to Roxtec, too. Here, Mr Franzen uses tools from BI vendor Qlikview to produce reports on supply chain performance for the Roxtec management team. ”This allows us to take a look at how we performed in terms of getting orders shipped on time last week, last month or last year and stay alert to any trends that emerge.”Roxtec also uses QlikView to keep a close eye on response rates – the time taken between an order coming in from a customer and the time they receive a confirmed delivery date.This is measured in hours and Roxtec aims to keep response times down to less than one working day. ”We need to know that we’re achieving that on a consistent, reliable basis,” says Mr Franzen.
297;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Accounting intelligence: Historians asked to become forecasters;;The biggest challenge in accounting intelligence centres upon the mismatch between the data and the changing role of the chief financial officer (CFO).Since the days of ledgers and quills, the accountant’s role has been essentially that of financial historian, preparing reports to present a year-end snapshot of the state of a company’s finances.With the advent of IT, corporate accounting systems were therefore designed to capture data and do the adding up. In recent decades, market demands for more information – statements of cash flow and more detail on liabilities – added to the data crunching task.But the financial crisis has crystallised a fundamental shift in expectations of the CFO’s role: colleagues want the historian to turn forecaster.“For far too long, accounting has been historic,” says Andrew Meade, managing partner for finance and performance improvement UK and Ireland at advisory firm Accenture.“Companies spend too much time sorting out and reconciling their history before trying to sort out future trends …The real value finance should bring to the table is helping businesses look forward.”Bill Fuessler, IBM Global Financial Management Lead for business consulting, concurs: “In the last 10-15 years most companies have put in some kind of financial system for general ledger.“But the past 18 months have pushed the CFO to the forefront – they have shown it is important also to have information about business risk and metrics. People are looking for forward-looking, predictive measures.”In a business environment of unprecedented uncertainty, executives want every clue they can get to likely changes in their operating environment, and contingency plans to respond to possible scenarios.Many of the key unpredictable factors are financial: changes in commodity prices, currency valuations and interest rates, for example.The abruptness of the credit crisis unleashed by the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008 showed that even banks with the most advanced accounting systems, were unable to produce real-time data on fundamental metrics relating to risk and counterparty exposure.Yet business trends have hugely multiplied the scale of risk. Neil McGovern, Director of Product Strategy at financial systems specialist Sybase, points out that “markets have speeded up five-fold in the past 10 years, so they do the same amount of trading in a day that they used to do in a week”.By simple arithmetic, any trading institution that is not therefore checking its value at risk (a measure of the probability of loss) five times more often has seen the VAR increase.The need for real-time accounting data is particularly acute in financial markets. Regulators and risk managers are demanding much closer monitoring of VAR and counterparty risk.Yet data volumes are so huge that until recently, uploading information to accountants in the middle-office only took place overnight.Many corporate accounting systems are also inadequate for showing accurately the state of the business today, let alone providing clues to future performance.Financial data are often stuck in functional silos, cannot be reconciled, and quality is in any case compromised by “sclerosis” – the failure to modernise systems or even simple data definitions, to match organisational changes.A simple example of sclerosis is a failure to attribute new codes to new types of materials purchased, or even expenses claimed by employees, which leads staff to make “approximate” entries under the most-similar existing code, leading to budgets appearing to grow even as real spending on a particular item is falling.As a result of fragmented legacy systems, poor data quality, lack of standard definitions and so on, many companies simply do not have reliable internal financial intelligence available to the C-suite executives, analysts say.Even when the data are there, Nigel Rayner, research vice-president at Gartner, says: “Our estimate is that only about 20 per cent of companies with the capability regularly use business intelligence functions.”Many finance chiefs still rely on old-fashioned spreadsheets to keep tabs on the company’s finances. No wonder providers of business intelligence systems report strong interest from potential clients.Clearly, the first task of boards and IT chiefs is to find ways to make a harmonised and accurate set of data available, preferably in real-time. Then directors have to choose their key metrics and look at how to answer the questions arising about the future of the business.In the first instance, a finance director needs answers to current questions: how much working capital is tied up in the business? How much in the supply chain? How much are we owed, and what are the numbers and trends in accounts payable and receivable?But as James Fisher, senior director of solution marketing at SAP says, as soon as current information is available, directors want forward indicators, from sales, marketing and production, so that they can extrapolate future financial performance.Only once future financial trends in the business are clear, can directors start to monitor indicators and model strategies to improve future performance or react to challenges such as falling customer satisfaction.“You have to include monitoring and build in remediation plans,” says Mr Fisher.“Many organisations are not achieving this closed-loop.”Today, he says, technology enables companies to start posing the question: “What if?” – that is, to model what would happen to sales and profitability if they raised or lowered prices, reduced a product range, or added a new line within a particular price bracket.It is only once data become useful information of this sort, says Accenture’s Mr Meade, that the CFO can really start adding value in the way boardroom colleagues want.With the right financial information, he says, a finance chief could help them make better decisions across the organisation, from reshaping business models to signing tomorrow’s stars in the music industry.
298;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-11-16T04:40:07Z;Standards and quality: Wider responsibilities move up agenda;;"Management consultants are pilloried when projects go wrong, especially public sector work that is subject to official scrutiny. It is vital for consultants to be able to demonstrate to the wider business community and to the general public that they not only apply appropriate quality standards to their work, but contribute to the wider common good.“The global economic crisis has created new demands on businesses for reliable and sustainable performance,” says Adrian Godfrey, chief operating officer for global advisory services at Ernst & Young. “We need to show how our profession contributes, not just to stabilising and revitalising individual organisations, but to the global financial future. We do this by providing value directly to our clients and indirectly to their employees, retirees, local communities and local and global economies.”Traditionally management consulting services were procured directly by senior managers, who understood how the profession adds value. However, engagements are increasingly being established by procurement professionals, who are not all familiar with the consulting industry. They rely on well-established generic procurement procedures, which inevitably concentrate not on value potential, but on quality standards – in an industry where all you need to be a consultant is a suit and a business card.In the UK the Institute for Business Consulting has a two-page code of professional conduct and practice that applies to individuals who are members. This has recently been supplemented by a similar document from Management Consultancies Association (MCA) that applies to member firms.It requires them to put their client’s interests first; focus on delivering sustainable value to the client; employ people with the right skills and experience to help their client, and continually develop their expertise; be clear and transparent with the client; be trustworthy, independent and objective; and be financially strong enough to deliver on their commitments. Alan Leaman, chief executive of the association, says that codes of practice must be dynamic, with good practice developing as the business world develops.“There is a big responsibility on the industry to explain what it does more effectively and for members to be advocates and standard bearers for high standards and quality service,” he says. “This is intended to be a ‘kite mark’ that gives buyers reassurance that they are buying a quality service. It will also give them and the general public a more positive understanding of what consultancy is about at its best, which will pay dividends for years to come.”The big global firms have all produced their own statements of ethics, codes of conduct and internal quality assurance processes. Codes, such as that from the MCA, will help procurement professionals to evaluate these diverse documents against a common minimum standard.“Consulting companies need to embed the code into their way of working, not just sign up to it,” says David Thomlinson, a managing director at Accenture. “This is not just good for the industry and its clients, but is essential for attracting new talent into the industry.”Along with most large global companies, BT’s senior managers used to employ hundreds of different consultancies around the world. It now uses a list of 60 approved consultancies. Stephen Hayers, its vice-president for services procurement, says that using too many consultancies makes it difficult for a firm to get to know the organisation intimately.“We are looking to get more value by working with fewer firms, so they understand us better and are able to deliver quality work,” he says. “The pre-vetting procedure means we work with organisations that have the right approach, the right values, the right cultural fit and the right commercial terms.”Mr Hayers says codes of practice must be simple, easily understood and aligned to what the market wants. Consultancies need to be motivated to want to work with them, otherwise they are meaningless. A commitment to quality standards will get a firm in, but its tangible performance will be evaluated at the end of the engagement.Colm Reilly, head of PA Consulting Group’s government practice, says the problem is not that no one knows what to do, but that it is just not done systematically. Standards and protocols already exist but are not always used. His solution is a rigorous and consistent focus on the basics of project management and their implementation.Critical to adding value successfully is agreeing the objectives and scope of the work, together with the benefits to be expected and how they will be measured. Mr Thomlinson says that consulting, more than ever, has to be action oriented. “With the recent economic turmoil, clients want more tangible, practical approaches to managing and growing their businesses,” he says. “Deliverables need to be tangible and practical, rarely a report or slide deck.”Consulting is very much a two-way relationship and clients also have a responsibility for ensuring that value is added. John Lockton, managing director of LCP Consulting, points out that clients need to provide as clear a brief as possible, which identifies the value that the project will bring.“People must understand who we are, what we do and how we achieve sustainable mutual advantage,” concludes Mr Godfrey. “Helping companies to stay in business and people to stay employed is all part of responsible consultancy.”"
299;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-11-16T04:40:07Z;Financial services: Help needed as banks leave bunker;;All eyes in the consulting industry are fixed on financial services sector, which acts as bellwether for the whole industry. The banks took the world into recession, but 18 months after the demise of Bear Stearns, the US investment bank, they are leading the consulting industry out of the recession.The latest Quarterly Trends in Consultancy Buying report, from sourceforconsulting.com, which researches the consulting industry, found that while overall consultancy spend decreased by more than 25 per cent in the last six months, 27 per cent of financial services companies interviewed spent more, some by more than 50 per cent.“It was investment banks and capital markets that first pulled in their horns, then the retail banks,” says Fiona Czerniawska, the site’s co-founder. “Because they were first in, they are also first out of the recession, which is the same pattern we saw in 1997 and 2002. Two years further on they have got their houses in order and their profits are starting to pick up. They have moved out of their ‘bunker’ mentality to look at what they have to do in the new competitive landscape.”The forced restructuring of the banking industry has created a lot of consultancy work. Some banks are dealing with mergers, some are preparing to divest non-core business and new banks are emerging from outside the industry, such as Tesco and Virgin Money.“There were a number of forced marriages during the financial crisis and there is going to be a lot of clean-up work for the next couple of years,” says Simon Rawlings, group managing director at PIPC.Simon Kent, managing director for UK financial services consulting at Navigant, sees a “footrace” going on over the course of the next two years as the landscape of the banking industry is reshaped. Existing banks are sorting themselves out and trying to reposition themselves to face the new challenger banks, such as Tesco, that have an opportunity over the next two years to take market share by benefiting from the reduction in trust that consumers have with their banks.“The competitive landscape will require very different propositions to both consumers and shareholders,” says Graham Lloyd, a financial services specialist at PA Consulting Group. “The consultant will become a trusted adviser, bringing new ideas, alternative perspectives and challenging the way clients do things. Above all it will be value-added insights that will help clients make a real difference with their growth strategies.”However Ian Holden, UK partner for financial services at BearingPoint, says profitable growth strategies are being held back by lack of information. He says banks cannot accurately report on product profitability, benchmark themselves against rivals or determine which customer segments they should pursue.“The key is not to gain marginal efficiencies through running faster, it is to identify which direction you should be running,” says Mr Holden. “Slightly reducing costs on a loss-making product will not generate significant bottom-line profitability, but rapidly divesting loss-making customer segments and products will.”The problem that organisations in every sector have faced is that the urgent need to cut costs for short-term survival can damage their ability to profit from growth when it returns.“It can lead to mistakes when assessing which assets are core and which are vital to the new strategy,” says Andrew Gray, partner in financial services consulting at PwC. “Longer-term decisions need to be derived from basic thinking around the customer value proposition, the ability to derive value and appropriate levels of risk and reward.”Mr Gray says that in some cases institutions are investing to correct years of under-investment, frequently in their back offices. Others are looking to transform their business model to be competitive for the next five to 10 years.Chris Harvey, global head of banking and securities at Deloitte, predicts that the coming wave of innovation will be focused on customer intimacy and service delivery excellence. This will include optimising existing investments in customer relationship management and associated technologies and more targeted segmentation and value proposition analysis.Mr Holden at BearingPoint says the banks are concerned that regulators may require them to split off operations, reduce branch networks, exit markets or change their product mix. This will require uncoupling systems and processes that have cost them millions to integrate, a very expensive and complicated process that adds nothing to their bottom line.The insurance sector went into the recession later, so is still involved with cost cutting rather than new strategic opportunities. “Cost structures of the insurers were still geared up for the good days just before the crisis, so they need to realign to the new reality,” says Edwin van der Ouderaa, a senior executive in Accenture’s financial services practice.The current instability in the sector provides an opportunity to bring innovation to the consulting market. Maintaining an established business model while waiting for more work may not be a winning strategy.“Some consultancies will need to change their approach, to be more commercially agile and flexible, whilst investing much more heavily in truly innovative and fresh thinking,” says Rick Freeman, head of financial services consulting at Capgemini UK. “The future belongs to those who have the ability to reinvent themselves.”Ms Czerniawska at sourceforconsulting.com warns that although the signs look good for financial services consulting at the moment, it is too early to tell if the whole consulting industry will move quickly out of the downturn. “There are still sectors pulling in their horns on expenditure and it will take them time to emerge from recession,” she says. “I wouldn’t expect to see a big improvement in consulting until part of the way through 2010.”
300;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-11-05T23:20:38Z;Capgemini aims for top five in US;;Paul Hermelin, chief executive of Capgemini, is planning a series of acquisitions to strengthen the French IT services company’s position in the US market.Capgemini is the largest European IT services company by sales, but Mr Hermelin said he would like also to see it among the top five US technology services providers, alongside competitors such as Accenture and IBM.“We are number 19 in the US IT services market and …we must be in the top five to be credible,” Mr Hermelin told the Financial Times. He added that he would also consider purchases in Asia and in new technologies.Finding new areas of growth are essential for the group. On Thursday, it disappointed investors by revealing a 7.3 per cent fall in third-quarter sales to €1.9bn ($2.8bn), below market expectations. The company lowered sales forecasts for the year, now expecting a 5 per cent fall in sales, compared with earlier estimates for a 3 to 4 per cent fall.Shares in Capgemini, which have gained more than 15 per cent over the past year, fell 4.2 per cent to €31.13 on Thursday.Mr Hermelin said the market had been softer than expected in September and October, with many companies still reluctant to spend money on large IT projects. This week competitor Logica was also forced to lower guidance for the year.Mr Hermelin is hoping to return the company to growth by the end of 2010 through acquisitions and investment into five key areas including smart metering, software testing, application development, business information management, and data management. These are expected to add €800m to revenues next year.The company has maintained its target for a 7 per cent operating margin for the year, in part thanks to a €220m restructuring programme and a pay freeze since January. Mr Hermelin first told the FT of plans for a US spending spree in early 2008, but the economic downturn put them on hold. Capgemini has a war chest of €576m cash to spend on acquisitions, but was reluctant to use this during the crisis.“Twelve months ago I didn’t want to stretch the balance sheet. There was so much concern about conserving cash. Now it is the end of the storm,” Mr Hermelin said.However, he said the company was reluctant to pay “crazy” valuations such as the $3.9bn that Dell paid to buy Perot Systems. “I don’t imagine a large deal, but something more focused,” Mr Hermelin said.Executives at Capgemini are still haunted by its $11bn acquisition of Ernst & Young’s consulting business in 2000, which plunged the company into turmoil for several years. The company’s biggest deal since was the $1.2bn acquisition of Kanbay International in India, which has formed the basis of Capgemini’s operations on the subcontinent.However, the company is now in an increasingly expansive mood. This month it announced plans to create a new business information management unit in Bangalore. It will be a pivotal move for the company, increasing its workforce in India to beyond 21,000 people, more than its headcount in France of about 20,000.
301;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-11-04T00:25:17Z;Cisco and EMC form joint venture;;Cisco Systems made a significant bid for a bigger slice of the corporate data centre market on Tuesday by joining with data storage firm EMC to offer bundled computing gear and services.The alliance with EMC and EMC’s majority-owned VMware is aimed at dislodging Hewlett-Packard and IBM from atop the $350bn annual market for core computing products, consulting and maintenance.HP, IBM and Dell also sell equipment with software from VMware that can make it seem as if multiple computers are running on the same equipment, a technique called virtualisation that offers flexibility and cost savings. For now, Cisco is still behind, analysts said.But the Cisco’s joint venture, dubbed Acadia, will bundle EMC storage gear, VMware management tools and Cisco networking and computing products with dedicated services - “a single throat to choke,” EMC chief executive Joseph Tucci told the Financial Times.Cisco’s chief executive, John Chambers, told the FT that the deal could be the most significant technology alliance in a decade. “This is about changing the industry,” Mr Chambers said. “The play is $85bn in terms of market opportunity.”The dominant maker of networking equipment, Cisco hopes to use the trend toward simulated machines and cloud services, through which core mechanical processes can be delivered from afar, to sell more of its fledgling server line.Acadia will start with 140 employees, but most of the sales of the new technology bundles, called Vblocks, are expected to come from outside consulting firms such as Accenture, Computer Sciences and Tata.“Allying with those known quantities and with EMC should accelerate broader acceptance of Cisco’s servers,” said analyst James Staten of Forrester.“The initial introduction is sort of a catch-up, but where they plan to go with it has more legs,” Mr Staten said of the new venture.Cisco’s top target is former ally Hewlett-Packard, and it even timed its news to steal thunder from an HP announcement of new data centre products scheduled for Wednesday. HP plans to tout its vision of combined storage, computing power and virtualisation that will require fewer standalone networking products such as those sold by Cisco.
302;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-11-01T19:44:54Z;Capgemini in India milestone;;Capgemini has revealed that it will soon have more staff in India than it does in its home market of France – in an indication of the growing power of the subcontinent in the global outsourcing industry.The European IT group is creating a new business information management unit in Bangalore, India’s Silicon Valley, which will help increase its workforce in the country to beyond 21,000 people, more than its headcount in France of about 20,000.“We are able to access abundant application and technical skills in business information management in India and we can scale up there much more quickly than we could in onshore locations,” said Paul Nannetti, general manager of Capgemini’s global business information service line.India’s computer services and business process outsourcing industry experienced one of the most difficult periods in its history during the global financial crisis as many of its largest clients, the world’s banking multinationals, fell deeply into the red.A recent McKinsey study predicted the sector would miss its target of hitting revenues of $60bn by 2010 as it faces pricing pressure and falls in the volume of business.However, the industry has recently begun clawing back business, as its clients begin work on integrating acquisitions made during the downturn and try to cut costs.Before the crisis, India’s domestic IT leaders, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Technologies and Wipro, were already facing growing competition in the low-cost offshore outsourcing business from global leaders such as Capgemini, IBM and Accenture. The western multinationals began ramping up their workforces in India to enable them to tap low-cost talent in the country.US-based IBM’s Indian workforce was 74,000 in 2007, the latest figures available, but earlier this year was reported to be shifting more jobs to India. Accenture has been increasing its numbers in India at a similar pace in recent years.Salil Parekh, Capgemini India executive chairman, said the group’s headcount in the country was expected to show “high single digit” percentage growth this year and would next year register a double digit increase. Capgemini’s Mr Nannetti said the company was establishing a new business information management centre of excellence in Bangalore that would start with a workforce of 1,000, scaling up to 3,000 in about 18 months.Business information management, a service that helps companies to improve their collection, use and analysis of data, is one of the areas for which India’s large talent pool is particularly attractive.It can involve the use of multiple sources of information, from the weather to shipping schedules, to build a more complete picture for a client of its business performance.
303;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-10-12T23:34:52Z;The US: States chart own course on climate change;;At the start of the year, the US energy industry was looking to Congress and the Obama administration to set the tone for the future of energy in America with a swift passage of the Waxman-Markey climate bill.But political posturing and infighting has meant there has yet to be any significant movement on that front.That does not mean there has been no movement on charting a new course for energy.Even as carbon legislation remains stalled, companies are getting on with energy efficiencies and alternatives. Squeezing efficiencies out of energy use is not a new field, but it has never been more popular.Jim Davis, president of Chevron Energy Solutions, has been involved in energy efficiency for more than 20 years – since 2000 at Chevron, the US’ second-biggest oil company.“We’ve been green before green was hip and cool,” he jokes. Chevron has improved its energy efficiency by 28 per cent since 1992, resulting in $3bn in annual energy savings in 2008. “Energy saved is energy found,” he says.Chevron is the only one of the majors to have carved out a niche serving the US public sector, improving efficiencies everywhere from public (state) schools to military bases to offices of the federal government, the largest consumer of energy in the world.Despite headlines hyping the importance of “renewables”, Mr Davis says it is even more important first to make the US more energy efficient. “It doesn’t make sense to put solar on rooftops of a very inefficient building.”To improve efficiencies, companies are doing everything from installing energy-efficient lightbulbs, airconditioning or heating systems to caulking windows to prevent leakage and putting jackets on water heaters to enable the water to retain its heat longer.Many are using smart meters to ensure the best use of power. These meters allow customers to see how much their power use is costing them at any moment, to encourage them to, for example, do the laundry later, when renewables, such as wind, are supplying the grid.Utilities are using new technologies to see precisely how much power is being used at any given time, to provide the right level of supply, and where the outages are so they can immediately fix them.This is all part of the “smart grid” concept of improving the efficiency of the electrical system by increasing the observerability by both producers and users, says Jeff Taft, smart grid chief architect at Accenture, the consultancy.He is leading an effort to build a smart grid in Boulder, Colorado, acting as consulting chief engineer for Xcel Energy’s SmartGridCity project, which is bringing together 70 or more pilots of new technologies to improve efficiencies across the city. “It’s a testing laboratory,” says Mr Taft.Except that the $100m project is being carried out in a real city and is expected to be permanent, as Boulder seeks to be among an intelligent cities network Accenture is promoting around the world.Across the US, entire states are moving ahead without Congress.About 30 states are imposing renewable and/or alternative portfolio standards. These require electric utilities to generate a certain percentage of their power in those states from renewable or alternative energies.California is leading the pack, with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signing an executive order on September 15, directing the state to increase its standard to 33 per cent by 2020.Carbon legislation is expected in the US at some point to complement these efforts, but how much it will raise the cost of fossil fuel-based energy and how quickly remains to be seen.“The challenge for the country is finding the right balance,”’ says Charles Swanson, Houston office managing partner for Ernst & Young.He says it is crucial that the US migrate from fossil fuels and into renewables without raising the cost of energy so much that the US becomes uncompetitive. “Walking that fine line is the challenge.”But Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at Rice University, notes that the US has for years had cheaper energy than Europe and Japan, yet that has not increased the US competitiveness, as can be seen by the demise of US carmakers.“Those countries already have higher energy costs than the US, and it hasn’t made any difference at all,” Ms Jaffe says. “It is not a meaningful distinction.”She notes that nobody worried about the US’ competitiveness last year when oil and natural gas prices were at record highs, but if climate legislation pushes up prices suddenly, everyone against the Waxman-Markey energy bill expects it will create a competitiveness problem.“Why weren’t we worried about being competitive last year, when prices were so high?”Considering all the giveaways to the coal industry contained in the Waxman-Markey bill that passed through the House and is now being debated in the Senate, Ms Jaffe says the US would be better off without such a bill. If the bill contains exemptions that let coal continue to pollute, that would be worse than doing nothing.If left to an even playing field, she says, natural gas, which is cheaper and increasingly plentiful with new technology, would be likely to supplant coal use because it is going to be less expensive than coal and has about half the carbon emissions as coal.“If you actually care about climate, we would be better off doing nothing instead of passing Waxman-Markey.”
304;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Willis latest to leave low-tax Bermuda;;Willis, the world’s third-largest insurance broker, plans to move its global headquarters from Bermuda to the Irish Republic, becoming the latest in a string of multinational companies to leave the low-tax Caribbean island.The company said Dublin provided “a more stable environment” and would improve Willis’s ability to “maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate”.Willis follows Accenture, the consulting group, and about 10 others in announcing a move away from Bermuda since Barack Obama became US president and began to take a much tougher line on tax havens, saying their widespread use by American businesses was “the biggest tax scam in the world”.This has stoked fears of a crackdown on Bermuda-based companies that have significant operations in the US and worries about potential reputational damage from being seen as a tax avoider.Joseph Plumeri, Willis’s chairman and chief executive, said Ireland offered long-established commercial relationships, trade agreements and tax treaties with European Union members, the US and other countries where Willis does business.“We reviewed a number of alternatives with our board and believe that incorporating in Ireland will provide Willis with economic benefits and help ensure our continued global competitiveness,” he said.The move was “clearly about remaining ahead of the curve in terms of what might or might not happen in Bermuda”, said one person close to the group.Richard Irvine, a tax partner for PwC based in Bermuda, said there were several pieces of US legislation in the pipeline that could adversely affect companies based in countries that did not have tax treaties with the US in place.“The US Congress is involved in a fairly extensive debate on healthcare, leaving less time to focus on tax havens,” he said.“But there are still a number of legislative proposals that were put forward in the presidential budget, which are mostly focused internally on US companies with complex tax structures.”Willis is a US company, but was domiciled in London until 2001 when it moved to Bermuda ahead of its initial public offering in New York that summer.Bermuda is home to a large reinsurance industry, which dominates the island economy.
305;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-09-20T21:36:48Z;Mittal puts shine on steel outlook;;Lakshmi Mittal has built a glittering career – and made a lot of money – from being optimistic when it comes to the global steel industry.Even so, is the Indian billionaire becoming a tad over-excited about the potential for a strong recovery in steelmaking next year?Mr Mittal – chairman and main owner of Arcelor-Mittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker – has gone on record as saying that global steel demand could rise by more than 10 per cent in 2010.The increase in global production envisaged by Mr Mittal would come after a big fall in output this year, expected by most onlookers to be about 15 per cent.The size of the year-on-year decline in steel demand in 2009 will almost certainly be the biggest since the second world war.John Lichtenstein, head of the metals industry group at Accenture, the consulting company, says he thinks world steel production next year will rebound by 8-10 per cent.But it is likely the growth will be the “at the lower end” of this spectrum. “While a growth rate of greater than 10 per cent is a possibility, this would be at the higher end of industry projections,” Mr Lichtenstein says.Mr Mittal has built up his company over the past 20 years through making a series of bold bets on expansion in what many used to regard as a sunset industry.However, since demand for steel began to plummet around a year ago, ArcelorMittal has been among the hardest hit in the industry.While the company made 116m tonnes of steel in 2007, this year the total could be down to about 70m, or around 30 per cent lower than in 2008.After turning in earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of $24.5bn in 2008, the company is thought likely to produce an equivalent figure of only $6.5bn-$8bn this year.Most steelmakers – and ArcelorMittal is no exception – rely on sheer volume of output to drive up profits. So Mr Mittal is relying on a substantial boost in demand to restore earnings to what he regards as more healthy levels.He needs a period of higher profits to erase worries about the company’s high level of net debt – which the company intends to bring down to $22bn by the end of the year.While he is not postulating any sudden return to the output levels in the global industry of recent years – in fact world steel production may not climb much above the 1.3bn tonnes recorded in 2007 until 2012, according to Mr Mittal’s thinking – he reckons the pick-up next year could be stronger than many have predicted.Behind this view is an expectation that the multi-billion dollar stimulus packages unveiled over the past year by governments to tackle the financial crisis will deliver an economic boost more substantial than that foreseen by others in the industry.He is also counting on China – which this year is expected to account for nearly half of world steel production and consumption – to grow strongly both this year and next.However, this is where some in the industry have slightly different views.Wolfgang Eder, chief executive of Voestalpine, a large Austrian steelmaker which has plants around the world, including in China and the US, says the longer-term impact of these stimulus packages is still not clear.“We’ve seen a pick-up in demand [in the steel industry] but this has been driven more by companies building up inventories [after a long period of destocking] than any sign of a return to normal growth,” Mr Eder says.While he says that next year steel demand globally could strengthen by 7-8 per cent, Mr Eder is keen to play down expectations.“In the steel industry we are still in a trough, even though we are looking as hard as we can for positive signs.”As for China, Dan Dimicco, chairman of Nucor, a large US steelmaker, says that even though so far this year the Chinese steel industry has been more resilient than many expected, he foresees “a definite weakening” in output and demand in China during the next few months.While Mr Dimicco is not alone in the industry in voicing such thoughts, others share Mr Mittal’s more upbeat views.B. Muthuraman, chief executive of Tata Steel of India, believes steel demand in China could expand by 10-11 per cent in the year to March 2011, after growth of 9-10 per cent in the 12 months to March next year, with similarly strong expansion in consumption in India.“In the steel industry as a whole I can see a return to confidence and this is a good thing,” Mr Muthuraman says.In general, many in the steel industry regard Mr Mittal’s detailed figures about likely growth next year with a degree of scepticism.However, given his track record, few are prepared to say categorically that he will be wrong.

307;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-09-16T10:03:30Z;LSE buys MillenniumIT to cut costs;;The London Stock Exchange on Wednesday turned to the Indian subcontinent to help reduce its huge technology costs, snapping up Sri Lankan company MillenniumIT in a $30m (£18m) deal that the exchange hopes will help it fend off nimbler rivals.The move marks the most significant strategic step yet taken by Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, to arrest the exchange’s declining market share since taking over from Dame Clara Furse five months ago.The LSE’s share of trading in FTSE 100 stocks has frequently dipped below 60 per cent so far this month. The share of Chi-X Europe, one of a handful of “multilateral trading facilities”, is more than 20 per cent.The LSE’s TradElect trading system, upgraded only two years ago at a cost of £40m, is a significant burden on the exchange as it is run partly by a large support staff originally “in-sourced” from Accenture. Technology represents 47 per cent of the LSE’s total costs.The purchase of MillenniumIT gives the LSE control of its own technology, while keeping development costs low since the company’s main base is in Sri Lanka.The LSE said the transaction would save the company “at least” £10m in development and operational costs from the 2011-12 financial year.David Lester, chief information officer, told the Financial Times: “If you think of the expense we have with external software providers and you compare that with Sri Lanka, it’s a huge cost saving. There is also the intellectual software we get.”MillenniumIT, founded in 1996 by former Oracle Sri Lanka country manager Tony Weeresinghe, has 450 staff based at a campus outside Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital. Most of its top IT staff were educated in the US at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University, as well as in Britain.Asked why the LSE had bought the whole company, rather than hiring its technology, Mr Rolet said there was a “strategic danger” that the company could have been snapped up by a rival exchange or company after any technology deal had been agreed.“Having an opportunity eventually to acquire the [software] codes does not protect you enough. We felt over time that the best way was an acquisition,” he said. “Technology is a long-term, strategic commitment for an exchange.”The LSE said MillenniumIT’s technology would “provide [it] with a highly scalable and very low latency in-house developed trading system with multi-asset class functionality and quicker product speed to market.“In addition, the transaction will give MillenniumIT the backing of the group to enable it to develop further its global exchange technology business.”Mr Weeresinghe will stay on and report to Mr Rolet.The LSE will unveil a plan to migrate its customers from TradElect to a new system next month. Mr Lester said: “We want to do it before the end of next year. We think we can do it quickly.”He said he would be forming a three-person “transition team”, two of whom would move permanently to Sri Lanka.
308;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-08-10T08:17:20Z;Working capital;;Cash, as the old saying goes, is king. But for companies eyeing faltering revenues in sputtering economies, it is also queen and jack: no one can have enough of it on the balance sheet.After cutting costs, the next best place for companies to extract cash is from working capital – money used to keep a business ticking over, tied up in receivables, payables and inventory. Some want more of it: a recent $68m rights issue by Metro International, the world’s largest free newspaper publisher, was solely to fund working capital for the year. But many more companies want less of it and are finding ways to release trapped cash. This can be a great way of appeasing lenders and credit rating agencies but needs to be done carefully.Take payables. Accenture, the consultancy, reckons that for every $1bn a manufacturer spends on supplies, $50m is paid too early. Some companies don’t find this wasteful, preferring to pay quickly to keep supplies secure and partners happy. Also, not every company can throw its weight around like Tesco. The UK’s largest retailer has irked some suppliers by extending bill payments to 60 days.Then there is inventory. The recent trend has been towards just-in-time ordering, the theory being that the less money tied up in stock sitting on shelves, the better. However, trimming inventories means more frequent movements of smaller stock quantities, which increases warehouse and freight costs. The balancing act is particularly delicate for volume retailers, such as supermarkets, which try to keep inventories at about 5 per cent of sales.One consequence of pushing too hard on working capital is that it can leave a business ill-equipped to deal with an upturn.Indeed, the thinner and more tightly managed supply chains become, the greater the probability of bottlenecks as orders recover. Companies would then be aced by their own initiative.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
309;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Time out to help less fortunate is its own reward;;In early 2008, David Liverseidge left the comparative comfort of the UK offices of AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company, and moved to northern Mongolia for three months to work at a business incubator. “Although this sounds very sophisticated it mostly involved giving people very basic business planning advice – asking questions like will your business be profitable?” he explains.Mr Liverseidge took on this placement as part of AstraZeneca’s partnership with VSO, the development organisation. AstraZeneca held his job open and continued to pay him, albeit at a reduced salary. “You feel that you are contributing something to the country, but also that you are developing yourself,” he says. “You learn to deal with very different cultures and you have to live without the corporate security blanket.”Volunteering is also popular at Accenture, the consultancy. “At one end of the spectrum, staff can take up to three days off to volunteer in the community, and at the other there are much more full-on career propositions,” says Gib Bulloch, director of Accenture Development Partnerships. “People are allowed to go for six to 12 months. I went to Macedonia in 2000 to provide consulting support for a small business development centre just after the Kosovo crisis.”Mr Bulloch says Accenture is in effect running a social enterprise unit within the organisation – and one that is meant to break even financially. The company contributes, the employees contribute (via a cut in pay when they are doing it) and the client will pay a fee – although it is a fraction of the market cost. Projects range from extending mobile phone ownership in developing countries to educating nurses in Kenya. An ADP project will typically have a small but full consultancy team working on it.Judith Brodie, VSO’s UK director, notes that, whereas people used to volunteer to teach English, volunteers are now more likely to be training teachers or even acting as head teachers. “We now tend to recruit far more people with professional skills and deploy them at a strategic level,” she explains. “I met a management consultant in Gambia recently – he had no experience of healthcare, but was working with the management of a hospital and having a real impact.”Not all corporate volunteering is long term or involves far-off locations. Peter Bull, head of HSBC in the Community, says the bank lets staff volunteer to teach local schoolchildren how to deal with money. “It adds value to the community and develops staff esteem,” he says.HSBC also offers longer secondments and this year will send away 2,500 staff to spend two weeks working for the bank’s environmental charity.Of course, companies do not just do this sort of thing out of unalloyed altruism: they get something back too. Volunteering offers employees everything from leadership development to exposing them to developing markets. It can also be a powerful retention tool, especially for long-serving staff who are looking for new challenges.In the recession, there may be other reasons to support volunteering. Ms Brodie says VSO has developed a secondment programme for its corporate partners partly “to help [the businesses] retain staff and keep them motivated during quiet periods”. KPMG, the professional services firm, is advertising three auditing roles with the programme.Of course, businesses are also aware that those who have chosen to volunteer typically take a salary cut. This can be anything from 25 per cent to about 70 per cent. Many people will happily absorb such a short-term cut for the chance to volunteer, though for some it may be a longer-term arrangement: Mr Bulloch says he has been on 75 per cent of full pay for seven years.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
311;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-06-26T20:00:00Z;LSE takes tough new approach to technology;;On the top floor of the London Stock Exchange, a glass cabinet displays some of the silverware that the 208-year old bourse has amassed over the past century, much of it given by City luminaries to past chairmen of the exchange.One is an intricate Italian Rosewater dish from 1620 – a gift from a governor of the Bank of England shortly after the first world war.But if this week’s job losses at the LSE are any indication, under Xavier Rolet, the Frenchman who succeeded Dame Clara Furse as chief executive a month ago, the exchange is starting to break with long history.Mr Rolet, who ran trading operations at Lehman Brothers, is taking the axe to the LSE’s staff, cutting 10 per cent – or 120 people – this week.More cuts are likely in coming months.The exchange’s technology is also being overhauled – again.The LSE appears set to dump TradElect, a share trading system that was upgraded by Accenture, the consultancy, only a year ago.Costing £40m, TradElect was Dame Clara’s flagship project.For those with long memories, its demise will remind them of the exchange’s often troubled relationship with technology.Much of that has been due to relying on outside consultants and software companies to build and maintain its systems.Yet executives at exchanges increasingly believe that having the best technology and being able to control its costs are vital to their ability to compete for the vast pool of traders around the world.Traders want to access exchanges electronically, using systems that allow them to get trades done in milliseconds, at the cheapest price possible.Just less than half of the LSE’s total cost base is swallowed up by technology.The exchange is facing competition from much smaller trading facilities, such as Chi-X which has managed to capture an 18 per cent market share in FTSE 100 stocks with a staff of just 36.The LSE has a chequered track record in relying solely on third parties to deliver such systems reliably and on time.It reached a low point with technology in 1993, when it abandoned Taurus, a securities settlement system developed by Coopers & Lybrand, the former accounting firm. At about the same time, the LSE appointed Andersen Consulting – later Accenture – to develop Sequence, a project designed to migrate all of its existing multiple trading systems onto a single platform.Peter Rawlins, the LSE’s chief executive at the time, stunned the City by announcing that Taurus was being abandoned due to budget over-runs and repeated delays.Hundreds of LSE staff and consultants were laid off. “It was a complete shambles and sucked in vast number of people on vastly inflated salaries,” says one person involved at the time. The blunder cost the LSE more than £50m.Mr Rolet – who was a specialist in trading systems at Lehman – appears to believe that the LSE must take direct control of its technology if it is to stand a chance of winning the technological race between exchanges.Some of the foundations for the new approach were laid in the closing weeks of Dame Clara’s tenure when the LSE agreed a deal with TMX, the Canadian exchange, under which the LSE will buy the software rights to the Toronto-based bourse’s Sola trading system for derivatives.The LSE has declined to say what the next steps will be on technology. But it will be acutely aware of the need to ensure there is no repeat of Taurus and TradElect, which itself involved “in-sourcing” over 100 IT staff from Accenture.And as if Mr Rolet needed reminding of the urgency of the task, the LSE’s transatlantic rival NYSE Euronext, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, this week unveiled a deal with Juniper Networks, a trading technology company, to develop a system that will make its trading systems among the world’s fastest.
312;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-06-17T15:18:38Z;Wireless security: Data fills the airwaves – who is listening ?;;"“Data,” says Howard Schmidt, professor, and president of the international Information Security Forum, “is the gold, the silver and the diamonds of the world we live in, so no matter how someone gets access to your data – whether it’s through a lost piece of media or a wireless network, it’s just as dangerous and troublesome as if someone broke in and stole the entire computer system.”This is why companies worldwide are worrying about the challenge presented by the growth of wireless networking. Richard Levine of Accenture, a consultancy, remembers how at one time the chief information officer mandated how an employee could connect to the network. “Today, they have expectations of how they want to connect and if you don’t give them the hardware and network to do it, they will find their own.”Even the jargon associated with networking security carries a whiff of menace: “evil twins”, the “man-in-the-middle*” and “split tunnelling**” are just some of the dangers facing companies and their employees. “It is an arms race,” says Rob Cotton, chief executive of NCC Group, a company that tests the integrity of corporate networks. “Hackers will break through virtually anything when it becomes advantageous for them to do so.” His own, 100-strong team of “ethical hackers“ claims a 97.8 per cent success rate in hacking into corporate networks in the course of their wholly legitimate activities.The mobility conferred by lightweight, affordable portable devices and ubiquitous wireless networks has been hailed as the next and most important business trend as employees enjoy access to the data they need to do their jobs anyhow, anywhere and anytime.But wireless networks are notoriously vulnerable to hacking – especially public Wi-Fi “hotspots”, which are unlikely to have security or encryption protection – and the experts are unanimous in claiming that constant vigilance is the only answer: “You must never believe you are secure,” Mr Cotton urges. “The only time we have discovered a network that is safe is when it is switched off.”Kurt Roemer, chief security strategist at Citrix, says organisations have spent millions on security measures to little avail: “The ubiquity of wireless coupled with the fact that users will sign up to whichever available network is easiest, means there is no way for an organisation to own and control the end-to-end network.“Investment in outdated wireless security measures such as WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is rendered worthless when an employee opts for an unprotected network – or when a hacker can use a ‘point and hack’ tool to expose the network in less than 60 seconds.”The good news, according to Paul Meakin, portfolio manager for Damovo, the services group, is that the right technology and the right security policies can go a long way to protecting both company and employees: “Remote workers must ensure they are protecting their devices and businesses must ensure they can manage them.“Devices such as laptops, mobile phones and USB sticks should be encrypted; otherwise they will be wide open to data access. Ideally, companies should have a ‘remote device wipe’ enabled so that all data can be destroyed in the case of loss or theft.” Sensitive data should not be stored on local devices, he urges, suggesting that proprietary technologies that enable a virtual encrypted disk to be created on the machine in use should be used. These make it possible to wipe the disk at the end of each session.Some argue, however, that data leaks through less technological loopholes. Bob Tarzey, of the consultancy Quocirca, says: “I could not put an accurate figure on it, but I would venture that 99 per cent of sensitive data being compromised through the use of wireless is through the loss or theft of the access device itself, which could be a laptop, netbook or smartphone, rather than the deliberate interception of wireless network traffic. This is the problem on which IT managers should focus. It requires the encryption of stored data.”Security specialists agree, however, that basic defence measures such as up-to-date firewalls and anti-virus software are critically important for any device that is to be connected to the internet. Dave Hughes, director of wireless broadband for BT Business in the UK warns: “For businesses and individuals that are concerned about their data being intercepted over the internet, we strongly recommend the use of a secure remote access virtual private network using either IPSec or SSL technology. This is an important common practice for both wired and wireless connections.”IPSec is a set of rules that authenticates and encrypts each packet of data across a network using internet technology. SSL or Secure Socket Layer and its successor Transport Layer Security also provide cryptographic protection for messages travelling across a network so as to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and forgery.BT operates a network of Wi-Fi hot spots called BT Openzone that can be vulnerable to the “evil twin” scam where a rogue access point pretends to be a legitimate Openzone point with a view to obtaining names, passwords and credit card numbers. Mr Hughes says customers should check that their browser displays a padlock symbol indicating a secured page, the address www.btopenzone.com and that no certificate error dialogue box pops up during log-in: “If these conditions are met, you can be sure that it’s a genuine BTOpenzone access point you are connecting to.“Remote working using Wi-Fi is perfectly safe provided basic precautions are taken and, as we know, accessing broadband out and about is a really powerful and increasingly essential aid to business,” he says.Dave Hartley, security consultant with the consultancy Activity, adds: “Try to use only a Wi-Fi provider that implements the IEEE standard 802.1x …What this basically means is that the provider’s client software automatically checks the network’s authenticity so a user cannot accidentally connect to an evil twin.”What steps should an organisation take to protect itself and its mobile employees? For a start, Prof Schmidt of the ISF emphasises that a wireless network connected to an enterprise network is not necessarily protected by the enterprise firewall. If an employee buys an off-the-shelf wireless connection, there may be no security at all.Mr Cotton of NCC Group makes four points. “First, do not believe any security vendors’ claims. Certainly, invest in security equipment, but have it tested by an independent expert. Second, don’t believe there is a silver bullet that will meet your security challenge. You must regularly review your arrangements. And if it’s cheap and easy to implement, it will not be secure. That’s just a rule of life.“Third, security policies must be in place and users must be aware of their responsibilities. Do not, for example, allow staff to use personal features on your wireless network. Fourth, keep up to date with the latest technical developments and advances in encryption.”Mr Cotton says the responsibility for observing these conditions lies with the chief executive: “A CEO has to know about security in this day and age.”*active eavesdropping where the attacker persuades the victims they are communicating over a secure connection.**a network allowing a virtual private network user to connect to the internet and a local network simultaneously over the same physical connection."
313;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-06-14T21:12:11Z;Focus on image excises a fondness for tax havens;;A change of address often sends a message. For the handful of multinationals leaving offshore tax centres, the message is that they do not want to be associated with them, however reputable they may be.When Accenture, the consulting group, announced plans last month to move its domicile from Bermuda (pictured above) to Dublin, the company said fears of a US government crackdown that could lead to higher taxes and compromise its ability to win public sector contracts, were among the reasons. Its regulatory statement said: “Continued criticism of and negative publicity regarding companies that are incorporated in countries that do not have tax treaties with the US, including Bermuda, could adversely affect us.”Such moves are a sign of how far tax has become a reputational issue for big business. “This perception thing is becoming more and more important,” says Patrick Stevens, a tax partner at Ernst & Young, the professional services firm. “There are a lot of business people who are hugely more bothered about it than they were 12 months ago.”The election of US President Barack Obama, who has repeatedly slammed the widespread use of tax havens by US businesses as “the biggest tax scam in the world”, has had a powerful influence on perceptions.So too have the negative headlines about bonuses and corporate malfeasance associated with the credit crunch, which have made many companies more sensitive about their image.The recession has also stiffened the resolve of tax authorities. Pravin Gordhan, South Africa’s finance minister, recently described aggressive avoidance as a “cancer”, saying corporate social responsibility was taking on “a new meaning”.“If we want governments to take on the role of guarantor of last resort, which is what they have done, they require the fiscal capability to be able to do so,” he said.Even within the business world, there is a view that some companies have been overstepping the mark. Chris Spooner, a senior executive at HSBC, has long criticised the artificial approach to tax adopted by some companies, particularly in banking. “It doesn’t make sense,” he says. “It’s a red rag to a bull [for the tax authorities] and it ruins the world for the rest of us.”One response from governments is to foster a climate of self-restraint. Reuven Avi-Yonah, an international tax specialist at the University of Michigan, says cultural attitudes towards tax are hugely important in securing voluntary compliance. “The US is far more successful in collecting the taxes due than countries like Italy …which do not see a patriotic duty in paying taxes,” he says.More generally, corporate attitudes to tax have shifted in line with broader business trends. Until the 1990s, companies saw paying taxes as part of their “general responsibility to society”. But that changed, says Prof Avi-Yonah, as “shareholder profit maximisation [became] the sole legitimate goal of corporate activity”.One obvious problem of aggressive tax avoidance, he adds, is that governments are left with insufficient revenues to spend on the infrastructure that businesses need. Another consequence is that it creates a higher risk of challenge by revenue authorities, as well as a general souring of the relationship between business and government.Public disapproval is also important, particularly for household brands. This factor may be growing in importance as some pressure groups, politicians and unions are spoiling for a fight over tax avoidance. Tax, they argue, should be at the heart of the social contract between business and the rest of society.Still, according to Judith Freedman of the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation, a moral climate is only part of the answer. She advocates using a legal concept, “a general anti-avoidance rule” to tackle the issue.“There is a subtle change in the way companies are concerned about reputation,” she says, “but I am not sure it will solve the problem.“Of course, companies should pay their fair share of tax. But there is no other norm to set that level other than the law.”
314;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-06-09T00:02:23Z;Insurance leaders eye emerging markets;;Executives at the world’s leading insurance companies are optimistic about growth at their companies, both through acquisition and organically, in spite of the pain inflicted on the industry by the turmoil in financial markets.International expansion is high on the agenda of many companies, particularly into the big emerging markets – Brazil, Russia, India and China – and Asia generally, according to two global survey due to be released this week.According to a survey of insurance executives from 49 countries by KPMG and the Economist Intelligence Unit, 55 per cent expect an improvement in organic growth, while 53 per cent expect to grow through acquisition or take-over during the next 12 months.Meanwhile, a survey of 104 companies worldwide by Accenture found that three-quarters think the current economic and financial turmoil will offer more opportunities to grow outside of their home market in the next three years.The responses are a contrast to the beleaguered performance of insurers in both stock and bond markets since the financial crisis struck. Investors have worried about insurers’ capital strength and the potential for waves of rights issues in the wake of the global financial crisis.The government bail-out of AIG in the US and the injection of public money into ING and Fortis in the Netherlands have helped to drive concerns that insurers were under threat of suffering a similar fate to the banking industry.However, outside of the US at least, many companies in both the life insurance and general insurance sectors have seen their stock prices begin to recover as equity markets have recovered in the past couple of months.Frank Ellenbuerger, head of KPMG’s Global Insurance practice, said that insurers were proving more resilient to the financial crisis than other areas of the financial services industry.“The insurance industry has not been so deeply affected by current economic conditions and so executives within it are perhaps more optimistic about their prospects for the coming year than those in other financial services sectors,” he said. “However, executives do still foresee a continuing lack of confidence in the capital markets as stifling to their recovery.”Serge Callet, global managing director of Accenture’s insurance practice, said that this crisis would differ from past ones because while some insurers might still be able to invest and move ahead of the pack, the slower growth in mature markets, lower margins and new financial services industry landscape would make expansion into developing markets more important.“Given the strategic importance of profitable international expansion, insurers will drive and prioritise investment on this business opportunity.”
315;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-05-27T18:41:23Z;When rebranding can come back to haunt you;;To some, Santander’s decision to rebrand Abbey and its other UK retail banking operations under a single banner marks yet another regrettable example of global businesses squeezing out local differences.To others, the move is just good business by the Spanish banking group as at least one of the brands – Bradford & Bingley – is fatally stymied by failure and government rescue.Aviva is another financial services operator which is currently spending millions advertising its original Norwich Union brand out of existence.Mergers, takeovers, disasters and transformations in the nature of business all provide justification for corporate rebranding. The rebirth of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan in 1997 under the Diageo banner and BTR Siebe as Invensys in 1999 are examples.But companies introducing or extending their brands do so at their peril.Abbey itself, then under Luqman Arnold, chief executive, was forced into an embarrassing U-turn over the pastel-coloured, lower-case livery of its identity when it dropped the “National” from its name in a £11m rebranding in 2003. It soon reverted to a branding style close the Abbey National original.British Airways also found itself at the centre of controversy when as part of a £60m rebranding in the 1990s it ditched its Union Flag tail-fins in favour of a range of multicultural designs which it was eventually forced to abandon.Most embarrassing, perhaps, was the case of Royal Mail, which under the leadership of John Roberts followed the trend of adopting a Latinate name, Consignia, to distance its post office service from its old-fashioned, public sector roots.Mr Roberts explained that Consignia described “the full scope of what the Post Office does in a way that the words ‘post’ and ‘office’ cannot”. Within two years, the name was gone.But Latinate names such as Aviva are thought to work well in being understood and recognisable in globalised markets, and have also been adopted by companies such as Andersen Consulting which renamed itself Accenture in 2001.At least Accenture did not suffer the ridicule heaped upon PwC when its consultancy arm was briefly rebranded Monday – to signify the excitement of the weekly return to work.And the subsequent demise of its former namesake Arthur Andersen in the wake of the Enron scandal made the name change particularly fortuitous.Coca-Cola was also hit by a consumer backlash in 1985 when it rebranded its main cola line simply as “New Coke” – but was forced to retreat within months.In spite of consumer complaints, some great British brands have been consigned to the marketing dustbin of history. Marathon and Opal Fruits now sell under their global names of Snickers and Starburst.The imposition of a Spanish name on 25m UK banking customers may well pass without too much comment. But Mitsubishi found itself embarrassed when it introduced its “Pajero” – or Pampas cat – SUV model in the 1980s.The name, a pejorative term in some Spanish-speaking countries, forced Mitsubishi to rebrand the car – known as the Shogun in UK – as the Montero in Spain and Latin America.

317;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-05-21T19:46:33Z;ACS pulls off an exceptional Aim fundraising;;UK investors are often cautious when software companies get involved with the National Health Service, but Thursday was a notable exception for Advanced Computer Software.In just two days the group pulled off one of the largest secondary fundraisings on Aim this year, raising £43m after brokers Seymour Pierce and Mirabaud Securities placed 145m shares at 30p. The 20 per cent discount to Thursday night’s closing price will take Advanced’s market capitalisation to £113m.The group had intended to raise £30m, but was offered £65m. BlackRock Asset Management and M&G were among the blue-chip fund managers to participate.Reticence towards healthcare software stems from the government’s national programme for IT. Its £12.4bn price tag has far exceeded original estimates, and there are questions over whether it will ever be fully delivered, and most contractors chosen to work on it – from BT, Accenture, Fujitsu and Isoft – have taken varying degrees of bruising.Advanced’s exceptionalism, and the reason behind its 65 per cent share price rise to 36½p in the past three months, has been put down to one person – Vin Murria, chief executive. She is a figure well known for her irrepressible enthusiasm, no-nonsense style and impressive record.The best-known example came two years ago at the height of the private equity market boom when she netted her investors a 10-fold return through the sale of Computer Software Group to HG Capital for 150p a share. Just four weeks later HG merged its new £91m acquisition with Iris Software and sold the entity to Hellman and Friedman for £500m.Advanced is her latest project, formed when Drury Lane Capital, a cash shell, bought Adastra for £12.2m in a reverse takeover in July.But rather than take on the troubled national programme, it is focused on the primary care market, which deals with non-emergency work such as walk-in polyclinics. Although it attracts fewer headlines, it accounts for 80 per cent of the NHS’s budget. And unlike the national programme, it is run by software that has existed for years and works.Unifying the market would help in creating a national, anonymous, network of medical data and summary care records for the Department of Health that the national programme has struggled to deliver.“Why are we trying to reinvent the wheel?” Ms Murria asks. “We have a great opportunity to do something for the NHS and save it a lot of money, if they knew how to do it. They don’t realise what is available,” she says.Thursday’s £43m fundraising gives Advanced a total of £55m for acquisitions, a central theme of Ms Murria’s 23-year career. On average, she has racked up more than one a year at Computer Software and as the former European chief operating officer at Kewill Systems, the logistics software group.Privately-owned Emis, which controls more than 50 per cent of the software for GPs’ surgeries, is often linked with a bid.Ian Spence, director of IS Research, points out that the software market is littered with acquisition vehicles that looked compelling in formative years but got bogged down by poor integration and organic growth.He also points out one factor beyond management control. “While the government is making the right noises about maintaining investment in technology that enhances efficiency, the reality is that the impact of government spending cuts after 2011 is as yet unknown.”
318;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Work that ERP, work it...;;When it comes to usage and adoption of enterprise systems – those packaged business applications used to manage an organisation’s critical resources – companies in the UK say they have a long way to go.A recent Accenture study revealed that 76 per cent of the UK and North American senior IT professionals surveyed believe that enterprise systems contribute to their organisation’s competitive advantage and provide strategic value.However, there are significant discrepancies between those in the UK and North America. Only 27 per cent of UK respondents “strongly agree” with the above statement compared to 43 per cent in North America.So, what’s behind this?Part of the challenge is that people take a traditional view of ERP and see such systems as monolithic and inflexible. Organisations need to understand that more mature and agile software exists today – enabling companies not only to manage core business processes but actively distinguish themselves from competitors.Examples include sharpening sales programmes to find new revenue or adapting logistics processes to squeeze costs out. Looking at the use of modern technology, service oriented architectures are leading to improved interaction with suppliers, partners and customers and helping organisations to get more bang for their ERP buck in the process through the power of automation.Understanding the opportunity is especially important in the challenging macro-economic environment of today. For those organisations that have been expanding their systems and making strategic investments by honing the business processes they support, now is the time to work those investments even harder.Senior IT professionals report their organisations only use 64 per cent of their enterprise systems core functions – so what can they do to make the other third that’s being left on the table work for them? Or to remedy a situation where 37 per cent of UK firms and 27 per cent North American firms have little or no data sharing with their customers?Core ideas include:1. Read between the lines. Organisations can extract and analyse the data they already have to provide critical insight around new opportunities, controlling risks and gain a tighter view over operations.Many examples exist of companies that failed to make use of data available to them. In the London housing market, there were signs – had they been read – that clearly pointed to an untenable bubble building, brought on by too many dwellings being built for too few buyers at the right income level.Reading between the lines is as much about organisational discipline and intellectual horsepower as it is about technology tools. It is also not a huge incremental investment relative to the cost of a system’s initial implementation. In a landscape that has become littered with the carcasses of many companies that failed to read the signs properly, it can make a huge difference.2. Remember the “P” in ERP. Up to now, businesses focused their resources on getting their system backbones in place to support core business functions. This is no modest accomplishment.In many cases, companies implemented ERP as an infrastructure spend for Y2K or to comply with regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley and more recently green-related legislation.Now is the time for companies to return their focus to the P for Planning in their ERP systems. This P stands for better and more nimble planning in all areas of a business – from financials to product development.Today, the world moves fast, and while organisations need that core backbone, now is the opportunity to add other applications, such as business intelligence and logistics management, that will help the business continually fine-tune.3. Industrialise the approach to implementation. In the context of an ERP implementation, industralisation involves using highly repeatable, disciplined approaches to speed delivery, and drive better outcomes.It is important for all the obvious reasons – lowering costs, improving quality and so forth. But perhaps most important – it will help a CFO or CIO to sleep well at night knowing the project won’t pose undue risk to the company.This potential risk can become a major hurdle in furthering the ERP agenda, so an organisation needs to consider the “how” along with the “what” when making its business case. Apply repeatable processes and a core architecture that is robust and well-tested: as a result, value-added enhancements or bolt-ons can be implemented more productively with greater predictability and without adversely affecting the overall environment.4. Embrace flexibility. If the current economic crisis has taught us anything, it is about the importance of having the flexibility to respond quickly to changing market conditions.In configuring an ERP system, thousands of decisions must be made. Each one builds on itself, so changing or undoing one has a tremendous ripple affect throughout the system. For those companies that have their ERP system already in place, the options are to become more flexible with add-on packages or consider upgrades to optimise the core data structures.5. Obtain strong business sponsorship. Having a strong foundation business case, especially at times like this, not only allows an organisation to control “scope creep” – those small changes that cause the thousand paper cuts that can put a company millions of dollars over budget – but helps in selling the project at the onset, getting the business on board, and managing change in the organisation.No matter how good the ERP system is, the organisation will be in for a rough ride if it lacks the presence of strong business sponsorship to “inflict” the necessary changes on the users.As for the survey itself, probably the main reading is that UK executives, in fact, actually recognise the potential in ERP and have lower scores because they know too well what they are missing.Either way, there is certainly opportunity for organisations on both sides of the ocean to squeeze out far more value from their enterprise systems and stop leaving as much as a third of their investment on the table in a business climate where returns on invetsment are more important than ever.
319;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-05-13T15:17:34Z;What IT means to me: Key is to keep an open mind;;"On the one hand, Accenture is one of the world’s best-known technology consultancies, advising businesses and governments.On the other, it employs 186,000 people across 120 countries, which means its own IT operations have to be slick. What’s more, its internal user community is as well informed and demanding as they come.This presents a daily challenge for Frank Modruson, the company’s global CIO. But it is one he relishes and makes his job among the most interesting in IT.One advantage Mr Modruson has is that the vast majority of Accenture staff understand and value IT. But he also takes steps to ensure that IT and the business stay aligned.“It’s important to be engaged and connected with the business and speak their language and the language of business is ultimately finance,” he says. “Speaking in terms of service levels, uptime and bandwidth isn’t helpful. You need to put IT into business terms that the leadership can understand and relate to.”But IT’s image also depends on constantly delivering tools that the business can use, and good value. “It’s easy to improve the image of IT when you have improved capabilities and noticeably made life better or easier for the people you serve,” he says.“Next generation communication and collaboration technologies have the potential to transform how we work,” he says. “I just had a secure communication via IM [instant messaging] with four CIOs, from four companies, across two continents. As this capability becomes more pervasive, it will have a huge impact. It will change the way we work and alter how we think of ‘the office’.”But, Mr Modruson believes, it is also critical to keep looking forward, and to maintain a willingness to try new ideas. This also means thinking about how personal technology could be used in the workplace.“I’ve been in technology for so long that I have come to appreciate there is always something bigger and better to come,” he says. “I remember in the late 1970s, when I first used e-mail. I thought it was amazing. Today it has its place but it’s much less exciting. Texting and desktop voice and video are much more valuable to me.”Of course, all these things cost money. But any CIO struggling to reconcile a flat, or falling, budget with the demands of the business for more IT capabilities, can take heart, as Mr Modruson is adamant it can be done.“We now spend less on IT in dollar terms than we did in 2001, when the company was, according to most of the metrics, half the size it is now,” he says. “IT is much better – and easier to use.”It is also the lifeblood of most businesses, he says: “IT has two aspects: day-to-day operations and future investment. The goal should be to drive down operating costs so you free money to invest in new capabilities that take you to a new level. If you are average for your industry, you should be asking why you are not doing better.”For Mr Modruson, excellence means constantly seeking ways to improve IT processes, improve efficiency and drive out costs. But it also means assessing new technologies for their potential, not just in the IT department, but across Accenture’s consulting practices.Social networking and knowledge sharing technologies are as much on Mr Modruson’s agenda as more conventional IT infrastructure projects, such as software-as-a-service.The firm has developed its own YouTube-style video sharing website, and systems to collect information from Accenture’s large internal user base, using the ideas of mass collaboration and so-called “crowd sourcing”.The video site has proved popular, for example by allowing Accenture staff to “see” life in one of the firm’s overseas offices before visiting. Visual clues to office culture and even dress codes come over in the video clips in ways that no staff manual could ever convey.The crowd sourcing system reflects Accenture’s approach of “solving old problems, using new technology”. The system, which sits on Accenture’s intranet, tries to be an innovation “grapevine”.The idea is that, rather than tasking a few people to spend a lot of time working on a technology, a much larger group of users can devote a few minutes – typically fewer than five – to reviewing a project or commenting on an idea.It is at least partly based on techniques used by social networking sites such as Facebook and Digg. Letting users try applications before they are completely finished is a nod to Google’s methods.If Mr Modruson wants to poll a group of 3,000 senior Accenture managers, for example, the system allows that. Conventional research and testing techniques would be too expensive, too slow, or demand too much of the managers’ time.It helps that Accenture’s internal IT department uses a cloud computing model, in which its systems are based on the internet, allowing the firm to deploy applications quickly and at low cost.“We put new stuff out there for people to try,” Mr Modruson says. “We are constantly trying to bridge the gap between in­novation, and new applications.”Accenture also runs IT along strict business lines, with sections receiving mock invoices for the total cost of their applications. This allows the IT department to understand exactly how much an application costs the firm.“Our scheduling application was the third most expensive in Accenture,” recalls Mr Modruson. “But it was a big deal for us: matching people to opportunities is our bread and butter.”“But the thing was a pig; we had 60 servers devoted to it. It was a packaged application that used a lot of resources, and users still complained that it performed poorly.”When the human resources department wanted additional features, this prompted a re-think.As a result, Mr Modruson’s team took the unusual step of abandoning the off-the-shelf application, and writing a replacement in-house.“We wrote a simpler application, that costs half as much, and it paid for itself in less than a year; it is faster and easier to use,” he says.The key, he suggests, is to keep an open mind when it comes to IT architecture: some applications are best developed in-house, some bought, and some deployed through technologies such as an internal cloud."

321;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-03-17T23:13:26Z;Mittal steels himself over financing;;With the steel industry shrouded in gloom, Lakshmi Mittal is starting to consider options for what he might need to do to raise cash should “doomsday” scenarios for the sector become reality.Should the slide in market conditions continue, the chairman and controlling shareholder in ArcelorMittal might need to raise several billion pounds by the end of the year to bolster the company’s balance sheet and reduce the risks of a breach in banking covenants.ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, said on Tuesday that it had no need to raise cash now and that it had a “successful debt-reduction programme in place” that was on course to bring down net debt of $26.5bn at the end of December by $4bn by the end of 2009.But the company said it was continuing to “consider all [potential fundraising] options as is only prudent”.A month ago, Mr Mittal said he thought the first quarter would probably mark “the bottom of the market” for the steel sector, with a small pick-up in demand later in the year.But John Lichtenstein, head of the metals industry group at Accenture, the consulting company, said he thought the year-on-year drop in global steel demand in 2009 could be as much as 14 per cent, as against his projection at the end of last year that the fall would be 10 per cent.A warning on Tuesday by Nucor, one of the two biggest US steelmakers, that it would probably make a loss in the first quarter, added to the sense of gloom.Jeffrey Largey, an analyst at JPMorgan, and one of the most pessimistic industry observers, thinks demand for steel this year could fall by a fifth.In a paper sent to clients last week, Mr Largey spelled out the implications of this kind of fall in demand for ArcelorMittal, of which Mr Mittal owns 45 per cent.Not only would steel shipments fail to climb much from the depressed level of the first quarter, but prices would also stay low. Mr Mittal is relying on a pick-up in prices to boost operating profits.Mr Largey’s worst case scenario is that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would be $6.1bn for 2009, as against his most likely projection of $8.5bn. Last year’s ebitda was $24.5bn. If earnings went this low, ArcelorMittal could be “at risk of breaching its financial covenant [over repayment of debts]” even assuming its debt reduction programme goes as planned, Mr Largey wrote.One banker close to the company said: “All the signs are that Mr Mittal and his advisers are looking at the various options they could take to raise up to several billion dollars to bring down debts more than they plan at present, should conditions in the steel industry fail to improve.”One potential option might be a rights issue that could raise between $3bn-$5bn. Another could be to sell at least one of the company’s steel plants which might raise a similar sum, although it is highly unlikely to want to sell some of its crown jewels – such as its factory in Vitoria, Brazil.Another alternative might be to sell a strategic stake in the company to an outside business, such as a Chinese state-owned steel company. ArcelorMittal on Tuesday strenuously denied it was contemplating such a step.A deal of this sort, assuming Mr Mittal sold a stake of 5-10 per cent, could raise up to $2.5bn.Beijing might find this a tantalising possibility, given China’s wish to play a bigger part in the world steel industry. But it is highly unlikely that Mr Mittal would wish to entertain such a radical step.But with the steel industry set to go through a slide that six months ago would have seemed impossible, there is an increasing sense that all bets are on.
322;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-02-24T22:25:12Z;Five: 15, Oran Mór, Glasgow;;The student cleaner dreams of the future while dusting an old couple’s home. She sees them as decrepit – but no sooner has she chanced on their macabre past than she becomes their latest victim. Poignant, farcical and grotesque, Stuart MacRae’s Remembrance Day is a masterpiece in embryo, full of moods and murmurs and post-Bergian mosaics. It is one of two runaway successes at Five:15, an evening of short operas pairing established writers and composers. Alex Reedijk, Scottish Opera’s general director, introduced the format a year ago to keep the cash-strapped company’s creative juices flowing. This is the acceptable face of modern opera – short, popular, entertaining, experimental. It puts composers and librettists on the spot: they have to grab their audience, create an atmosphere, be concise not indulgent.MacRae, Scotland’s leading younger-generation composer, has learnt a lot since his less-than- convincing debut, The Assassin Tree, in 2006. In Louise Welsh he has found a librettist whose imagination is as practical as it is theatrical. Around her words he weaves a music of shimmers and shadows, economical and expressive. What’s so remarkable about Remembrance Day is that you’re not aware of technique or the passing of time. Reedijk should offer them a full-length commission, and get Accenture, Five:15 sponsor, to fund it.The other hit is Death of a Scientist, a fantasy on the emotional conflict that led to the suicide of David Kelly, the UK weapons inspector revealed as the source of a controversial BBC report on the use of intelligence before the Iraq war. With a scenario (music by John Harris, words by Zinnie Harris) that pits the protagonist between two sirens of death on one hand and the voice of logic on the other, it has lyrical personality and operatic clout.Two works are little more than student efforts, as if the creative teams have made no effort to study opera’s peculiarities. A third – White, a parable of isolation and loss – incorporates some good ideas, notably a chorus of medics, but Margaret McCartney’s scenario has insufficient flesh to compensate for Gareth Williams’s derivative score.At The Hub, Edinburgh on Saturday and Sunday, tel +44 131 473 2015
323;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-02-14T03:33:46Z;Mobile devices a luxury no more;;"The growth of mobile broadband is transforming the kind of content that can be offered to consumers on a handset. But there is still work to do to convince the mass market.Social networking, music downloads and mapping applications were services that, just two years ago, either were not possible on a mobile or were hugely expensive. – both to the content providers and users. “We can now do it very cost effectively,” says Rich Holdsworth, the chief technology officer of optimisation specialists, Wapple.The media industry is keen to seize this opportunity for enhanced mobile content, and this is resulting in what Olaf Swantee, the head of Orange’s global mobile operations, describes as an “explosion” of content designed specifically for the mobile internet.Gaming companies, for example, are developing rich-media games that allow users to link with each other on the move bringing functionality on a par with devices linked to a PC or television. “Handsets can now offer a connected experience, much more like a gaming console,” says Barry Cottle, chief executive of EA Mobile, a division of the gaming company Electronic Arts.This new supply of content is starting to find consumers. Since Apple launched its iPhone App Store – a site with dedicated iPhone applications covering categories from entertainment to finance and social networking – in May 2008, it has had 500m downloads and has generated $120m in revenues, according to publisher Informa.Jin Lee, managing director for the communications and high technology group at consultancy Accenture, points out that Apple went from offering 500 applications to 10,000 in less than six months. “That’s all happening during the downturn,” he says. “This indicates consumers are relying more on their mobile phones as a needed device rather than a luxury, even now.”It is not just the “iPhone” effect, says Mr Swantee at Orange: content consumption using dongles [gadgets that control wireless access] attached to laptops, as well as other handsets, has also been on the rise. He points out that in Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe, usage on its mobile broadband network is as high as in the rest of Orange’s footprint in Europe. “We are seeing the same average revenue per user there as we are in our other markets,” he says. “Mobile broadband is taking off in every country, whether it is a highly developed or underdeveloped market.”Yet even with faster networks and better devices, the industry is scrambling to keep up with the changes underway on the fixed internet, which is also becoming a richer experience.Only a couple of years ago, the size of an average web page was 100 kilobytes; today it’s 350KB. “That trend will not change. Things are only getting more sophisticated,” says Randy Cavaiani, vice president, marketing and business development for Novarra, which, like Wapple, optimises the internet for mobiles. “Functions such as RSS feeds and viral tools work well on the laptop, but the challenge is delivering all that over the limited functionality of a handset.”Indeed, most phones still lack some of the most common applications used for streaming video and audio on the internet, such as Flash from Adobe, which appears on most websites, but cannot be read by the majority of devices on the market. Danny Winokur, senior director of business development in the platform business unit at Adobe says the company’s mobile version of the application, Flash Lite, is starting to see widespread adoption on handsets but he added that full Flash has had “limited success”. He says the company is developing a full Flash version that will work on handsets “by the end of this year”.The mobile world also remains highly complex: a popular destination on the mobile web can attract up to 50,000 unique combinations of phones and browsers, which means formatting content 50,000 different ways to make it user-friendly, says Mr Cavaiani at Novarra.“The challenge continues to be fragmentation,” says Mr Cottle at EA. “Everyone believed that we would consolidate on a single platform but today we have even more handsets, platforms, and capabilities.”For now, says Mitch Lazar, managing director in Europe for Connected Life, Yahoo’s mobile and broadband service, the focus will have to be on mobile-specific content, or “using your mobile to get show times and cinema locations rather than the movie itself”.He says: “The priority now is for publishers to think about mobile first experiences. It’s not about taking the PC and shoving it into the phone. It’s about how best to develop the real estate and the experience to engage the audience.”"
324;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Siemens issues ban on external advisers;;Siemens, Europe’s largest engineering group, has underlined the challenge facing management consultants in the recession by ordering a ban on their use in a move it hopes will save it about €300m ($386m).Peter Löscher, the German group’s chief executive, wrote to managers at the end of last month to say that all contracts with external consultants have to be phased out quickly.The lightbulbs-to-power stations conglomerate will only use its in-house SMC consultants in future.Any exceptions to this will need the approval of Mr Löscher or Siemens’ chief financial officer, and the consultants will need to show that the economic benefit of their work will exceed their costs and that it will fall in this business year.Siemens hopes to save a “middle three-digit million euro sum”, the letter says, through the cancellation of hundreds of contracts, with the likes of McKinsey and Accenture, as part of a larger cost-cutting drive.The move is a sign of how many large companies are looking to scale back their use of management consultants. “News like Siemens’ is our worst nightmare,” said a senior executive at a big international consultancy. “If more big firms did that we would be in a lot of trouble.”Other European groups are similarly reviewing their use of management consultants. An executive at a large industrial group outside Germany said: “Paying consultants is naturally one of the first things that we review and we are trimming already. Maybe it will be slashing soon.”A German carmaker said: “Any non-essential projects are being canned right now and that definitely includes consultants.”Consultant contracts had already been under review at Siemens.Sham consultant contracts were at the heart of a multi-billion euro bribery scandal and were used to conceal suspicious payments.That scandal saw Siemens’ former chief executive and ex-chairman resign and the group pay more than $1bn in fines.But Siemens said the ban on external consultants had nothing to do with the scandal and instead fitted with Mr Löscher’s drive to cut €1.2bn from administrative costs by 2010.Siemens historically earns about half as much per employee as its US rival General Electric.By cutting jobs, work by consultants and improving efficiency, Mr Löscher is hoping to reduce overheads by 10 per cent by 2010 in a move investors have welcomed, but questioned as being ambitious.
325;ACN;Accenture Plc;2009-01-26T00:04:00Z;Warmth wins over a reluctant consultant;;When Carlos Loewenstein decided to study for an MBA at Insead, his rationale was simple: he no longer wanted to work for Accenture as a financial services consultant. He had grown tired of his job and the constant travelling was taking its toll.He wanted to change career and work and live outside his home country of Venezuela – ideally in Spain or London.He was unsure what he would do. “My strengths were working in finance, but I was not keen on investment banking. However I had not ruled out industry.”Within a few weeks of beginning his MBA, exactly a year ago, competition for summer internships at investment banks began. Initially not interested, he started to hear the phrases Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs more often. “You knew [joining an investment bank] that you were going to get a good salary.”Students around him, who had never previously shown any interest in investment banking, started applying for internships. Although tempted, Mr Loewenstein rejected the idea and decided to focus on industry and applied for related internships. He was lucky and was offered one in the oil and gas industry with BP.Despite thoroughly enjoying his placement and subsequently being offered both a job and a Helios fellowship with BP, Mr Loewenstein realised the job was not for him.“I didn’t like it, it was a very slow-paced industry.”So he continued to look for something else. But over the summer the recruitment market had changed.“It was very, very difficult, not to say impossible.”Many companies he says, were only recruiting for one or two positions and those students who secured interviews had previous experience in that sector. He thought it was time to change tack.Still reluctant to look for jobs in Latin America, he decided to play to his strengths and reconsider consultancy. He applied to the big names and went through to almost the last stage of interviews at them all.Then, from out of the blue, he received a call for an interview with Samsung’s Global Strategy Group – an incubation centre for high-calibre global managers at one of Asia’s most profitable business groups.At the time, recalls Mr Loewenstein, he was not very keen, but decided to go ahead.However after the first interview, Mr Loewenstein found his indifference fading.“The whole interaction was really good, they were very sincere and the job started to sound interesting.” This had not been his experience with other companies, whose bargaining power was bigger. These companies he says, while not being rude, were rather cold.After successfully negotiating the first round of the interview process, he was contacted by Insead alumni already at Samsung. By the time of his second and third interviews, he was primed about what the job would entail, which included time working and living in Korea.All five Insead students who received a Samsung offer accepted and Mr Loewenstein and his wife will move to Korea in March.Of his peers at Insead, Mr Loewenstein says there has been a shift in perception.“It is funny how people were killing themselves for banking jobs and now they are killing themselves for industry jobs.”Mr Loewenstein himself acknowledges with a certain wry amusement that he has not ended up quite where he thought he would.“I was not expecting to work in Asia …and I was not expecting to go back to consulting. The funny part is that Samsung is the second-biggest credit card issuer in Asia and I am in financial services consulting in Korea.”“It is going to be an interesting ride.”
326;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;BT faces NHS contract charge;;When BT Group warned last week that it could take another charge on profits of “hundreds of millions of pounds” against two big contracts, it was understood that one of them was the National Health Service’s deeply troubled IT programme to create an electronic record of 50m patients.BT holds three big deals worth more than £2bn for the complex programme that is running at least four years late, according to the National Audit Office.Two of these, from BT’s point of view, have gone well. One, to provide a broadband network linking NHS organisations, was completed early. By March last year, according to the NAO, BT had booked revenues of £423m four years into a seven-year contract worth £530m at 2004 prices.A second, to deliver the “spine” that holds the national summary record, while providing a host of messaging, demographic and security applications, saw BT earn £585m up to last March on a deal worth £889m at 2004-05 prices.But, like the other big suppliers to the NHS project – CSC, Accenture and Fujitsu, the last two of which have had their contracts terminated – BT has struggled to install the new patient administration systems and the software needed for the patient record, particularly in big acute hospitals.BT has a £1.08bn-plus contract to do that in London. Smaller installations in, for example, community hospitals have gone reasonably well. But, five years in, just four new systems have been put into the capital’s 31 big acute hospitals, and all have been plagued by serious problems.The contracts state that suppliers do not get paid until systems have been working to the user’s satisfaction for 45 days.While that has protected the taxpayer, it has hit the companies hard. According to the NAO, expenditure for the whole programme had reached just £1.9bn last March against planned spending of £3.4bn – 44 per cent less than expected.According to health department figures, more than four years into BT’s £1bn 10-year London deal, it had earned just £191m up to last March.Since then, BT’s revenues have been hit again by a decision to halt any further deployments to the 27 other big hospitals in London until the existing problems have been fully resolved.BT is also negotiating a change that will give hospitals a more tailored service than the “one size fits all” approach that has characterised the programme so far. That, however, will cost more, according to insiders and it appears that as yet there is no agreement over who will pay for that – the programme or BT.Finally, the health department says BT is also in “advanced discussions” on taking over eight deployments originally installed by Fujitsu in the south of England, before it was fired from the programme. That would represent additional work.A health department plan on the way forward, originally promised for late last year, now looks unlikely to appear before late February or early March.Only then might the full effect on BT of its engagement with the NHS start to become clearer.
327;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Far from the boardroom;;When John Eder, an MBA student at Kenan-Flagler Business School in the US, was on a summer internship in Ethiopia giving business training to women with HIV/Aids, he discovered something surprising.“Some of the women have been selling stuff in the local market for a long time,” he says. “And they’d sit there and talk about principles I learned from my classes. Things my professors had been telling me, they would be telling me – and they never went to any college or had any business training.”Mr Eder, who was working with the Society of International Missionaries in Addis Ababa, plans to start a business. However, rather than gaining experience through a summer internship at an investment bank or management consultancy, Mr Eder decided to work in a developing country with a non-profit organisation supporting entrepreneurs.He is not alone. As the appetite among MBA students for courses that address social and environmental problems grows, many are using their summer internship to gain experience in these areas by working with non-profits, non-governmental organisations, or social entrepreneurs.“There’s a huge appetite for this,” says Gib Bulloch, director of Accenture Development Partnerships, an arm of Accenture that provides services to non-profit groups in developing countries. “You have the international experience that people crave and the emerging markets experience that’s increasingly important to the whole sustainability agenda.”While assignments at ADP are mainly taken up by Accenture employees who wish to spend time working in an emerging market, the company has in recent years also offered the assignments as internships for undergraduates and MBA students. Students have worked with organisations such as Unicef in New Delhi, the Global Food Banking Network in South Africa and Women’s World Banking in New York.For some individuals, the choice of this type of internship may be a prelude to a career in the non-profit sector. However, for others, such as Mr Eder, such experience is seen as highly relevant to a career in the business world.“These are MBAs who have offers from McKinsey, Bain and Deloitte,” says Elmira Bayrasli, head of partnership policy and outreach at Endeavor, a US-based non-profit that identifies and supports entrepreneurs in countries such as Argentina, Mexico, Uruguay, India, Egypt and Jordan.“But they’d like to have an experience working with a real entrepreneur in an emerging market.”Through what it calls its eMBA programme, Endeavor selects students from top business schools in the US to spend 10 weeks working with some of the entrepreneurs on its programme. Recruits come from Harvard, Stanford, Wharton and Columbia business schools. Endeavor is expanding the programme to other schools such as Thunderbird, Chicago and MIT Sloan.“A lot of the students are going for the first time to these developing economies,” says Ms Bayrasli. “And they’re not just learning about the economy – they’re learning about the culture and the people. Those are things that don’t come into a business school classroom.”While students working with non-profits or entrepreneurs are gaining knowledge of new markets and ways of doing business, the learning process is two-way. Such organisations recognise that MBA interns provide valuable services to non-profits and social entrepreneurs.As a result, savvy non-profit organisations have established fellowships or summer programmes that attract MBAs looking for an alternative internship.Among the first to do so was Ashoka, the pioneering social entrepreneurship non-profit organisation. Last year, Ashoka’s MBA interns worked with small businesses in housing, health, energy, banking and agribusiness on 10-week assignments in Brazil and Mexico.In addition to giving non-profits or social entrepreneurs access to the business skills of MBA students, some of the organisations offering these kinds of internships have found the programmes bring other benefits too.At ADP, the internship programme also gives the company a competitive edge when it comes to recruiting talent. “They come back highly motivated and with new skills, but they also tell their whole campus about a different side to Accenture – and they tend to accept job offers,” says Mr Bulloch.For MBAs, the internships give the opportunity to gain international experience in a very different business context from any they may have encountered at home.Amy Lin, a Wharton MBA student who spent a summer in the Kenya office of Acumen Fund, which invests in and supports developing country entrepreneurs, found one of the biggest adjustments was working in a resource-stretched environment.“The East Africa office is really small, with only two full-time people and there’s a lot to be done, so there was a lot of sharing work.”Working without access to the kind of infrastructure and technology taken for granted in mature markets was also a challenge.However, much of what the MBA students have learned in their first year proves highly relevant to their summer assignments.“Sometimes when you’re a student, you can lose track of real world applications and this threw me into it right away,” says Ms Lin.“I had to look at financial models, evaluate whether I believed their assumptions, pick apart a balance sheet and make sure that it fitted with the business model.”And some of the more intangible lessons MBA students have learned during their time in the developing world have proved extremely powerful. Mr Eder was deeply impressed by the perseverance of the women he was working with – women who, even with access to retroviral drugs, could only count on a limited lifespan.“They [the women] faced something I had thought was insurmountable but they were just going to keep going. And that’s really healthy for someone who’s going to be an entrepreneur. It’s not a direct business principle, but for me it’s very important for what I’m going to be doing.”
328;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Skills learnt the Italian way;;"Government spending cuts are throw-ing Italian schools and universities into turmoil, sparking campus sit-ins and mass street protests around the country. The education system is in crisis, its brain-drain and lows in world rankings matched by its teachers’ pitiful salaries.“These are tough times,” says Gianluca Spina, professor of management and dean of MIP, the Politechnico di Milano school of management.MIP’s governance structure, unique in Italy, gives it some shelter in the storm, however. Founded in 1979, it is 51 per cent owned by Milan’s Politechnico, Italy’s oldest and largest state technical university, and 49 per cent by 17 corporations, mainly Italian multinationals, as well as subsidiaries of foreign enterprises, including Taiwan’s Acer and Accenture of the UK.MIP was born out of the desire of industrialists at Pirelli, Eni and Fiat to provide their engineers with management skills. And, as Italy is drawn into the mainstream of globalisation, MIP is supplying customised business management packages for its corporate shareholders, as well as the open market.“We are helping Italian companies with globalisation, how to manage cultural diversity as they acquire companies abroad, make greenfield investments and open factories, how to forge a corporate identity,” says Prof Spina.He gives the example of the corporate MBA programme developed for Italcementi, Europe’s second largest cement group which is expanding in the US, Asia and the Middle East. Non-Italians make up 25 of the class of 30.Known as a country of small enterprises and family-run businesses, Italy has relatively few companies on the list of Fortune 500 in spite of its status as a G8 country. But MIP has found its own niche there, by educating foreign customers on how small companies perform.“US and China want to know about Italy’s small companies, industrial districts and fashion houses,” Prof Spina says, noting its training programme on the exhibition and convention industry run with Shanghai’s JiaoTong University.About half of MIP’s 600 to 700 students are individuals rather than on corporate programmes, drawn by Milan’s reputation as a hub for design, fashion, finance and football. Among the wide-ranging courses on offer is a post-graduate course for athletes and young managers in the business of sport.A full-time MBA course over 14 months costs €25,000, while an executive MBA spread over two years is €28,000. Of the 75 students taking the full-time MBA, 50 are non-Italian. The institute has recently received accreditation from Equis, the accrediting arm of the European Foundation for Management Development.Prof Spina sees three types of non-corporate students. The first is the non-Italian seeking a life experience – learning Italian, having a clear idea to return home and find work there. Type two are students from emerging economies – Chinese, Indian and Latin American – who see a full-time MBA as a gateway to the developed world, expecting to find a placement in Italy or Europe. The third is more international career- oriented, seeking good placements but not necessarily in Europe.Anthony Lambkin, an Australian, is clear “type three” material. After graduating from Brisbane University, he moved on to the University of North Carolina in the US and then the car industry in Detroit.He says he was attracted by Politechnico’s reputation for technological innovation, an MBA course that is shorter and more intense than in the US, and the inclusion of an internship, which he will complete at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, working on clean technology start-ups.“Milan feels like a hub,” he smiles.From the start of the next academic year in May, MIP is moving with a large part of Politechnico out of its cramped and functional quarters in the suburbs of Milan. A campus for 20,000 students is being built in a former industrial zone outside the city in Boviso.Prof Spina notes that Politechnico di Milano, with 40,000 students, provides 50 per cent of Italy’s designers, 25 per cent of its architects and 15 per cent of its engineers. It is a powerful brand that enables MIP to compete with its more established and better known rival, Bocconi, a private university also in Milan.Unicredit, Italy’s second largest bank, which is also a member of the shareholders’ consortium, took the un­usual step of “forcing” the two rival schools to co-
operate and integrate programmes for its executives. “They threatened to go to Insead or London Business School instead,” Prof Spina recalls.As the international debate continues over the role that the MBA “culture” has played in the global financial crisis, there are some wry smiles from around the table in recalling the MIP programmes that assisted UniCredit’s move into Germany and central and eastern Europe – an expansion that prompted the bank to seek a €6.6bn recapitalisation last October, and which was followed by official Libyan funds taking a 5 per cent stake in the bank."
329;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-12-28T17:36:30Z;Shocked steelmakers brace themselves for another tough year;;The suddenness of the fall in steel demand in recent months has left many of the industry’s bosses in a state of shock and there are few obvious signs that the outlook is going to get better in the immediate future.Global steel production could easily plunge by 10 per cent or more next year, with China leading the slump in output.But although the industry is in its worst state since steel prices hit rock bottom towards the end of 2001, some industry observers believe there are a few bright spots on the horizon.John Lichtenstein, head of the metals industry group at Accenture, the consulting company, thinks the next few years need not be unremittingly grim.“The speed and decisiveness of the cutbacks in production [by big steelmakers] have been unprecedented, which means profitability in this downturn for the steel industry is likely to hold up better than in other comparable periods,” Mr Lichtenstein says.By controlling supply better than in previous downturns, steel companies should be in a better position to keep prices at fairly high levels – and so guard against too steep a fall in earnings, he believes.Backing up this argument is research from Meps, a UK-based steel consultancy, which expects average prices of all steel grades sold worldwide to climb marginally over the next few months, rather than continue the steep falls that started in July.According to Meps, average steel prices should rise to $750 a tonne by next July, from a low point of $676 a tonne seen earlier this month.Even though the price has fallen precipitously from $1,160 a tonne in July 2008, today’s steel price is still considerably above the low point of $275 a tonne seen in November 2001, which was the last time the sector was in a state of slump.Rod Beddows, chief executive of Hatch Corporate Finance, a financial group specialising in the metals industry, does not attempt to downplay the difficult period for the sector.He reckons the steel business should be bracing itself for a “sharp” downturn “with a period of four years between the sector returning to the level of output and demand it experienced in the first half of 2008”.Matthias Hellstern, who monitors the European steel industry on behalf of Moody’s, the credit ratings agency, is slightly more gloomy.He says that any upturn that comes later in 2009, perhaps around the second or third quarters, will be “extremely mild”.Mr Hellstern reckons there is a chance that global steel production will fail to return to the levels of the first half of 2008 until 2013.On the assumption that steel production in 2008 will be slightly lower than the 1.34bn tonnes recorded in 2007, it could, according to Mr Hellstern’s calculations, be more than five years before annual output sector climbs again to this level.According to data from the London-based Iron and Steel Statistics Bureau, an industry research body, there have been only four occasions since 1900, apart from periods of world wars, when the global steel sector has taken four years or longer to climb out of a downturn by attaining the previous high point in production.The most protracted slump on record for the sector – aside from the war years – was the nine-year period from 1979.However, not all analysts are quite as downbeat as Mr Hellstern.Peter Marcus, managing partner at World Steel Dynamics, a US consultancy, believes that output could rebound by 12.9 per cent in 2010, following a fall of 13.9 per cent in 2009, which would mean annual output returning to the level of 2007 in 2011.Whatever happens to steel output in 2009 and 2010, virtually everyone agrees that the coming year will be a fairly miserable one for most steelmakers.It will be a stark contrast to the stellar period from 2001 to around the middle of this year, when steel companies’ share prices and profits soared.
330;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-12-15T19:13:05Z;HCL to use Axon deal to target Europe;;One of India’s most ambitious technology companies will use its £440m acquisition of the UK’s Axon Group to target customers of a host of European IT services groups by undercutting them on price.Vineet Nayar, chief executive of HCL Technologies, told the Financial Times he would use the deal for Axon, which was completed on Monday, to grab market share from European rivals such as UK-based Deloitte and Logica, and France’s Cap Gemini in the market to integrate SAP software.SAP software, which forms the basis for many corporate IT systems, is among the world’s most widely used business programmes. However, for every dollar companies spend on SAP software, systems integrators that install it charge up to $5.Although the market for SAP-related services is $23bn (£15bn) annually, companies are looking to cut IT costs. HCL will offer free SAP upgrades if customers use its India-based computing systems remote management.The deal for Axon will catapult HCL, considered one of India’s second-tier IT systems integrators, into competition with Accenture and IBM.Mr Nayar said HCL would guarantee 20 per cent reduction in costs, which would then be reinvested in further migration of IT services. “The first thing is identification of unhappy customers elsewhere and make them happy customers.” he said.He declined to specify which markets HCL Axon would focus on, but the telecommunications, utilities and financial services markets are candidates.“In effect, Axon has reversed merged with HCL,” he said. “It is being kept separate from the rest of the business, with a separate identity and culture.”The move comes as HCL warned that growth in the quarter would be hit by a slowdown in client spending. HCL has secured $1bn in new orders this quarter, excluding a contribution from Axon, compared with $270m the previous quarter.Mr Nayar described the European market as “very attractive”. He said: “The UK is a stepping stone and markets such as France, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands are growing at a colossal rate.”Mr Nayar’s comments also highlight Indian companies’ growing ambitions. The Axon deal was the largest overseas to date by an Indian technology company but it sparked a bidding war with domestic rival Infosys in a country where contested acquisitions are rare.HCL also bought the life and pensions operation from Liberata in July, and Mr Nayar said he was looking for more acquisitions.

332;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-12-07T22:51:05Z;US companies launch ethical standards push;;"Some of the largest companies in the US, including General Electric, Wal-Mart and PepsiCo, were expected on Monday to launch a drive to improve ethical standards in business in an attempt to stem the decline in corporate America’s public standing.The move by 17 companies, with nearly $1,000bn in sales, to commit to key principles of good business conduct comes as the financial crisis and recession are fuelling a political and public backlash against the corporate world.The huge problems faced by companies, such as banks and carmakers, that are run by highly paid executives have exacerbated anger among ordinary Americans who have seen their living standards deteriorate due to the economic slowdown.“In these challenging economic times, it is important that the public have confidence in all of business and not just select companies. We take this very seriously,” said Larry Thompson, PepsiCo’s general counsel and a former deputy US attorney-general.Under the agreement, from the Ethisphere Institute, companies will sign up to four principles of ethical behaviour: legal compliance, including not paying bribes; transparency; avoiding conflict of interests and increasing accountability.The organisers admit that the initiative, called the Business Ethics Leadership Alliance, is partly driven by companies’ desire to burnish ethical credentials and curry favour with Barack Obama’s Democratic administration.But although the principles are vague and most companies should be able to comply with them, the 17 signatories, which also include United Airlines, Dell and Accenture, have agreed to periodic examinations by independent auditors.The founding members have also pledged to try to get other companies to join.Gary Hill, chief ethics officer at Wal-Mart, said the retail group would encourage its huge supplier base to sign up to the principles.Mr Hill said that unethical behaviour was on the rise in corporate America, reversing a trend sparked by the regulatory clean-up that followed the Enron collapse.Some of the companies involved in the pact have faced their own ethical challenges. In 2006, Sempra Energy agreed to pay more than $377m to settle accusations that it manipulated natural gas prices during the 2001 California energy crisis. Sempra could not be reached. In 2005, Wal-Mart paid $11m to the Department of Justice to settle an investigation into the use of illegal immigrants by cleaning contractors at its US stores.Three employees of CACI International, the defence services company, were cited in a 2004 report by the Pentagon into the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.CACI could not be reached but said at the time: “Nothing in the…report can be construed as CACI employees directing, participating in or even observing” the abuses."
333;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-12-02T15:58:31Z;Mobile e-mail: popular but not yet ubiquitous;;"Mobile e-mail may play less of a role in Barack Obama’s life when he becomes US president in January – reports suggest he will have to give up the BlackBerry that became his most visible accessory on the campaign trail.But in this, he will be bucking the trend: while mobile operators and content companies have struggled to drive traffic for most other mobile data services, mobile e-mail has grown hugely in the past eight years.David Heit, director of enterprise product management for mobile e-mail pioneer Research In Motion, which makes the BlackBerry, says it took six years to get to the first million BlackBerry users, but then only six months to reach the second million. Now there are around 19m people using BlackBerry devices, with tens of millions more accessing e-mail wirelessly using smartphones from Nokia, Apple and Windows mobile manufacturers, as well as a range of other feature phones.“E-mail is far and away the biggest data success for us,” says Alex Windle, head of e-mail and applications at Vodafone UK. “After e-mail …well, there isn’t any big horizontal application doing as well.”Now e-mail appears to be at a tipping point. A survey by AppTrigger, an application connectivity specialist, indicates that, for all its popularity, mobile e-mail is not yet ubiquitous. One-third of people surveyed in the US and Canada never use mobile e-mail for personal use and 45 per cent never use mobile e-mail for business either. Only 24 per cent of those responding considered mobile e-mail an essential feature on their phones.“If you look back even a few years, it was once very hard to get Hotmail on the phone,” says Stuart Orr, a partner in the technology practice at Accenture. “Now people have the ability to take their fixed accounts to mobile quite easily.”In spite of advances in ease of use from handset makers, mobile e-mail still has its shortcomings. Mr Heit at RIM says manufacturers have to wrestle with contradictions: “People say, ‘I want a big screen, but please make the device as small as possible’.” Simon Devonshire, head of SME marketing at O2, says only a third of the businesses accessing its wireless data services in the UK use handsets for e-mail; the rest use data cards with laptops.At the same time, the industry is keen to capitalise on mobile e-mail’s successes. Some are trying to integrate e-mail functionality into other applications.Device makers have made it easier for other applications, such as instant messaging and social networking sites, automatically to work with a user’s e-mail contacts list. “I collaborate with other people, so the mobile device has to do the same thing,” says Mr Heit.One device has moved e-mail to its most central position yet: in the Android phone system, developed by Google, the handset will not work without the user first logging into a Gmail e-mail account.Others are trying to pin mobile e-mail on to the rising cloud of “Software as a Service”. The majority of businesses may want to retain control of the security of their e-mail systems by hosting it on site, but “for many companies, it’s cheaper to take a hosted service than to run it themselves”, says Andy Lees, senior vice-president of Microsoft’s Mobile Communications Business.He claims hosted Microsoft Exchange for mobile handsets has been generating a lot of interest, particularly among smaller businesses.But not everyone is positive about mobile e-mail: some businesses want it removed from devices.The facilities management company GSH bought several hundred BlackBerrys for its workforce in 2003 because they offered a “robust communications platform” to deliver its proprietary software, says Maxwell Segal, GSH’s IT director.“But what happened was that our guys started to use e-mail on the devices,” he says. E-mail led to “messaging mates”, which led to looking up football scores and playing solitaire. “It was a distraction to have all those facilities,” says Mr Segal. “We now lock down the e-mail function.”Mr Windle says Vodafone has recently been asked to disable the e-mail function on BlackBerry devices for corporate clients. The idea is to save money by managing only one kind of device; or where mobile e-mail is not essential to the business.In future, enterprise users in developed countries may not be the target audience for mobile e-mail services. Richard Warmsley, head of internet at T-Mobile, says the biggest growth of mobile e-mail usage on his network, over the past couple of years, has been in the consumer sector.Others believe the biggest opportunity will be among lower-income segments in the developing world. This is where mobile use is growing fastest: Pyramid Research predicts 85 per cent of the next billion mobile users will come from regions such as Africa and South America, while fixed broadband and PC penetration will remain low.In the developing world, operators are taking a different approach to tariffs. “One model that works particularly well has been a flat rate exclusively for mobile e-mail services that includes data transmission,” says Carsten Brinkschulte, chief exective of Synchronica, a mobile e-mail vendor.He says the charge works out at around $3 per month for the service. The company has recently signed deals with operators in Africa and MTS in Russia.Mr Orr at Accenture says the developing world is behind the west by about 18 months in terms of the infrastructure for wide-scale mobile e-mail services. “But clearly it will be an absolutely huge market,” he says.“E-mail, once you have it, is a very sticky service.”"
334;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-11-11T01:43:30Z;Charity begins in the office;;TechnoServe received a $2.9m grant from Microsoft last August. The grant was not a donation towards one of the non-profit’s programmes, which equip entrepreneurs in the developing world to establish businesses that create jobs and reduce poverty.It was for an information technology upgrade, allowing the organisation to standardise IT tools across its offices worldwide.However, for many non-profits, this kind of grant remains an elusive dream. Too often, funding comes with strings attached – strings limiting the spending to programme work rather than on support functions such as staff training, improved IT systems or HR management.“Funding that is targeted to programmes almost exclusively, with minimal overhead allowances, remains a major problem,” says Raj Kumar, president and co-founder of the Development Executive Group, which provides business intelligence and recruiting services to the development community.Yet, as many in the sector point out, boosting operational efficiency by investing in technical training, HR management or streamlined procurement systems not only helps organisations work more effectively but can also mean more cash for mission-driven activities.As a result of working with IBM on a shared procurement system, for example, the Georgia Center for Nonprofits, which helps organisations make better use of their resources, found charities could cut procurement costs by up to 30 per cent. By standardising processes, they could cut associated administrative costs in half.And for a charity that, say, delivers emergency relief supplies, investments in training for logisticians would be money well spent because it could help the organisation deliver those supplies faster.What makes it hard to attract money for such initiatives is that employee training, IT systems and office efficiency measures are invisible and do not provide the kind of images that appeal to donors and cannot be easily turned into compelling stories that link to alleviating poverty, improving access to healthcare or saving a portion of rainforest.Moreover, individual donors are often unaware of the importance of back office operations. “There’s a naivety in thinking that their £10 floats magically across the world and turns itself into food that goes in the mouth of a starving person,” says Gib Bulloch, director of Accenture Development Partnerships, part of the Accenture consulting and technology services group that provides services to non-governmental organisations and non-profits in developing countries.“They don’t understand the fact that investing in people, technology and systems may actually have more impact on poverty, health and education than this race to the bottom on overheads,” says Mr Bulloch.The focus on overheads as an efficiency measure troubles many in the non-profit sector. In the absence of hard measures, counting spending on overheads has been raised to a prominence seen as unhelpful. “It’s one of the few quantitative and universally comparable measures so it gets a lot of attention,” says William Foster, a partner at Bridgespan, a non-profit spin-off of consultants Bain & Co that offers services to foundations and non-profits. “It’s not what people aspire to as an end goal but, because it’s so measurable, it’s given outsized attention.”A symptom of this, according to Mr Kumar, is that non-profits are starting to bid for government contracts from agencies such as USAID – contracts that were once the preserve of private sector companies but now attract non-profits as they provide funding for overhead investments.Another, less positive, effect of funding restrictions is that organisations may mask overheads as project costs in their accounting. When Bridgespan, in a report*, calculated the cost of doing business for four organisations and compared that with the overhead spending those organisations reported, it found that while they stated rates of 13 to 22 per cent, actual rates ranged from 17 to 35 per cent.Interviewees complained about funder expectations. “Donors often ask me about our administrative costs,” said one finance director. “It seems that they always want to make sure that we’re under 20 per cent. I always end up launching into my spiel about the importance of effective administration. It’s so frustrating!”The finance director’s frustration reflects a bigger problem – the fact that donors’ focus on low overheads prevents organisations from becoming more efficient. “It constrains non-profits from investing in forward-thinking initiatives, such as IT, developing new funding streams, and strategic planning, because all of these require overheads,” Mr Kumar says.There is, of course, another side to the story: the ability of non-profits to improve their accountability and measurement of the impact of their programmes – something that might encourage donors to relax their scrutiny of overhead expenditure.Paul Shoemaker, director of Social Venture Partners Seattle, a network of donors that partner with non-profit organisations, believes that in this respect the funding issue is “a two-way street”.“People ask whether, if you want less restricted funding and more flexibility, [non-profits] become unaccountable – and the answer is absolutely not,” he says. “Accountability in any sector is a good thing. We’ve just created the wrong kind of accountability mechanisms in the non-profit sector.”Mr Shoemaker believes donors must become more flexible and effective in their funding practices, while non-profits need to do a better job of demonstrating and communicating the impact of their activities.Some examples of this type of relationship exist. The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, which helps low-income young people gain access to services and programmes that will improve their lives, has strict demands for accountability from its grantees. The foundation makes funds available for things such as leadership development, with grants for executive coaching and search, succession planning and board development and recruiting.“They are well known for giving larger than normal grants over multi-year periods of time that are unrestricted,” says Mr Foster. “Which is exactly what non-profits need to build long-term organisational strength that creates impact.”And TechnoServe will certainly feel the impact of this kind of grant making. With Microsoft’s money, it will integrate throughout its operations Microsoft Office and other applications and operating systems such as Exchange, SQL Server, SharePoint and Outlook.“As we grow, we need to upgrade IT and recruitment systems,” says Bruce McNamer, chief executive of TechnoServe. “Because we need to run our organisation in an efficient way.”Chances are, the new systems will not appear in photographs in glossy brochures or annual reports. But TechnoServe’s enhanced efficiency will ultimately have an impact, allowing it to support more developing country entrepreneurs as they build businesses, generate incomes and improve prospects for their families and their communities.* Nonprofit Overhead Costs: Breaking the Vicious Cycle of Misleading Reporting, Bridgespan Group, April 2008
335;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
336;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Connecting with customers through online content;;To serve customers as well as you can – and attract new ones wherever possible – it is essential to stand back and look at all the ways you interact with the outside world.As the first touch point for new customers, a company website is one of, if not the most important channel to market. To stand out in an increasingly competitive marketplace, channel businesses need to introduce a wide variety of features to their websites to improve their customers’ shopping experience. But what does a more interactive and interesting website really mean for the e-tailer?The development of a multi-channel marketplace is having a big impact on the retail market. Customers can now balance their purchasing habits between the online and the offline world. They are becoming more demanding as they strive for convenience and better value online. The multi-channel service offering provides customers with the flexibility they have come to expect.With 70 per cent of consumers searching for product information online before making a purchase (according to Accenture, 2007), shop assistants are no longer regarded as fashion experts or authorities on hi-tech cameras and plasma televisions. Consumers are more informed than ever, turning to the net for the latest reference or review of a product. As retailers increasingly adopt next-generation e-commerce functionality, it becomes ever more important for online retailers to market their products in more compelling ways.Retailers can now display their full range of products online and not suffer the confines of limited shelf space. They can also use “scarcity” tactics – by putting products into limited edition categories or restricting the availability to online, giving the impression they are in short supply.As the market matures, customer expectations are changing. Now customer service needs to be addressed in the form of usability, a good returns policy, geographical awareness and how the website is presented. Retailers need to have all the technology in place, ensuring a tight and efficient supply chain while providing consumers an all-round multi-channel experience.A company website needs to be informative, attractive and capture the essence of the business. But, website development and the distribution and delivery of content can evolve quickly. In order to remain competitive, retail companies must be flexible and use technologies that meet the present and future needs of the business.The systems used to build these websites need to deliver all types of content – web, mobile, video, print, audio, PDFs and images – quickly and easily. Retail content managers therefore need to do more than just edit pages. The right data model, tools and interface, will support the management and publishing of “content rich objects” to ensure a positive customer experience every time.Companies also need to analyse data effectively to ensure they are responsive to changing customer needs, while using information to help develop and build customer interest. Only when they have done this, will they be able to gain business confidence, attract new business and meet the challenges of an uncertain economy.
337;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-11-04T16:17:33Z;Personal view: How the Millennial Generation connects;;E-mail is so 1998. IM-ing, texting, Twittering? Now we’re talking – or to be more specific, that’s how the next-generation workforce is talking.As the “Millennials” establish themselves in the workplace, they are by-passing the conventional enterprise technology tools thrust upon them, including e-mail. Instead, they are relying on a host of new collaboration tools – many not sanctioned by corporate IT.Those attitudes emerge loudly and clearly in new Accenture research examining how young people think about and work with information technology. The findings demonstrate how important it is for CIOs to recognise – and accommodate – the technology expectations of Millennial workers.The survey queried more than 400 US students and employees across three Millennial age groups – 14-17, 18-22 and 23-27. The results show an increasing demand among this generation for high-tech devices to connect with colleagues, peers, friends and family. Importantly, the findings point to a disconnect between the technology that organisations provide for their workers and the ways in which young employees collaborate in private life and want to collaborate in the workplace.In nearly every category of workplace technology, more than 20 per cent of the respondents who use employer-provided technologies said those technologies did not meet their expectations. In many cases, Millennials are relying on unsupported technology to do their jobs. When asked about the tools they use for work-related activities, 31 per cent said they use a mobile phone or smart device that is not sanctioned by IT, 23 per cent said they use unsupported social networking sites, and 20 per cent said they use unapproved instant messaging (IM) tools.And while e-mail remains a consuming reality in the workplace – the older “twentysomethings” in our survey said they spend the better part of 10 hours a week writing or receiving work-related e-mails – the preference for younger Millennials clearly is toward texting, instant messaging and social networking sites such as Facebook. The CIO of a leading US bank reported that her new employees “communicate by Facebook and simply will not read their e-mail”.“For today’s teenagers, e-mail is the equivalent of a written letter – they use it only for formal communication,” says Jerrold Grochow, vice-president of information services and technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “To them, e-mail is for old people.”The back-door invasion of instant messaging, iPods, social networking and other consumer-oriented tools into organisations around the world is giving many CIOs the cold sweats over privacy, security and other issues. But it also presents a hidden opportunity, because these tools might allow all workers – not just the Millennials – to collaborate more effectively across their organisation.Embracing a new generation of collaboration tools offers potentially significant benefits to any business. Providing more flexibility to workers in how they communicate with colleagues – and with customers or clients – can lead to more effective collaboration, quicker decision-making, and improved productivity. For example, according to research from Aberdeen Group, companies that show “best-of-class” capabilities in workforce collaboration – including the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies – achieved a 34 per cent average reduction in the time needed to complete projects.Companies are finding that many emerging technologies favoured by Millennials are simply better than e-mail and other legacy enterprise applications for communicating quickly and efficiently.At Procter & Gamble, for example, an internal social network modelled closely on YouTube is proving effective for communicating complex programme initiatives and for better connecting large, geographically dispersed teams.“We see enterprise social networking as the ability to declare affinity with colleagues. We’re getting some good traction and adoption,” says Joe Schueller, IT innovation section leader with P&G.Other consumer-oriented collaboration methods are proving equally beneficial in enterprises. Members of a team at a multinational had been sending as many as 150 e-mails a day discussing their project while never being certain of involving the right people. When they moved the discussion to a blog, their e-mail inboxes emptied, and the key team members joined in as needed. “When you open up the community and define its focus, you almost guarantee that you have the right people,” explained the company’s CIO.At MIT, some professors are using online chat rooms for “virtual office hours” to answer questions from students. The university uses text messaging to broadcast announcements to students and faculty, and is also experimenting with ways to make certain databases, such as course catalogues, more accessible.The message for CIOs is twofold. First, adopting consumer-based technologies – especially those that enable collaboration – is no longer optional. These technologies are already in your company and in use. Second (and beyond the clear concerns for data security, privacy and stability), your company’s competitiveness may well depend on adopting, integrating and supporting these technologies.“CIOs should not assume that technologies that made people more productive five or 10 years ago will make the incoming group more productive,” says Mr Grochow. “They need to determine what the productivity tools are for the next generation of workers.”Smart CIOs understand this and are working with teams of Millennial employees to find solutions that exploit their collaboration power without putting the enterprise at risk. Other CIOs may find that their replacements will do so.Gary Curtis is managing director of Accenture Technology Consulting. He also serves as Accenture’s chief technology strategist
338;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-11-04T16:17:33Z;IT role models: Anticipating needs of users is fulfilling;;Marion Mesnage is a strong proponent of the credo that technology is for everyone: male or female, young or old, rich or poor.Now a senior researcher at Accenture Technology Labs in Sophia Antipolis, a technology park near Antibes in the south of France, she was the only woman in her team in the early part of her career. Today, it is far more diverse, and half the team are women.Gender balance, she says, is vital to propagating the ideas and prototypes that Accenture will develop into innovative products.“Similar people, working together, tend to come up with similar ideas,” she argues. “You need a wide range of kinds of people working on a team to really stimulate true creativity and innovation.”Equally important, she adds, women are involved in shaping the information society that future generations will inhabit.“As technology increasingly shapes every aspect of our lives and our societies, it’s important that everyone has a hand in its creation and that everyone benefits from it.”Digital inclusion has been a strong theme in Ms Mesnage’s work at Accenture. An early project, for example, experimented with the idea of using a network of cameras and sensors to monitor elderly people living alone, detecting events such as a fall and, if necessary, alerting the emergency services.At a time when demographic trends point to an increasingly ageing population in the advanced world, this sort of technology would enable many more people to retain their independence as they aged.Currently, Ms Mesnage is focusing her expertise on another pressing subject: climate change. Along with two colleagues, she is investigating how intelligent sensors might be embedded into devices and vehicles to monitor their energy consumption and create data relating to energy costs and carbon emissions.“When I first started thinking about this subject a few years ago, it seemed really far-fetched. I constantly had to remind people that climate change was a very real issue. These days, there’s no doubt in anyone’s mind, so we’ve been able to move on to the next question: what can we do about it?”IT, she is convinced, has a huge role to play in the race to develop energy and carbon management products and she plans to spend “at least the next year to two years” exploring this area.That’s the most fulfilling part of her work, she says – identifying the next wave of technology and anticipating the needs of users.This kind of work, she adds, demands “stubbornness and optimism”, because, inevitability, any technologist’s blue-sky research tends to attract detractors. “Luckily, I have both those qualities,” she jokes.But the work she does is also deeply anchored in the reality of today’s businesses, so she spends a lot of time visiting CIOs, hearing about the challenges their organisations are facing.Understandably, there is no end to the number of visitors to the Sophia Antipolis campus, which sits in pine-scented foothills within easy reach of Riviera hotspots, such as Nice and Cannes.Born and educated in Paris, Ms Mesnage studied engineering at the city’s École Polytechnique and moved on to postgraduate studies in image processing, pattern recognition and robotics at the École de Techniques Avancées.But the advent of the dot-com boom and the opportunity of an internship at geospatial mapping start-up Istar took her to the Riviera, where she has remained.“I was ready to leave Paris and see other places,” she says. Eight years on, she is the mother of two children, aged six and one, and feels “very lucky” that Accenture’s flexible working policies allow her to work four days out of five.“The rest of the time is for my children, for my family. I describe myself as a mother, a wife and an IT professional. All three roles are extremely important to me.”
339;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-11-04T16:17:31Z;New skills: good, bad – or both?;;"It is mysterious how a little fine wine and top class cuisine can help scattered ideas marshal themselves into a coherent single thought.At a recent informal dinner debate, hosted by Symantec, the initial question concerned the skills of the generation of youngsters now entering, or about to enter, the workplace. Having grown up in the age of computers, the internet and broadband, would they be good or bad for business?After the usual brief silence, I heard myself saying: “Both.”Perhaps it was the way the question was put, but it suddenly seemed obvious that the generation now being dubbed “the Millennials” are growing into fabulous users of technology but are hopeless at creating or developing it. They are becoming great drivers, but know less and less of what takes place in the engine compartment.Schools, colleges and universities complain of a lack of interest in computer science, while youngsters seem to equate IT skills with managing music and video files and social networking.So the latter are the skills that will predominantly find their way into the workplace and possibly bring about deep-seated changes in the way businesses operate, which could be for the good. Meanwhile, the programming and engineering skills needed both to identify opportunities and implement ideas seem to be drying up, at least wherever populations are heavily computerised. Which must be bad.Two related articles in this issue address this sharp divergence in skill-sets. Gary Curtis of Accenture examines how enterprises are being affected by the IT tools preferred by younger workers; and Geoff Nairn writes about the urgent need to get more students learning about mainframes, which are still vital to business – but which to most youngsters will be a mystery."
340;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-09-09T20:58:59Z;Speed key to keeping loyalty;;The LSE will need to act quickly to retain the loyalty of its customers and their confidence in its much-vaunted high-speed trading platform, TradElect.The system was built for the LSE by Accenture to provide “exceptional reliability” and “world-class performance”, according to a promotional video for the system.The LSE was certainly expecting world-class performance when it installed TradElect in June 2007. The platform runs on Hewlett-Packard hardware and the technology behind it was developed using Microsoft’s C# programming language and .net Framework.TradElect was designed to cut trade processing times from 110 milliseconds to just 6 milliseconds — 30 times faster than the blink of an eye — and to allow thousands of messages a second to speed through the wires.The system was updated last October. Each upgrade was intended to provide ever-speedier service and to allow more high-speed computer generated, or “algorithmic”, trading.The platform was also built to be reliable: back-up provision for the system includes dual processing at two sites and recovery from component failure within a second, according to TradElect documentation.However, the LSE says the nature of the connectivity issues, which prevented clients from placing orders, were such that switching to a back-up system would not have solved the problem.The exchange said it had introduced a fix and was confident another failure would not happen.
341;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Indian outsourcers aim for value;;Visitors to Satyam Computer Services’ new “automotive and aerospace centre of excellence” – or AACE – could be forgiven for believing they had entered a space shuttle rather than the office of an Indian outsourcing company.The entrance to the research laboratory in the southern city of Chennai is through a semi-circular passageway, lit with blue lights. Just inside the doorway, movement detectors play different notes of music as the visitor passes through them. Around the laboratory, technicians tinker with robots simulating industrial production processes.Some of this is for show. But the purpose of the laboratory, which can design cars and the factories to produce them entirely on computer, is very clear. As India’s outsourcing companies try to grab more market share from their global information technology peers, they are seeking to differentiate themselves by moving further up the value chain.“Now customers are not necessarily coming to us to save costs but more for value,” said Subu Subramanian, Satyam director and senior vice-president of the manufacturing and automotive solutions business unit.India’s outsourcers started life as “body shops” – providers of programmers or call centre workers at a fraction of the cost of those in developed markets who could perform simple functions on the part of clients.But with labour costs and competition rising, India’s outsourcing companies are increasingly seeking to compete directly with their peers at the large global IT consultancies, such as IBM or Accenture. The aim is to get access to the client’s boardroom – to become an advisor to the customer on business-related issues, not just an IT project manager.This trend was highlighted this week by potentially the industry’s largest ever offshore acquisition. Infosys Technologies, the number two software services provider in India, made an agreed bid for the Axon Group of £407m ($747m).The acquisition of the UK-based company, which specialises in providing consulting services around the products of German software maker SAP, would double Infosys’ capabilities in this fast-growing area.Wipro, the number three firm in the industry, last year staged the Indian software sector’s second-biggest overseas acquisition, taking over Infocrossing of the US, a computer “infrastructure” management firm.The trend is to generate higher margins from the same number of employees. This is being driven by the economic slowdown in the US, which has weakened demand for Indian outsourcing services.“Firms are tightening costs with smaller salary hikes and radically cutting recruitment,” said Aniruddha Dange, analyst at India Infoline, a Mumbai-based brokerage.One of the fastest growing new areas for Indian companies is engineering services outsourcing, the sort of offering that Satyam is proposing at its laboratory in Chennai.Crisil Research, a unit of the Indian affiliate of Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, predicts that engineering services outsourcing will grow from $2.4bn in total sales as of March this year to $7.5bn by March 2013 – a compound annual growth rate of 26 per cent. India’s share of this business will rise to 25 per cent from 19 per cent, it said.“The Indian ESO industry will evolve from its current product portfolio and slowly but surely graduate to be the design services hub of the world,” the report said.Many Indian outsourcers are already offering some engineering services outsourcing. Vineet Nayyar, chief executive of Tech Mahindra, said the company is selling its telecoms clients security hardware and software products under its Ipolicy unit that remove spam from networks and prevent intrusions by hackers.Wipro, for its part, has developed technologies and chips for use in clients’ mobile phones. Satyam’s automotive and aerospace centre, however, might be one of the most ambitious attempts yet by an Indian firm to capture the engineering outsourcing market.The company’s automotive practice employs 7,000 people and claims to work for most of the top automotive producers and their suppliers. Rather than using physical mouldings to design a car, as remains a common practice today, for instance, this is all done online at AACE. Greenfield factories are computer designed, right down to the operations of the robots and the flow of paint to the spray cans.The idea is eventually to offer one-stop automotive design so that once the owner of a car brand name has done its market research and decided on the required features for a vehicle, it can hand over the entire process to the outsourcing house.“What the industry went through with information technology in terms of outsourcing 20 years ago, engineering is going through today,” said Mr Subramaniam.
342;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-07-27T22:29:33Z;India alert after two days of bombings;;Indian cities have been put on high alert after the second wave of serial bomb blasts to strike the country in two days killed at least 45 people and injured more than 161 in the western city of Ahmedabad.The series of at least 16 small bombs, which mostly struck the old city of Ahmedabad, capital of India’s mercantile Gujarat state, on Saturday, came only a day after a similar wave of blasts left one person dead in Bangalore, India’s Silicon Valley.Police said they found two more unexploded bombs on Sunday in Surat, which is also in Gujarat and is one of the world’s biggest diamond-polishing centres.“Anti-national elements have been trying to create panic among the people of our country,” India’s Home Minister, Shivraj Patil, said.The attacks will add to pressure on the Congress party-led ruling coalition to improve its record on security with only months to go before a general election.They will also alarm foreign investors. The world’s biggest technology companies, investment banks and global consultancy firms, from IBM to Goldman Sachs and Accenture, employ thousands of people in Bangalore and other cities.Across India on Sunday police went on alert, with security forces guarding Hindu temples in the eastern city of Kolkata and police in New Delhi warning citizens in crowded markets to watch for suspicious activity.“The entire nation, including major metro cities in India, have been put on high alert and they have been asked to step up security in vital installations,” the home ministry told Reuters.Indian media reported that a little-known group calling itself the Indian Mujahideen had claimed responsibility – the same group that said it was behind attacks in Jaipur, which killed 63 people in May.The first wave of bombings in Ahmedadad struck busy market places in the Muslim-dominated old quarter with many of the devices placed in tiffin boxes, used to carry food, and left on bicycles. The second wave occurred around a hospital about 20 minutes later, police said.The government, which normally blames Islamic militants backed by groups in Pakistan and Bangladesh for terrorist bombings in the country, was concerned the attacks could trigger clashes between India’s minority Muslim and dominant Hindu communities.Gujarat is led by chief minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu hardliner accused of turning a blind eye to anti-Muslim riots in the state in 2002.Mr Patil told reporters: “The most important thing today . . . is to see that the peace and tranquility in Gujarat is not disturbed or the peace and tranquility in any part of the country is not disturbed.”India has always been the target of terrorist attacks but their frequency and sophistication has increased during the past four years.The government’s record on solving such cases has been patchy at best. And while police claim to have foiled a number of terrorist plots in recent years, the number of attacks has continued to increase.The opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party has sought to paint the Congress-led government as soft on terrorism ahead of the forthcoming polls.
343;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-07-11T09:20:25Z;Balancing the freedom of the user may be the biggest challenge;;A year ago lthough some questioned whether this Web 2.0 “revolution” was really just a fad. A year on it’s clear that these technologies are here to stay.So where will Web 2.0 go next? It’s probable that it will expand from its social and recreational roots, and take its place in the business environment, where its potential collaborative and information-sharing benefits could help attract high calibre employees as well as drive revenues.Although, large firms such as HSBC and Accenture are making use of some features internally, overall enterprise take-up of Web 2.0 technologies has to date not been as enthusiastic as some expected. The primary reason is that no company wants to be the first to take the plunge and invest in technologies that are relatively unproven. Tagging and groups are all very well on Facebook, but no business wants to deploy them until they’ve proved to drive strong return on investment. With budgets tighter than ever in the current economic environment, this is no small concern.The key to success is knowing which Web 2.0 technologies to invest in and how to deploy them. True business value lies in achieving the right balance between addressing corporate needs innovatively and only investing in tools that will deliver good ROI. Managers need to ensure they identify their business challenges and match the right technological solution to each requirement. They then need to have a plan in place to ensure employee uptake of each new technology.Recent research by enterprise content management association AIIM showed that while almost half of businesses consider Web 2.0 as significantly important or essential to their overall success, 59 per cent see “lack of understanding or appreciation” by employees as a hindrance to take-up.It is user acceptance that ultimately defines the success of any Web 2.0 installation. If a solution is not used, it doesn’t matter how technologically innovative it is. So it must be easy for employees (and perhaps external partners as well) to pick up and use new features intuitively and quickly. Users who are familiar with Web 2.0 from their personal online activities will not necessarily feel comfortable using the same technologies in a business context without some guidance and assurance at a corporate level that they are as relevant and appropriate in the workplace as they are outside it. It is human nature to resist change, so even though a new piece of functionality may prove to make a task easier and more efficient, if it’s not the way employees are used to doing it, there will inevitably be some reluctance which needs to be overcome.Conversely, any workforce is likely to include a number of individuals that see themselves as technological pioneers and early adopters. These people are keen to leverage new technologies any way they can, and may even begin the introduction of Web 2.0 to the enterprise before corporate management does. As the ones ”on the ground”, doing the day-to-day work, they are often the first to spot where a new technology, such as social networking, could help make their job easier and more efficient.With the rise of software as a service (SaaS), it is also becoming easier for employees themselves to drive procurement cycles and the ways in which new technologies are used. Organisations planning to implement Web 2.0 features into their internal processes therefore need to ensure that a user strategy and guidelines are in place right from the start to make sure these early adopters remain within company policy while encouraging acceptance of new solutions among their peers.While taking care to provide employees with a framework for Web 2.0 practice that meets the needs of both types of worker, each organisation must not lose sight of or stifle one of the most important aspects of the Web 2.0 vision: that it is a user-controlled phenomenon. While management should certainly provide guidelines for use at the start, the extent to which this use is regulated over time should be carefully defined depending on the organisation. Balancing the freedom of the user to create, manage and share content that is associated with Web 2.0 with corporate requirements for cohesion, security and compliance may well be the biggest challenge for many businesses.While management may need to take a backseat when it comes to employees’ use of any new features, it still has a significant role to play in the overall Web 2.0 strategy and corporations should consider the wider, long-term business challenges that an internal Web 2.0 deployment can help tackle. Information generated and shared through wikis, blogs, communities and other new features will enable knowledge management and transfer across the entire user base, improving employee collaboration and productivity while positively impacting the business processes that it touches upon.In another year, it is likely that Web 2.0 will be playing a major role in business. It’s therefore essential that organisations act now to anticipate the challenges and position themselves favourably in order to maximise future success.Guy Westlake is senior product marketing manager for Vignette EMEA, a content management and web software business
344;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-07-01T17:20:21Z;Private equity pays dear for investment in chemicals;;When investors and bankers look to sectors being affected by the credit crunch, the chemical industry comes close to the top of the list.Analysts say storm clouds are gathering as a result of slowing GDP and increasing volatility in oil prices, which makes it difficult to pass on price rises to consumers in the short term.Jonathan Pitkanen, a credit analyst at Morley Fund Management, says: “We are finally at the top of the chemicals sector cycle and there has been limited to no deleveraging in the so-called good times for these companies to survive the downturn that is about to hit.”The past five years have seen many companies in the sector snapped up by private equity. In 2006, private equity groups accounted for about 50 per cent of global mergers and acquisitions volumes in chemicals, against 5 per cent in 2000.Their attraction was, ironically, their strong cash positions. But private equity’s commitment to investing in chemicals in the long run, say analysts, is now being put to the test as cash falls and the longer-term investments needed for a successful exit create an even higher drain on cash.Blackstone has in recent months had to roll up its sleeves to help improve the performance of its buy-out of German plastic film producer Klöckner Pentaplast.Private equity companies operating in the sector, say observers, are now more than ever focused on managing cash flow and addressing inventory.Andy Tinlin, UK head of corporate strategy at Accenture, says: “If we get much deeper into a recession in the US and private equity has to toss in 30 to 40 per cent of their original investment, they have some hard decisions to make. They may have to cut the strings on some deals which are not returning the required rate of capital over the next three to four years.”Over the past 10 years, the chemicals sector has seen a serious ramping up of leverage. The median credit rating in the European chemicals sector will have fallen from A- in 1999 to borderline junk by the end of this year, according to Standard & Poor’s.John Rogers, senior vice-president at Moody’s Investor Services, says: “The negative outlook on the chemicals industry is due to the substantial run up in petrochemical costs, energy costs and commodity prices as well as slowing growth in Europe and the US. Because of the raw material inflation some chemical companies are now cash flow negative, working capital needs are likely to absorb any free cash flow around. We are definitely seeing problems.”Industry observers say 2009 is likely to mark a cyclical downturn for petrochemical companies as substantial supply comes on stream – making the next 12 months onwards a pivotal time for the industry.Jonathan Tyler, director of chemical investment banking at Houlihan Lokey, says: “Some chemical companies have high debt multiples, they are very aggressively leveraged. Money was cheap and they piled it on.“But many of the listed companies were more risk-averse and had lower debt levels. I don’t expect to see a whole load of right issues. There may have to be some more aggressive restructuring”.Ineos Group, the UK’s biggest private company and one of the world’s biggest chemical producers, has been listed as one of the six most vulnerable companies in the sector, according to S&P.Last month Ineos, which is Europe’s biggest junk bond issuer, had its rating outlook downgraded by S&P on concerns over increased risks and profit pressures next year as well as tight covenant leeway.A spokesman for Ineos accepted the tough economic climate and outlook for 2009 but added that the group was “a diversified business and in good shape to work through the possible downturn in the cycle”.The chemical sector – both the commodities end and the speciality end – is also being hit hard on account of a limited ability to quickly pass on price increases.Commodity chemical businesses tend to be more sensitive to the impact of higher oil prices and are more used to volatility.But the industry has responded. Last month Dow Chemical raised the price of all of its products by up to 20 per cent.
345;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-06-23T17:25:11Z;Personal view online: The pros and cons of utility computing;;"Utility computing – or software-as-a-service, or countless other similar labels – was hotly debated in the first of Digital Business’s Personal View Online features.A succession of senior executives and prominent experts have been giving their views in their own words, resulting in a collection of 10 articles offering a range of opinions and advice, which can be read in full at www.ft.com/digitalbusiness/utilitycomputing.Views range from strong support for the software-as-a-service idea: “It looks as though utility computing has finally come of age” (Mike Irwin of Webroot), through to the cautious: “Corporate consumers of external services still have to overcome the twin challenges of trust and cost; trust that the website delivering the services will still be there tomorrow and the cost of survival if one of the key business processes disappears overnight” (Marc Davies of CSC).Among the more positive writers is Phill Robinson, chief executive of Velocix: “As larger organisations see how nimble and flexible those using utility computing can be, we will definitely see this era grow and develop.” And Jeremy Roche, chief executive of Coda, believes that when SaaS platforms become trusted, we could see an increasing proportion of the market move this way.The benefits of SaaS are succinctly stated by Mike Webb, chief executive of iHub: “With hosted services, all changes can be managed quickly and easily via a PC. Managers can point and click for system updates while sitting at their desks and avoid third-party reliance and the associated costs.”Kishore Swaminathan, chief scientist at Accenture, lists the advantages as: “Lower IT costs, faster deployment of new IT capabilities, an elastic IT infrastructure that can expand or contract as needed, and most importantly, a CIO freed from the more mundane aspects of managing the IT infrastructure.”Serguei Beloussov, chief executive of Parallels, explains why the Saas model could not have been deployed five years ago: “Service providers could not sweat their infrastructure hard enough for the SaaS model to make financial sense. This has changed with developments in virtualisation and automation technology.”The consultants are more circumspect. SaaS does not mark the end of IT departments, writes Bob Tarzey of Quocirca, but it is going to change how their job is done, with more time to focus on the high level business benefits of IT.One simple question needs to be asked by those responsible for IT spending in their organisation, according to Mike Reid of Sapient: “How much value do we gain by doing this in-house?”Alastair McAulay of PA Consulting argues that there are three steps.First, “recognise that within most organisations of more than 100 people there are unique business requirements where the IT involved does have to be tailored to individual circumstances”.Second, “acknowledge that there may well be cases where legacy information systems are working pretty well”.Third, “identify where there really are IT areas that can be sensibly commoditised and handed over to an IT utility service provider”.Read Mr McAulay’s conclusions and all these articles in full via the Digital Business home page – and if you are inspired to write your own contribution, then e-mail it to us at digitalbusiness@ft.com, where it can be considered for online publication.The second Personal View Online debate, on IT in Financial Services, is running from June 2 until Friday (June 20), with features by senior industry figures, which can also be viewed via the Digital Business home page. The third series of Personal View Online articles, on companies’ Web 2.0 strategies, begins on Monday June 23."
346;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-05-29T21:47:30Z;Relapse for IT records system;;Just when the National Health Service’s mighty and troubled £12.7bn programme to provide every patient in England with an electronic record looked as though it might be about to turn an important corner, it has skidded off the road again.The resulting accident is not yet terminal. But it does mean more dire headlines and it is hard to see how the news of Fujitsu’s departure from the Connecting for Health programme will not produce further delays to an electronic record that is already running more than four years late – even if some parts of the exercise, ironically, may speed up.The bad news that the programme has parted company with another big supplier – Accenture having walked away in 2006 – comes as things were finally looking up. BT appeared to be cracking the installation of the new systems in London, the part of the country for which it holds the local service provider contract. Preliminary installations that are critical to getting the electronic record to work have gone into most of London’s mental health trusts and two or three big acute hospitals – not without inevitable teething troubles, but without the sort of catastrophic disruption that hospitals in the south have at times seen as Fujitsu tried to do the same.In the north, iSoft’s long-delayed Lorenzo patient-record software is about to go into three pathfinder trusts this summer. If that had gone well, the programme would have felt itself to be back on track. Now it is plunged into further doubt and condemnation from opposition politicians who were demanding yet again a review.Fujitsu’s deal always looked questionable. It was the last, and in terms of scope, the biggest of the five regional installation contracts. It covered more than 12m people and 90 hospitals and NHS organisations. But Fujitsu’s agreed price for it was only £896m, nearly £200m less to cover 25 per cent of the population than Accenture got from the NHS for covering 15 per cent. It looked badly underpriced.A senior Fujitsu executive predicted that once one or two of the systems were in it would be “like shelling peas”. It proved anything but. Hospital after hospital suffered crashes and troubled installations as what was still an interim system, without the full record, went in. As of March, new systems had gone into just nine out of 41 acute hospitals and they were working so badly that Fujitsu had not been paid for more than half of them, according to the National Audit Office.Industry sources say both BT and Computer Services Corporation, which now holds the installation contract for almost everything north of London, have been more flexible about giving NHS trusts what they want, instead of insisting they have precisely what was specified in the original contract.Negotiations with Fujitsu are understood to have broken down not on the price the NHS was prepared to pay for a more flexible deal but on the timing of upfront payments that the company wanted. The NHS refused to depart from the principle that has kept the programme on budget to date – that it will not pay for services until they are delivered. One senior health department source said: “We have to protect the taxpayer.”In a letter to NHS trusts, Gordon Hextall, the programme’s chief operating officer, said Fujitsu would support existing live sites and the industry expectation is that they will complete one or two that are about to go live in order to get paid.Beyond that, rather than a complete takeover of Fujitsu’s contract by one provider, Connecting for Health may use the existing contracts to get both BT and CSC to take over different parts of Fujitsu’s uncompleted work: an approach that could give NHS trusts in the south more choice. Cerner, the key software supplier for the south may take a bigger role. And Connecting for Health has also just signed a framework contract with a range of other, new, suppliers that could be brought into play.All that will be the subject of fraught negotiation. For now, the programme feels as if it is on a knife-edge.
347;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-05-29T16:32:52Z;Response to Alastair McAulay’s article on whether it will live up to its billing;;"THREE ISSUES MUST BE ADDRESSED BY PROVIDERS BEFORE CLOUD COMPUTING IS READY FOR PRIME-TIMECloud computing has received plenty of attention of late. Its colourful name notwithstanding, it promises tangible benefits to its users such as sourcing flexibility for hardware and software, a pay-as-you-go rather than fixed-cost approach, continuous upgrades for mission-critical enterprise software, and the centralised management of user software.Yet, as presently constituted, cloud computing may not be a panacea for every organization. The hardware, software and desktop clouds are mature enough for early adopters. Amazon, for example, can already point to more than 10 billion objects on its storage cloud; Salesforce.com generated more than $740 million in revenues for its 2008 fiscal year; and Google includes General Electric and Procter & Gamble among the users of its desktop cloud. However, several issues must still be addressed and these involve three critical matters: where data resides, the security of software and data against malicious attacks, and performance requirements.DataSay you use Salesforce.com as your Software as a Service (SaaS) provider. In theory, this is where you would locate your CRM data. However, in practice, most organisations are likely to have proprietary applications running on their own data center and that use the same data. Furthermore, if one provider is used for CRM, another for human resources and yet another for enterprise resource planning, there’s likely to be considerable overlap between the data used by the three providers and the proprietary applications in the company’s own data center.So where do you locate the data?There are existing and potential options. First, is the platform scenario. Some SaaS providers have evolved from offering single vertical capability (such as CRM) into providing SaaS ”platforms” that bundle their vertical capability with a development environment and an integration environment. The theory is that while an enterprise may use multiple SaaS providers and proprietary applications, there will be a primary provider that hosts all the data and provides a development environment where data can be integrated with all the applications (including other SaaS) using the data.Next, is the database-as-a-service scenario. In this case, one provider – which could be the organisation’s data center – only hosts the data and provides ”database as a service” to all the applications. While this model does not presently exist, it’s a distinct possibility that would offer the advantage of not tying the enterprise to a single SaaS provider for all its data and integration needs.SecurityPerhaps the primary concern when it comes to cloud computing is security. While this is likely to be a significant near-term concern, one could argue that a large SaaS provider whose entire business is predicated on securing its clients’ data and applications would be in a better position to do so than the IT organisation of a single company itself. As an example of the confidence certain global organisations have in this new paradigm, Citigroup recently signed up 30,000 users with Salesforce.com to address CRM needs after extensive evaluation of the SaaS provider’s security infrastructure.The point is that providers are endeavoring to improve their offerings to meet clients’ enterprise-grade security needs. Still, companies in certain industries, such as defence, aerospace and brokerage, are likely to avoid the cloud computing environment because of their security and compliance concerns.However, not too far off is the emergence of “gated community” clouds that, like gated communities, would keep out the riffraff. These highly selective private clouds or consortia would have dedicated networks that connect only their members. Unlike a single company’s data center, a private cloud can consolidate the hardware and software needs of multiple companies, provide load balancing and economies of scale, and still eliminate many of the security concerns.PerformanceWhile the Internet is fast enough to send data to a user from a remote server, it lacks the speed to handle large transaction volume with stringent performance needs if the applications must access their databases through the internet.The emergence of a full ecosystem of enterprise SaaS (for ERP, HR, CRM, supply chain management) plus database-as-a-service, all within a single hardware cloud, will help solve performance problems. An ecosystem cloud also has the added advantage of better integration across the different providers that are part of the same ecosystem.Just as today’s enterprise software falls into distinct ecosystems (Microsoft, Oracle, SAP), cloud computing may well organize itself in a similar fashion, with a number of hardware clouds and a set of complementary (non-competing) SaaS providers and a database-as-a-service provider.For now, cloud computing offers several potential benefits for both small and large companies: lower IT costs, faster deployment of new IT capabilities, an elastic IT infrastructure that can expand or contract as needed and, most importantly, a CIO freed from the more mundane aspects of managing the IT infrastructure. In fact, industry analyst Gartner estimates that by 2012, one in every three dollars spent on enterprise software will be a service subscription rather than a product license and that early adopters will purchase as much as 40 percent of their hardware infrastructure as a service rather than as equipment.Although individual aspects of cloud computing are already relatively mature, how they will all come together and which of the scenarios discussed will play out remains unclear. For now, organisations that take a tactical approach that includes moving aging, non-strategic applications to a hardware cloud: using SaaS for processes that don’t have a significant data overlap with other critical processes and experimenting with network-based desktop for small, deskbound workforces can gain valuable experience and insight into how to take advantage of this emerging phenomenon.This gives CIOs ample time to develop long-term strategies as the paradigm continues to evolve in order to solve those data, security and performance issues."
348;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-05-28T21:16:12Z;NHS hit as Fujitsu fired from IT project;;The NHS’s £12.7bn programme to provide every patient in England with an electronic care record suffered a severe blow on Wednesday as the project fired one of its key suppliers after failing to resolve a wrangle over the contract.Ten months of renegotiations with Fujitsu, which holds the £896m 10-year contract for installing the record across the whole of the south and west of England, have broken down, according to both the company and the NHS.The dispute centred on the NHS’s demand for more flexibility in delivery of the services – a request that would cost more. Fujitsu wanted either more money or a return to the original contract specifications.Connecting for Health, the NHS IT programme, said it is now to issue a termination notice to Fujitsu in a move that could cost the Japanese-owned services company an estimated £300m.It is the second time the programme has lost one of its big four suppliers after Accenture withdrew in 2006 at a substantial cost to the company.BT, which runs the programme in London, is the favourite to take over from Fujitsu as Computer Sciences Corporation, which runs the whole of the north and Midlands, uses different software to BT and Fujitsu for the record.The breakdown is a blow to the programme, although its defenders will argue that the contract structure of having an original four big suppliers is likely to work as BT or CSC is likely to step in.But the breakdown can only further delay a programme whose core product – the electronic record – is already running more than four years late.Connecting for Health said: “Regrettably, it has not been possible to reach an agreement on the core Fujitsu contract that is acceptable to all parties. The NHS will therefore end the contract early by issuing a termination notice.”That is understood to give Fujitsu 20 days to register a counter claim, with the possibility that differences will have to be settled in court.Connecting for Health said Fujitsu had made a commitment “to providing a smooth transition to new arrangements”, without specifying what those would be.BT must be the clear favourite to take over if it wants the business.Given that it uses the same Cerner software that Fujitsu has been installing in the south, BT will be in a strong negotiating position during any takeover talks.A switch to CSC would be likely to involve a switch to iSoft’s as yet unproved Lorenzo software. BT said Wednesday night it would consider any approach from the NHS to take on the extra work.Fujitsu confirmed that talks had broken down and the company had wanted to revert to the original contract, which provided less flexibility than the NHS is now seeking. Failure to agree a price for that lay behind the breakdown, a Fujitsu official confirmed.
349;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-05-18T16:28:51Z;Sabbaticals nurture stars;;When Andrew Clark swapped his job as a Washington-based fraud investigation manager at Ernst & Young to work in Argentina for Progen, the country’s only distributor of generic medicines, he found himself working from the company’s conference room and having to run down to the local market to make photocopies. For Mr Clark, this was not a step backwards in his career but an opportunity offered by Ernst & Young’s Corporate Responsibility Fellows programme.The unfamiliarity of his new role was exhilarating. “This is the best executive leadership programme imaginable,” Mr Clark says. “All the stuff that makes life easy in my day-to-day job was taken away from me and I had to work with what I had.”The scheme – which sends Ernst & Young’s most valued staff to work as consultants for three months at small enterprises in emerging markets – benefits employees and the companies they work with. But it also enhances the profile of the global professional services firm as well as helping to develop and retain staff. Companies offering similar programmes include Accenture, IBM, PwC, Pfizer and Cisco.The programmes come at a high price. Companies must match the right staff to positions and logistics, either internally or via external partners, as well as pay for transport and accommodation. The highest cost accrues from diverting top-performing executives away from their desks for several months.However, the benefits outweigh the costs, particularly by establishing a presence in new markets, according to Elmira Bayrasli, head of partnership policy and outreach at Endeavor, a non-profit organisation that helps firms to place their executives.“When a partner comes in and restructures a company’s human resources department and [it is] then able to hire 40 people per month within a community, that community is going to be grateful,” says Ms Bayrasli. “That’s the type of PR money can’t buy.”And as more employees seek careers that allow them to tackle social and environmental problems, overseas volunteering programmes are also proving to be an effective way to recruit and retain employees.“We think IBM’s Corporate Service Corps will be a huge draw at university campuses and recruiting events,” says Stanley Litow, head of corporate citizenship and corporate affairs at IBM, whose new programme will send employees to work on projects in Romania, Turkey, Vietnam, the Philippines, Ghana and Tanzania.Some 5,000 employees applied for the 100 places in IBM’s scheme. “We have tapped into an extraordinary amount of interest and excitement among our employees,” Mr Litow says. “There is a real hunger among our emerging leaders to take the skills and abilities honed in the private sector and apply them against society’s toughest challenges.”This also means that companies can use sabbaticals as incentives to reward individuals they want to groom for senior positions. This is the case with Ernst & Young’s programme, says Greg Hills, director of FSG Social Impact Advisors and co-author of the firm’s recent report Volunteering for Impact*. “They are being selected out of a larger group of people,” he says. “It’s an interesting carrot for people to look forward to once they get to middle management level.”Companies also benefit from the skills their employees acquire. “They will learn how to function in unique cultural situations,” says Mr Litow.For Mr Clark, one of the lasting lessons was learning to cut through corporate jargon. “When you’re in an environment where you’re coping with culture and language challenges, you learn to speak succinctly,” he says. “I now tend to get the point a lot quicker.”* Volunteering for Impact: Best Practices in International Corporate Volunteering, by Greg Hills and Adeeb Mahmud, FSG Social Impact Advisors, September 2007
350;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-05-14T03:17:59Z;Process management: Making complex business simpler;;"Steven S Smith, chief technology officer for the US bank Wells Fargo Financial, introduced his company to business process management last year.Note how he did it: “I didn’t go to our divisional chief executive and say: ‘We are going to invest in this tool’. Instead, we brought the technology in and worked together with the business on a specific issue. It was the business manager who presented to the divisional CEO. He said: ‘Look at the benefits of this new technology’.“All the IT people were sitting in the room with big smiles on their faces. They didn’t have to say a word. It was the business bragging about how wonderful it is,” he says.When the business side of an organisation has good things to say, unprompted, about a new technology, something unusual is happening and, for many companies, that something is business process management.It is a methodology underpinned by a technology and it is a hot ticket.Accenture, the world’s largest consultancy, already has a global director for BPM, Jim Adamczyk.He describes it as a mindset: “It is something that has mostly been going on for a long time. What has changed is the convergence of the business need for process engineering with the evolution of technology that lets people build systems flexible enough to supply the need.”In a new book* Kiran Garimella, Michael Lees and Bruce Williams of Software AG, the European consultancy, say that BPM represents a culmination of all the collective experience, thinking and professional development in business management over the past several decades.“It’s customer first. It’s business focused, it empowers people in all corners of a business to be more successful. It brings people and systems together. BPM is where all the lofty goals and best strategies are coming home to roost,” they say.It sounds too good to be true and it has already attracted the attention of a string of software houses and consultancies from the “pure play” vendors such as Pegasystems, Savvion and Lombardi at one end to the big “stack” vendors including Oracle and IBM at the other.It is easy to see why Mr Adamczyk worries: “I fear that this is being hyped as one of our endless series of silver bullets, but at core we are trying to align the domain of the business – what the business needs – with what IT can understand and build.”What is driving the adoption of BPM? Ram Menon, head of worldwide marketing for the pure play vendor Tibco, argues that increasing business complexity is the chief cause: “At the core, it’s about agility, efficiency and productivity. Businesses are continually under pressure to get more work done with fewer resources.“Regulatory compliance is another driver. Rules such as the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments directive (MiFID) and Sarbanes-Oxley in the US have a significant process dimension. In healthcare, it’s HIPAA. Almost every industry has its list of compliance requirements.“Used appropriately, BPM helps companies streamline processes, reduce cycle times and get things done faster. This frees employees to focus on areas where they can add real value.”BPM provides the tools to enable organisations to examine, analyse and improve their processes, with a process being anything that transforms resources and materials into products or services.“This transformation is how a business works; it’s the magic elixir of the enterprise,” say the Software AG authors. “The more effective this transformation, the more successfully you create value.”BPM software provides the technological underpinning that facilitates communication and mobility of data across applications. Only in the past few years has the software become mature enough to be used reliably for this purpose.There are four main phases: process analysis, process design, process automation and business activity monitoring – which provides the feedback for further improvements.Here are two examples of BPM in action.University College London Hospitals comprises seven large hospitals in central London treating hundreds of thousands of in and out-patients each year through a bewilderingly large number of specialisms.Government targets demand that no more than 18 weeks elapse between first referral and the start of treatment. James Thomas, UCLH IT director, knew the existing manual methods of tracking patients through what are known as “care pathways” could not cope.He wanted to introduce technology that would enable tracking by exception. Only if a staging post on the care pathway failed – a missing laboratory report, for example – would a warning flag be raised. The UCLH system sends an e-mail to the individual responsible to alert them to the deficiency.In conjunction with Logica CMG, the consultancy, Mr Thomas used BPM software from Lombardi to map the care pathway for a single specialism, discovering in the process that the first and last thirds of the process are identical. The middle third depends on the particular specialism involved.Business activity monitoring (BAM) software was used to monitor the progress of the patient along the pathway. “It’s your conscience. It’s an incredibly good policeman,” Mr Thomas says.The system will be live across one hospital in the group by the end of this month; the whole of UCLH by the end of the year. But it has not been easy: “Getting people to acknowledge that they work to processes and to document those processes and then work through harmonising those processes is not easy. You’re talking about administrative and clinical staff in different hospital buildings.“Potentially, people might see this as a form of electronic Big Brother that sends them e-mails when they haven’t done something. We have to turn that on its head and say the task facing us is too big for our current way of working – this is something to help us break up and digest the problem.”At Wells Fargo Financial, Mr Smith was concerned that it was taking too long to complete certain business processes. The test bed for the BPM software that he brought in was the process that tracked the answers the bank gave customers who asked for a loan.“The specific issue was: how to track the salesperson’s response to the customer after a decision had been made on a loan. If the customer failed to take up the loan even if it was approved, what was the reason,” Mr Smith says.Tracking the process manually would have required hiring another 20 staff across the US; four were already in place.The BPM software took four months to install – Mr Smith blames the delay on his team’s reluctance to use “agile” development methods rather than the tried and tested “waterfall” technique – but it resulted in automating the process for the whole of North America using three rather than the four existing staff.The bank has implemented a number of BPM systems after that first deployment. In one, the process for adding a new merchant to the bank’s private label credit card product, which used to take weeks now takes only a day or so.Mr Smith says that, with so many BPM vendors, it is important to choose the most appropriate by bringing them into the facility and asking them to interface with the existing systems.These two examples demonstrate important principles of BPM deployment.First, the need to start in a small way – a single process such as Mr Thomas’s patient care pathway or Mr Smith’s loan agreement is enough for proof of concept.Second, the need to capture the hearts and the minds of the people who have to use the system. Mr Thomas insisted, for example, that hospital staff would not have to use new techniques or undergo extra training to make full use of the system.Rod Favaron, chief executive of Lombardi, says companies will see three kinds of benefits from BPM, properly deployed: effficiency, effectiveness and agility.“In the era of Service Oriented Architecture and on-demand market messages, agility is a well understood concept. In the world of process management, the ability to change quickly is essential,” he says.“Customers on average change their key processes between four and seven times a year. New opportunities can arise. New partners or customers need you to support a different way of doing business.“Government regulations can require companies to change their processes. BPM provides the platform they need to be able to change processes faster and in a more controlled fashion than any other option.”*BPM Basics for Dummies by Kiran Garimella, Michael Lees and Bruce Williams, Wiley Publishing.

351;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-05-12T14:08:47Z;Centrica warns profits to fall;;Centrica on Monday warned first-half operating profits would be “materially lower” than a year ago and cautioned that the high wholesale gas and electricity prices behind the slump in performance were set to continue into the second half.In February the energy group said margins were under pressure and on Monday it said profit margins had been pushed below long-run targets. Full-year earnings per share are now seen at the lower end of market expectations.Hinting that further price rises for its millions of business and residential customers were possible later this year, Centrica said in a trading update that “we will take the necessary action to deliver reasonable margins in the retail business”.Centrica, which controls British Gas, said month gas and electricity futures prices had doubled in the last year.The shares reversed earlier losses to trade 9¼p or 3.2 per cent, higher in London at 296¾p. The expectation of a profit warning saw the price lose some 4.3 per cent last week.Those cost increases saw gas suppliers raise their domestic tariffs earlier this year. That move came just as British Gas’s residential division was beginning to recoup customers who defected when it raised its prices ahead of competitors last year and experienced problems with its billing system.When full-year results were announced in February, the company said its tally of residential customers had risen above 16m again but in Monday’s interim statement it said the number had slipped back to 15.9m.The residential business accounted for 40 per cent of group revenues last year and 30 per cent of profits.Uswitch, the price comparison website, said on Monday that given the gas market environment households would be “lucky” if prices rose only 10 per cent by late summer, with a further 15 per cent rise in January next year expected. Citigroup said it expected Centrica to raise its prices by 12-18 per cent later this year.For 2008, the company said its upstream division’s performance would be very strong but it would be offset in part by lost sales. Also, the shift in business mix will increase the tax rate to around 55 per cent.It emerged over the weekend that Centrica is seeking to claim £182m in damages from Accenture who designed the company’s billing system that was introduced in 2006.Customer complaints against British Gas soared, and it was forced to hire up to 2,500 additional staff at one point to deal with the problems created. Accenture described the claim as “baseless and without merit”.
352;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Accenture rejects British Gas writ;;Accenture, the consultancy, has described as “baseless and without merit” a £182m claim from British Gas over the disastrous introduction of its new billing system.Centrica, owner of British Gas, was forced to write off almost £200m as a result of problems with the system, which came into use in 2006.Customer complaints against British Gas soared, and it was forced to hire up to 2,500 additional staff at one point to deal with the problems created.It also had to pay for extra work and commit management time to fixing the system. It is now claiming those costs back from Accenture in a writ filed at the High Court last week.Centrica is expected to talk about the case at its annual general meeting on Monday.Accenture was hired in 2001 to design and implement the new system, known as Jupiter.As British Gas switched to the new system in 2006, complaints about mistakes in billing mounted, reaching a peak in the second half of that year and into early 2007.Having been seen earlier in the decade as one of the better energy suppliers for customer service, it became seen as by far the worst, although complaints have subsequently fallen sharply.British Gas alleged in a statement : “Accenture was responsible for fundamental errors in the design and implementation of the system.” It said this assessment had been delivered by another consultancy hired to analyse the problem.However, Accenture said it rejected responsibility.It said: “Centrica directed the design, build and implementation of the Jupiter system and insisted on many of the features they now find problematic.”
353;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-03-19T00:10:37Z;Interview: Dawn Haig-Thomas says mobiles can close the digital divide;;"Dawn Haig-Thomas, director of the GSM Association Development Fund, betrays an uncharacteristic impatience with an uncomprehending public.“It amazes me that people still don’t understand the impact of mobile technologies on the developing world. I am still asked at dinner parties: ‘Why do Africans need mobile phones?’. This is an area where we need good education and public relations,” she says.She has been head of the London-based organisation since a few months after its creation in October 2005: “It was just me for the first four months.”It had about $1m in the kitty and a handful of projects on the go. Now it has an annual budget of €2.5m ($4m) and has completed 19 projects in 11 countries in Africa and Asia, many of them with the potential to be deployed in developing areas elsewhere.The Development Fund is the mobile phone industry’s principal contribution to closing the “digital divide”, the gap between technologically advanced countries and developing nations.“The Fund looks specifically at how mobile phones can be used in social, economic and environmental development,” she says. “We are about action, about running pilot projects that hopefully will lead to commercial scale-ups. We are about catalysing markets and incubating ideas.”The need for such an organisation is clear. The importance of mobile phones and the internet to growth in developing countries was underlined only last month by a United Nations report confirming that technology drives innovation and helps create financial structures that encourage entrepreneurship.And Ms Haig-Thomas makes it clear that her organisation is neither a charity nor a traditional example of corporate social responsibility – although she accepts the mobile phone industry has a social responsibility to help bridge the digital divide.“A key principle of the Development Fund is that doing good is good business. We believe there is a sweet spot where initiatives are good for both profit and social welfare and that is the space we play in,” she says.A graduate in politics and history from Manchester University, Ms Haig-Thomas is by no means a traditional technologist. She says her greatest satisfaction comes from seeing people use technology for the first time and realising how it could enrich their lives: a mother using a web camera to keep contact with her children working many miles away; an individual realising he or she does not have to travel expensively into town to fill in a form or apply for a job.After studying international business at Manchester Business School, she worked for the consultancy Accenture for nine years, where she honed her digital skills, programming in C++ and configuring systems.She explains: “While I would say I’m not a technologist, other people would say I am because of that background. I have a grasp of IT and IT systems and how they can be used.“Once you have that background, you understand the limits and the breadth of technology and you are not scared of it.”During her time with Accenture, she worked on projects for companies in the retail, travel and transportation sectors before being attracted to the idea of working for Accenture development partnerships, a non-profit arm of the company.Consultants take a 50 per cent cut in salary to transfer into the group and are assigned an overseas posting with a charity or development agency.Ms Haig-Thomas was sent to India to work with Sewa (self-employed women’s association), a non-governmental organisation, examining how women producers in the state of Gujarat could sell their goods for higher prices via the internet.She lived in the state capital, Ahmedabad, for five months and found it an inspiring experience. “This really seized my imagination,” she says. “It was 2003 and they had had drought, earthquakes, cyclones and riots. It was fascinating to see how people can sustain themselves using technology despite environmental or political catastrophes.”But a 50 per cent cut in salary? “Interesting work is my main driver; I’m not incentivised by money,” she says. “The output of the project was the establishment of a company in Mumbai that is now trading with the Scandinavian retailer Ikea and the UK chain Marks and Spencer. We got $7m funding from the Indian government, so it was very successful.”Returning to London, she again worked for Accenture before the Development Fund job came up. How did she approach the challenge of leading such an organisation?“This wasn’t another project, this was a legal entity in its own right, so we had to look at everything right down to the strategy, where we were today and where we wanted to be after one year and after five years.“There is huge scope in mobile, so we did an analysis of where we believed we could add the most value. There was a lot of relationship-building with mobile operators and vendors. I went to visit the World Bank and the UN and did a lot of networking.”The Fund was financed in the first place by the US group Motorola, which was persuaded to hand over some of the profits from its success in winning the contract to develop a $30 handset for the developing world. The GSM provides running costs and Ms Haig-Thomas reports directly to Rob Conway, the chief executive.The GSM’s objective in establishing the Fund, of course, is to catalyse markets that will ultimately benefit its members.She points to the success of community information centres in Bangladesh as an example of the Fund in action.It is based on the example of Grameenphone’s “village phone” project, where a local entrepreneur sets up a business around a single phone in a village where the inhabitants are too poor to own their own.The Fund, working with Grameenphone, established bases in remote villages where people can pay small sums for access to the internet, the data being carried the last mile wirelessly.Sixteen bases were established as a trial; within four months it had proved so successful that it has now been scaled up to 560 bases and the example has been replicated in Pakistan and South Africa.A key concern for the Fund, however, is power – or the lack of it. Without electricity it is impossible to run base stations or charge handsets, so the Fund has been experimenting with wind and solar power and biofuels.In Namibia, for example, an experiment in conjunction with Motorola involving wind and solar energy produced so much power that ways of feeding the excess back to the village are being sought.“It is a hot, hot area,” Ms Haig-Thomas says. “The one area in which I get the most inquiries from operators globally is alternative energy.“It’s the problem everybody is facing. There are 3bn people connected to the networks; how do we get to the next 3bn?”Solar cells, wind turbines and fermentation are somewhat removed from the GSMA’s usual interests in networking protocols and bit rates.They are just three more technologies Ms Haig-Thomas will have to master in her campaign to show why Africans need mobile phones."
354;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-03-16T22:03:48Z;Retailers clash with Pepsi over free music;;Pepsi is at odds with some of its biggest US retail customers over a national marketing campaign offering free digital music downloads from online retailer Amazon.The deal represents Amazon’s biggest-ever marketing partnership with another brand, and is an important part of its efforts to drive traffic to the fledgling MP3 “DRM free” music download service it launched last year.But the partnership has antagonised rival bricks-and-mortar retailers. Amazon’s media and electronics business competes directly with Wal-Mart and Target, the two largest mass retailers, while its rapidly growing grocery business competes with major supermarkets.“You have to ask yourself why Pepsi would team up with a company that doesn’t sell its products, and risk antagonising all the people that do sell its products,” said a source at one retailer.The programme was launched with a high-profile television ad featuring pop-star Justin Timberlake during February’s US Superbowl. But the promotion has received little attention in grocery aisles.In an apparent response to retailers’ concerns, Amazon’s name has been banished from the front of Pepsi bottles carrying the promotion – rendering it invisible in supermarket aisles to passing shoppers.Similarly, Amazon’s logo is on the back of cardboard multi-pack cartons of cans that are stacked on the shelves of mass discounters and supermarkets, next to the product’s bar code and nutritional information.The treatment contrasts with a promotion between Pepsi and Apple’s iTunes, in which the iTunes name was carried prominently.Jeff Smith, retail consultant at Accenture, argues the tensions reflect underlying challenges for Pepsi and other brands in adapting the traditional way they communicate with retailers to accomodate new digital selling and marketing channels.“The thing they didn’t think about is that anyone selling Pepsi in the general merchandise or electronics business is going to feel that they were promoting a competitor,” he says.Wal-Mart accounts for 18 per cent of North American sales of Pepsi’s parent PepsiCo, while about a third of PepsiCo’s North American sales come from just five retailers. The store has its own Mp3 download service.Both Pepsi and Amazon declined to comment.
355;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;‘Romanians like to party past 4am’;;"Andrea Multari, 38, grew up in Rome. After spending nine years in the Italian navy he did an MBA and joined the management consulting company Accenture. He has since been posted all over Europe (the UK, France, Hungary) and now lives in Bucharest, Romania, with his Romanian wife, Oana, and baby son, Roberto.I moved to Bucharest last year for personal and professional reasons. However, I was already familiar with the country, having regularly travelled there to see my fiancée – and now wife – since meeting her in Slovakia three years ago while we were working on consulting projects. After being based in different countries for a while, we decided that we needed to live in the same place if we were to have a family. She wanted to live in Bucharest. But doing so was also good for me from a career viewpoint since my company had recently opened an office in Romania and needed an experienced person willing to stay on for some time to develop the business.Moving to Bucharest was relatively straightforward. It was my second or third relocation in the space of a few years. Working in France and the Czech Republic made the move that much easier. Knowing we planned to stay for a while, my wife and I bought an apartment a year or so ago in a nice residential area, near Herastrau Park, where most of the embassies are located. The only challenge was that my company asked me to relocate a couple of months before I had planned to do so, forcing me to speed up a number of activities, such as the buying of furniture for the new apartment.Property is surprisingly expensive. It might have been cheap once but prices have risen substantially in recent years – although that depends very much on the area. We bought a brand new apartment, for about €200,000, that had yet to be completed. However, people have since told me that we got our apartment for a pretty good price; it would certainly cost more to buy a similar one now. Besides, the area has lots going for it. It’s great for children, since there are a number of kids’ amenities. Hopefully it will prove a good investment.Winters can be harsh. This year the temperature has been as low as -15°C. We’ve also had a lot of snow. However, whereas London or Paris would have been brought to a standstill by such heavy snowfalls, Bucharest has coped pretty well. Summers, on the other hand, can be hot – sometimes too hot – with temperatures reaching 30°C in May and even 40°C on the odd day in June and July. Thankfully there are some nice parks and lakes within easy reach. There are also several mountain resorts in the Carpathians – two or three hours’ drive away. The most popular are Sinaia and Poiana Brasov. My wife skis and while I don’t because I have a problem with my knees, I love to drive in the mountains, which are beautiful at this time of the year.Bucharest’s transport system is inadequate to the needs of a growing city population. The tram and bus services and the three underground lines might be OK downtown but they deteriorate sharply further out. Roadwise, the large French-style boulevards crossing the city centre help ease traffic flow. However, the growth of property (both residential and commercial) in the city has not been accompanied by the development of adequate infrastructure. Transportation is an issue in Romania as a whole, with both business and tourism affected by poor traffic systems. There are only two short motorways, neither of which is up to west European standards. Roads often go through villages, which can make trips across the country slow. Hopefully European Union investment will help improve things with time.On my first visit I was expecting to find everyday goods a lot cheaper than back home. However, I soon found out that certain things (such as clothes) are sometimes more expensive than in Italy. Similarly, property prices in parts of Bucharest are getting close to west European levels – though prices in the poorer parts of the city, such as those dominated by old communist-era blocks, are perhaps falling. Eating out, on the other hand, is on average less expensive than in Italy – and if you travel outside the city, many things are cheaper.Traditional Romanian food seems to be for carnivores. I’ve acquired a taste for certain aspects of the cuisine. I like the soups, especially ciorba, a rich soup with meat, cream and vegetables. And I’m quite partial to sarmale, a cabbage roll stuffed with minced meat. I was surprised to learn that some Romanian food has an equivalent Italian version (mamaliga compares to Italian polenta; a corn-based side dish for meat). However, there are plenty of good restaurants offering international cuisine for those who prefer western-style dishes.The work culture is similar to that found in Italy and Spain, in the sense that people do not work in a very structured way – unlike in the UK, Germany or the Netherlands. That said, they eventually reach their objectives thanks to their commitment and “creativity”. They like their coffee breaks, but they are prepared to work long hours. What I most like about Romanians is their desire to catch up with the west in terms of best practice, methodology and productivity, making up for the lost time of the communist era. This sentiment is strongest among younger people.I relax by going swimming and taking walks with my family in the parks in Bucharest and outside the city. I live near one of them, which has a large lake that is particularly picturesque in the winter, when the water freezes over and the trees are covered in snow. We don’t tend to go to the cinema or theatre much because I’m not yet fluent in Romanian. I don’t really need it for my work – I can survive quite adequately with English, French and Italian – but I am learning the language.The culture shock on moving here was not that great, perhaps because I have worked and lived in so many countries over the last few years that I’ve got used to different environments, cultures and habits. Surprisingly, for an Italian, the thing I miss most about my homeland is not the food, because there are a number of good restaurants. What I miss most about Italy is the architecture, the culture and, having been in the navy, the sea. The Black Sea is three to four hours’ drive away and, although there are some nice resorts nearby, it’s not the same as going to the seaside.I like the Romanians’ cheerful attitude – and their willingness to party. If you go to a wedding, most west Europeans will be in bed by 4am but Romanians, whether they are seven or 70, are still dancing away. On the negative side, some parts of Bucharest are still dominated by gloomy old communist blocks. I don’t much like driving in the city either – the driving style is quite aggressive. Hearing this from an Italian should give you an idea of just how bad it is."

Not only former communist countries that have now joined the EU but Russia and those in the Arab world and north Africa, boosted by high commodity prices, were becoming big customers.EU 15 exports to the developing world quadrupled to $1,000 bn between 1990 and 2006. As a proportion of total exports they grew from 52 per cent to 64 per cent of EU exports were to“In essence the EU has its own China right next door. It is about Europeanisation as much as globalisation,” Mr Hamilton said.Proximity to the booming market has lured investment from US companies. Deregulating the service sector would further increase the benefits. “It is the sleeping giant of the European economy,” said Mr Hamilton.He said some countries competing head-on with India and China in low-skilled industries had suffered. Portugal had lost a quarter of its jobs because of reliance on industries such as footwear. While Ireland lost a similar proportion, they had been replaced by jobs created by US and other companies themselves offshoring.The UK was the only country that had outsourced significant numbers of jobs to Asia. Some 90 per cent of jobs lost in Germany, for example, had gone to its neighbours in eastern Europe. Germany, meanwhile, still the world’s biggest exporter, was gaining fresh jobs as its skilled labour attracted research and development operations.However, the study warned that skill shortages would soon begin to bite.Europe needed to attract more skilled workers from abroad. Just 5 per cent of skilled migrant workers head there ecompared with 55 per cent to the US. The impending skills shortage could cost the German economy $27bn a year (1% of GDP).Mike Baunton, vice-president of European operations for Caterpillar, the US construction equipment maker, said: “There is an exodus of high-skilled jobs because companies cannot find qualified staff. It is easier to find an engineer in Beijing than Budapest.”Bernard Pellereau, of Honeywell, said Europe needed to decide in which sectors it wanted to specialise and then educate and equip people for it.
357;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Women urged to think big;;A group of multinational companies is backing a new government initiative aimed at reducing the barriers to female entrepreneurs securing large corporate contracts.Women in Enterprise Connecting to Contracts (WEConnect) is a certification scheme for businesses that care at least 51 per cent owned by a woman.Pfizer, Microsoft, Bank of America, Accenture and other large corporations that have already signed up to the scheme will be able to use WEConnect’s database to find businesses that could bid for contracts and help meet diversity targets. Companies that have gained WEConnect certification will in turn get an inside track on what work is being put to tender by these companies.Although 16 per cent of UK businesses are female owned, they only win 3 to 5 per cent of corporate and public sector contracts, according to Women’s Enterprise Task Force (WETF), the government body that has created WEConnect.Pam Alexander, co-chair of WETF and chief executive of the South East England Development Agency, said: “By creating new routes to procurement opportunities, WEConnect will encourage more women to think big, expand their businesses and achieve their potential.”WEConnect is based on a US scheme, created 11 years ago. Gordon Brown, when he was chancellor, said that if the UK could achieve the same level of entrepreneurship as the US, it would have three quarters of a million more businesses.Joe Hill, executive vice-president at Bank of America, which was an early supporter of the US scheme, said it was not about filling quotas and WEConnect companies would have to compete for contracts as usual. “From a supply chain standpoint, the more diverse your supply chain is, the stronger it is,” he said.He added that there was also an element of “enlightened self interest” in that women-owned businesses who were helped by WEConnect might consider banking with Bank of America, given its early support for the scheme.
358;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:20:50+0000;Accenture’s next champion of waffle words;;"When one door closes, another one opens. On Thursday the prison gates clanked shut behind Martin Lukes in Florida but, in London, the door of an office inside Accenture swung ajar, revealing Mark Foster, a middle-aged white man with a long-winded title.Just as I was putting my final full stop to the story of the jargon-talking executive, someone forwarded me an internal e-mail sent by Accenture’s group chief executive for management consulting. Immediately I saw that this man could be a possible successor to Lukes. I don’t know if Mr Foster has Martin’s way with women or whether his golf swing is any good, as I have never met him. However, I have seen one of his e-mails and that is enough to convince me that, when it comes to world-class jargon, there is clear blue water between him and the rest – even at Accenture, where the bar, as they call it, is set so very high.This isn’t the first time I’ve singled out Accenture for its work in the jargon space. A couple of years ago, I wrote a column about its annual report, which was a perfect snapshot of the ugliest business language of the time. Inside was an orgy of “relentless passion” and “delivering value”. The point, presumably, was to impress clients.Yet Mr Foster’s e-mail is more troubling as it shows top people write like this even when they think no clients are looking. His memo was addressed to “All Accenture Senior Executives” – though title inflation being what it is, this probably stretches to include the cleaner. Indeed as “group chief executive”, Mr Foster is in a band of eight others with the same commanding title, and still has a couple of rungs to climb before reaching the very top.The memo starts with some background to the announcement: “…wanting to give you continued visibility of our growth platform agenda…” it says. Visibility is the latest thing in business. Companies and executives all crave it but, until last week, I didn’t know that growth platform agendas were after it too. What is he saying here, I wonder? I think, though couldn’t swear to it, that he wants to tell his colleagues how the company plans to make more money.And so to the meat of the memo. “We are changing the name of the Human Performance service line to Talent & Organization Performance, effective immediately.”Before you marvel at the stupidity of the name change, note first that departments can’t even be called that: they are instead “service lines”. As for the name, the old one may have been no great shakes, but to take away the “human” (which was surely the point) and replace it with “talent and organisation” is not progress. As I’ve often remarked before, the word “talent” is a hideous misnomer as most people aren’t terribly talented at all.Next comes the business rationale for the change. “With the rise of the multi-polar world, the task of finding and managing talent has become more complex, turbulent and contradictory than ever before.”This conflicts with two laws, the first of geography – there are only two poles – and the second of business – finding “talent” has always been hard as there isn’t enough to go round. The only excuse for saying it is “complex, turbulent and contradictory” is to make it sound so complicated that the services of Accenture must be needed to sort it out.Mr Foster says that what must be done is to teach organisations to “expand their talent management agenda from a narrow and tactical focus on human resources activities around the employee life cycle, to a broad and strategic focus on highly integrated systems of capabilities fundamental to business strategies and operations”. This is shameful, outrageous bilge. HR should be narrow. It should be specifically focused around the employee life cycle (if that means hiring, training, promoting, firing).His suggestion is frightening. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen quite so many waffle words crammed together in one sentence. Broad. Strategic. Focus. Highly. Integrated. System. Capabilities. Fundamental. Strategies. Indeed the only words here that are acceptable are “to”, “and” and “on”.I will spare you further long quotes from this dismal memo, which contains much “stepping up”, “blue water”, “space” and “walking the talk”. There is an obsession with capabilities. In four different places Mr Foster talks about “repositioning” them, “differentiating” them, “integrating” them and “evolving” them. This sounds like quite hard work, especially as I’m not quite sure what capabilities are anyway.There is only one sentence I like – “Already we are seeing great progress!” – though it would be better still without the gung-ho exclamation mark.Alas, the claim turns out to be unsubstantiated. The only progress mentioned is that the head of the newly named service line has written a book called The Talent Powered Organization and, to celebrate, Accenture is inviting clients to a party on Second Life – which I suppose cuts down on the bar bill.How much does all this nonsense matter? Accenture isn’t selling pensions to widows; if its rich corporate clients are prepared to buy HR services designed for a multi-polar world, that is their lookout.However, there is something else about the memo that worries me more. Accenture’s website reveals that, unlike Martin Lukes, Mr Foster has a classics degree from Oxford. I had always thought the point of studying classics was that it trained your mind and your pen. What this memo shows is that two decades at Accenture have a more potent effect on befuddling the mind than three years of Aeschylus and Horace ever had on sharpening it.lucy.kellaway@ft.comRead and post comments online at www.ft.com/kellaway"
359;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-01-23T22:06:32Z;Companies abandon ID card project;;Two prominent companies have pulled out of the procurement process for the controversial multi-billion pound identity card programme amid growing concerns that the government is planning to delay the roll-out of the project.The Financial Times has learnt that the IT services company Accenture and the defence company BAE Systems have decided not to pursue contracts linked to the biometric identity card system, with IT experts warning that some suppliers are growing increasingly frustrated with the government’s indecision.The Home Office said last night that the move by the two companies was the result of a “competitive dialogue process” with potential suppliers ahead of the announcement of a short-list of companies who later this spring will be invited to tender for contracts.“We believe we are still on track for a framework agreement, a contract which creates a list of pre-qualified suppliers, along with a set of agreed contractual terms,” the Home Office said.Accenture said a “mixture of political and commercial reasons” had led to its decision not to bid. BAE Systems was unavailable for comment last night.According to the Home Office, Fujitsu Services, CSC, EDS, IBM, Steria and Thales are still interested in the identity card project.The companies said that while the government may delay some parts of it, such as the issue of biometric cards to UK citizens, there would still be scope for other work in the near term, such as constructing the database to house the identity data.The Home Office’s Identity and Passport Service, which is running the scheme, aims to have a list of five prime suppliers in place by May. However, the Home Office confirmed on Tuesday that the government was considering a delay in the main roll-out of ID cards to British citizens.Leaked Home Office documents show a revised strategy in which the issuing of significant volumes of ID cards alongside a new generation of passports will begin in 2012, two years later than previously planned.Last night the Home Office confirmed a further leak suggesting that smaller volumes of ID cards should first be issued from 2010 onwards to young people to “assist” them in opening up their first bank accounts as well as to individuals employed in “positions of trust”, such as teachers and social workers.The British Bankers’ Association said that it had not been involved in any discussion on the use of ID cards by young people.“This has come like a bolt from the blue,” it said.Meanwhile, Damian Green, shadow immigration minister, said last night that the leaked documents showed that the government was engaged in an “outrageous plan” which was “staggering from shambles to shambles”.Mr Green said: “They are trying to introduce ID cards by stealth by making them necessary if you want to work for the government, take out a student loan or open a student bank account.“This is blackmail and a desperate attempt to bolster a failing policy.”
360;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-01-20T19:55:50Z;Top figures join UK social investors;;"Bridges Ventures, the venture capital firm founded by Sir Ronald Cohen to invest in deprived areas of the UK, will on Monday reveal an advisory board featuring some of the UK’s leading financial figures, highlighting the rising interest in social investing.Bridges, which last year raised a £75m fund entirely from the private sector, has a double objective: to invest in poor areas or socially beneficial projects while still achieving private equity’s historical returns of 12 per cent to 15 per cent.Its advisory board features Philip Yea, chief executive of 3i, the listed private equity group, and Tom Singh, the founder and non-executive director of New Look, the clothes retailer. Mr Singh and 3i co-founded Bridges with Sir Ronald.Social investing – or “venture capital with a social mission”, as Bridges describes itself – is growing, as leading private equity figures, such as Sir Ronald in the UK, and Henry Kravis of KKR in the US – look to assist society while still making a profit.Bridges’s board also features Vernon Ellis, international chairman of Accenture, the consultancy group; Kamal Tabet, global head of the financial entrepreneurs group at Citigroup; Harvey McGrath, non-executive chairman of Man Group, the hedge fund; and Lloyd Dorfman, founder of Travelex, the foreign exchange group.Bridges says the unpaid board members will meet twice a year to deal with “strategic issues, as well as providing a forum for discussion about social investment more generally”.Another notable member is David Blood, the former Goldman Sachs banker who co-founded Global Investment Management with Al Gore, the former US vice-president, to invest in equities with an emphasis on environmental and social sustainability.Bridges invests up to £10m in any single company. It applies a “social screen” to all its investments, requiring them either to be based in the poorest quarter of the UK or to produce “strong educational, healthcare or environmental benefits”.The advisory board also includes two Labour party backers caught up in the “cash-for-honours” affair who were already members of Bridges’s executive board.Sir Gulam Noon, the curry tycoon, and Chai Patel, the former chief of the Priory healthcare group, were among four people who secretly lent money for the Labour party’s general election campaign in 2005 and were later nominated for peerages.Their appointments show that Sir Ronald, himself a Labour party donor and adviser to Gordon Brown, prime minister, is standing by the two men. Bridges raised its first £40m fund with £20m from the government.Sir Gulam and Dr Patel had their peerage nominations blocked by the House of Lords after details of the secret loans emerged. A police enquiry into the affair has since finished and did not lead to any further action or suggestion of wrongdoing."
361;ACN;Accenture Plc;2008-01-01T16:06:55Z;Olympian hurdle for humble logo;;When the logo for the 2012 London Olympics was unveiled in June, the press dubbed the graffiti-style, brightly coloured type a “broken swastika” and a “toileting monkey”.Wolff Olins, the branding agency behind the logo, knew that it was breaking with tradition – it had produced a relatively tame design for the Athens games in 2004.But the furore over the logo design shows just how divisive such projects can be for the brands and companies involved.In his first interview since the launch, Sir Patrick Cox, creative director of Wolff Olins, told the FT: “We knew the work was going to invite comment because we were purposely not following precedent …Though I was surprised there were photographers outside my house.“We didn’t set out to create something strange for the sake of it. What has happened is everyone has agreed on what good taste is and also that brands need to present themselves as friendly and huggable.”Wolff Olins says the time was right to “decide against good taste” and had hoped the London logo would reinforce the promise given in Britain’s bid to revive Olympic interest among a multi-cultural, irreverent, technology-loving young audience. The public and media largely disagreed: petitions urged the logo to be ditched in favour of conventional leaping figures and London landmarks while press reports sniped at the £400,000 cost of the design.Locog, the London games organiser, and its sponsorship partners stood by the choice. They could take comfort from precedents that showed rebranding controversies could eventually turn out to be beneficial to businesses. Both Accenture and BP recovered from a shaky start after launching new corporate identities.When Andersen Consulting remade itself as Accenture, the consultancy was heavily criticised over its new name. Backed by high-profile global advertising, the Accenture rebranding, however, is now seen to have increased awareness of the brand, its consideration by potential customers and the brand’s overall value.Similarly, a study by research consultancy BrandEconomics of the value of BP’s “helios” brand in the three years after its rebranding in 2000 placed it in a list of 10 “breakaway” brands that had enjoyed remarkable growth in the value of their intangible assets – an achievement for a logo that had been dubbed flimsy by its critics.Now, six months after its unveiling, discussion about the London 2012 logo has died down – as shown by tracking of favourite internet forum topics by WaveMextrix, a web research group. But there is little sign that opposition has yet turned into approval.Martin Lambie-Nairn, chairman of the Lambie-Nairn firm, which has rebranded UK broadcasters Channel 4 and the BBC, thinks the Olympic launch was always likely to be controversial, particularly to a UK media critical of the rising cost of the games. “Launching brand identities to journalists is always very dangerous,” he says. “You show something for three minutes, and people go, ‘Is that it?’ The only thing the media is really interested in is the cost.”Mr Cox believes the controversy was an inevitable consequence of London’s bid to break with Olympic tradition: “London won the 2012 bid when Paris and New York were the clear favourites. It did so by saying the Olympic brand needed to change. And we needed to create something to register that shift,” he says.Given Locog’s success in signing up 2012 sponsors, there is little visible sign the row has had lasting commercial impact. But the real test will come once the Beijing games are over and 2012’s commercial timetable begins in earnest.However, design executives have drawn wider lessons from the debacle about the gulf of understanding between the brand design profession and the wider public. After all, it was not only the image that drew flak, but the vague language used to describe its “values” and objectives.“This industry has not found a language for talking about what we do,” says Ian Wood, European head of strategy at the Landor design group. “A new identity needs to be a signal of substantive change – otherwise, if you launch a logo, coupled with the shallow and vapid way these things get talked up, you head straight into pseuds’ corner.”Some favour the complete avoidance of brand-speak in public pronouncements. “It is very important that the kind of language used to talk about brands internally – sometimes in quite small working groups – is not allowed to burst outside to the wider public,” says Rita Clifton, chairman of Interbrand UK. “Every profession has its jargon: lawyers and accounts have it too. But marketing is always thought to be fair game for lampooning. You have to find a way of bringing brand thinking out without the jargon.”Will the logo gain acceptance over time? Mr Cox believes the answer turns on the distinction between logos and brands: “There are a lot of things in my life that I don’t necessarily like the mark of, but which I am still fond of. For instance, there is not much to like or dislike about Google’s identity. But it is an extremely useful tool so it holds a prominent place in the brands I use. That is the power of a brand rather than a logo.“At the moment, most people have a 2012 logo to form an opinion on rather than any 2012 experiences. But it is the things that 2012 will enable us all to do – and not just the logo – which will ultimately allow us to form opinions of the brand.”

Lehman said Capgemini was its preferred pick in the European IT sector, given its broad revenue mix, strong record on cost savings and rapidly expanding offshore capability.Financial stocks staged a mixed performance amid continued jitters in the credit markets. Swiss wealth manager UBS slid 0.8 per cent to SFr52.30 while France’s Natixis fell 1.5 per cent to €12.95, Credit Agricole shaved 0.7 per cent to €22.87 and Franco-Belgian Dexia shed 1 per cent to €16.87.Meanwhile, BNP Paribas added 0.5 per cent to €73.42, Spain’s Banco Santander climbed 0.6 per cent to €14.45 and Belgo-Dutch Fortis rose 0.8 per cent to €17.73.Rising crude oil prices gave a lift to energy stocks with France’s Total up 1.3 per cent to €55.25 and Austria’s OMV gaining 3.6 per cent to €53.74 and Portugal’s Galp Energia rising 1.5 per cent to €16.87.Spanish property company Inmobiliaria Colonial rebounded 7.3 per cent to €3.07 as investors took advantage of its five-day fall, prompted by fears about Spain’s property market.MVV, the German utility, surged 6.1 per cent to €33 after Société Générale said it expected the company to be in the forefront of consolidation in the country’s overly fragmented energy distribution sector.SocGen reinitiated coverage with a “buy” recommendation and a €35 price target and said MVV had a strong record on cost savings and integrating acquisitions. It noted that the company had €228m to invest after a recent capital raising.In the telecoms sector QSC, the German group, slipped 0.8 per cent to €2.64 after Credit Suisse cut its price target from €3.7 to €2.7 after chopping its underlying earnings forecast for this year by 38 per cent on concerns about rising cost pressures.Credit Suisse also said QSC could make an attractive bid target as further consolidation was likely in the German broadband market since operators that lacked scale were struggling to remain profitable.Telefónica edged up 0.3 per cent to €22.08 but Dresdner Kleinwort exp-ressed concern at the latest management reshuffle which included the resignation of Antonio Viana-Baptista, head of operations in Spain.Robert Grindle of Dresdner said: “His departure is a blow. We thought he was a candidate for the top job.”Greece’s Hellenic Telecom gained 3.5 per cent to €24.30 after announcing that it would split its fixed-line division into separate entities, one to service business clients and another to service residential customers.Metals groups regained their gleam with France’s ArcelorMittal rising 1.3 per cent to €49.56, Austria’s Voestalpine up 0.4 per cent to €47.10, and Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro jumping 2.7 per cent to NKr75.
363;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-12-10T17:26:54Z;Donations worth more than money;;Employee volunteering has long been a channel for corporate philanthropy, with companies allowing staff to take time off work to do everything from mentoring in schools to renovating community centres. However, as companies become both more strategic and global in their donation of staff time, many are sending staff on secondments or sabbaticals for several months at a time to work for charities and non-governmental organisations in developing countries.For the target organisations, the benefits are many. The time and expertise of the participants – particularly those from consulting firms – is often far more valuable than a simple cash donation. Moreover, while cash merely allows organisations to continue what they are doing, skilled consultants can make changes that will help them to operate more efficiently, thereby giving the donation a more lasting impact.“Employees spend several months immersed in these programmes and they can really make a difference,” says Charles Moore, executive director of the New York-based Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy. “And that’s often much more effective than sending cash or products – because you’re sending the brains into it.”Take Accenture Development Partnerships, a charitable organisation set up by Accenture to provide consulting services to charities, NGOs and other non-profit groups in developing countries. It sends only its top-performing executives to work on projects for up to six months.The service is not free. However, because Accenture makes no profits on the participating consultants, who agree to work for half their salary while on the scheme, the fees are affordable for non-profit organisations. “If you take off the margin and the overheads and half the main cost of a consulting business, which is the people, then you’re left with an amount that is a fraction of what we normally charge,” says Gib Bullock, ADP’s director.The projects that ADP participants work on include technical challenges that harness the IT skills and knowledge of Accenture consultants, such as revamping an organisation’s child sponsorship system and processes. In Kenya, ADP executives have been helping the African Medical & Research Foundation establish computer-based training for nurses.Working with Phones for Health Partnership, ADP consultants are helping to equip health workers in Africa with mobile phones that can track the spread of diseases such as malaria and HIV/Aids, thereby providing better information to governments on where drugs are needed.“We can help with deep IT skills but we also do a lot to help organisations and large NGOs work on change management and building their organisational strength,” says Mr Bullock. “That’s improving the effectiveness of the organisations to help them do what they do better.”Another well-established corporate initiative is the Global Health Fellows programme run at Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals company. It sends selected staff on assignments of up to six months, working with NGOs and multilateral organisations tackling diseases such as HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe and Latin America.As well as working on immediate medical and health problems, Pfizer specialists also train their local counterparts.Not all schemes involve overseas postings. As part of its Leadership Fellows programme, US technology group Cisco is sponsoring employees who live in Louisiana and Mississippi to work on a 21st Century Schools initiative that is rebuilding and improving educational institutions in areas that were affected by Hurricane Katrina.The Community Sabbatical Programme at Rhode Island-based Citizens Financial Group sends staff to work full time for three-month periods at non-profit social services agencies. On returning to the company, employees receive the same salary and responsibilities they had before they left. Since 1994, more than 90 have participated in the scheme.Through a volunteer leave scheme at Wells Fargo, the US bank, participants also regain their full salary and benefits after up to four months away from their jobs working with non-profits. Partner organisations include Under One Roof, which raises funds to combat HIV/Aids, the International Rescue Committee, which provides humanitarian aid and emergency relief to refugees, and the Audubon Centre of the North Woods, a wildlife rehabilitation facility in Minnesota.“Companies want to use their core competencies to invest in their communities,” says Mr Moore. “And the most successful companies in community investment and corporate philanthropy are those who become part of the solution.”However, as well as being part of the solution to tough social and environmental problems, what makes these programmes so compelling is the fact that the benefit is three-way. In addition to the services delivered to the charities and NGOs, companies gain insights into new markets and unfamiliar economic environments in which they would otherwise find it hard to establish a presence.“Our colleagues bring to the table a set of skills and expertise, but what they bring back is a deeper understanding of the local environment that we may not always have, as well as a real sense of what happens on the ground in poorly resourced areas,” says Robert Mallett, Pfizer’s senior vice-president of worldwide alliance development, philanthropy and corporate responsibility.“Trying to replicate the trust and relationships of an NGO with local communities is not something a company can easily do,” says Adrian Hodges, managing director of the International Business Leaders Forum, a UK-based membership organisation that works with business, governments and civil society.At the same time, companies are starting to see these intensive sabbaticals as powerful leadership development programmes. Participants gain experience of environments that are culturally and economically very different from those they are used to working in. “Increasingly, companies are recognising the business development and the human development opportunities in volunteering and development assignments for staff,” says Mr Hodges. “That means they have to be a bit more structured than they were in the past.”Often, it is the most promising employees who want to participate in the projects. Accenture’s feasibility study for ADP demonstrated a strong correlation between levels of interest in the programme and its highest performing executives.Perhaps the most compelling argument for companies engaging in this type of corporate philanthropy relates to the recruiting of business students and young executives. With a new generation of workers that is concerned about the social and environmental responsibility of its employers, running these types of volunteer programmes can give companies a competitive edge in the talent market.“Our proposition as Accenture is to say to people who are interested in Goldman Sachs or Accenture, or maybe the World Bank, World Vision or going into an NGO, that at our organisation you can have a bit of everything,” says Mr Bullock. “You can have a challenging career as a consultant and the benefits that go with that. But you can also have an integrated career option that’s gone from being an ad hoc voluntary initiative to being a leadership development programme.”CASE STUDY:Real change not spare change
364;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-11-26T21:23:35Z;The coming price deflation in IT services;;"Here’s food for thought. The average Infosys employee produces roughly the same amount of profit for his or her company in a year as the average worker at Accenture. And that’s in absolute terms, not relative: an engineer hacking out code in Bangalore is adding as much to the corporate bottom line as a consultant in Manhattan, at around $14,000-15,000 a year.This was pointed out to me by Infosys chief financial officer V Balakrishnan, who stopped by while visiting San Francisco recently. It’s a sign of the considerable leverage in the business model of the Indian services companies (at around $50,000 a year, revenues per employee for Infosys are only 40 per cent those of Accenture, so the parity on profits looks impressive.)There are two ways to look at this. One is that the Accentures and IBMs of the world have ample room to expand their margins. If it brings costs down closer to the level of their Indian rivals, the ""global sourcing"" both are pursuing should fuel profit growth for some time.The other side of the coin is that price deflation could be about to turn scary for the Western IT services firms. The business model of the Indian firms – with healthy profits despite much lower prices – leaves them in a strong position to attack.For now, the Western firms publicly brush off the threat: the Indian firms are stuck with lower-value work, and are not big enough to be a force in many parts of the IT services market. But that is changing fast (Infosys, for instance, plans to add 30,000 workers next year to the 80,000 it already has.) The Indian firms have also been recuiting consultants and other ""front end"" workers in the West to build deeper links with customers there.It may still be the case that noone ever got fired for buying from IBM – but when it comes to future services deals, they might at least get to bargain harder over the price first."

Months later, nothing had happened.The high-tech industry is quick to espouse the benefits of seamless, flexible communication, but videoconferencing is one area where things have failed to live up to the hype. “Videoconferencing has seen spotty use and it has not significantly displaced travel,” says Frank Modruson, CIO for global technology consulting firm Accenture.As the IT sector continues to push its green values, this mismatch between rhetoric and reality is becoming harder to ignore. So why are relatively few people using videoconferencing?Andrew Davis, managing partner at online collaboration market research firm Wainhouse, says the technology is let down by usability. For many people, videoconferences are just too difficult to set up.This is why Nortel is emphasising the services side. “The barrier isn’t the technology. It’s the services wrapper around that technology,” says Dean Fernandes, the company’s general manager of network application services.Nortel is one of several companies getting into a relatively new segment of the videoconferencing market, called telepresence. Specially equipped rooms enable people to appear as if they are sitting across the table, with life-size video representations of remote colleagues in high-definition video.Customers pay to use Nortel’s facilities, which can also handle video filming, enabling the room to double as a production facility for corporate TV, for example. Nortel will also handle post-production tasks such as editing.“I create a service around these technologies,” says Mr Fernandes, explaining that his technicians handle everything. “I can offer a utility model, so it is an operational expense, rather than a capital expense sale.”Accenture, on the other hand, opted for the capital investment route. Mr Modruson said it is installing telepresence systems, creating rooms in Chicago and Frankfurt, and hopes to roll out another 11 cities in the next few months.Accenture is not using the rooms as much as he would like, because it needs more cities to make it a convenient option for more of its workforce.Mr Modruson cites Metcalfe’s Law, named after ethernet inventor Bob Metcalfe, which states that the value of any network is the square of the number of nodes attached to it. This shows why videoconferencing has stalled – and what could help it in the future.While few people use videoconferencing regularly, there seems little point in equipping yourself for it. But theoretically, a critical mass should create a tipping point in the market, encouraging everyone to get involved.Worryingly, however, vast numbers of desktop PCs are already equipped for videoconferencing. Many laptops today come loaded with webcams, and programs such as Skype – and free programs such as Windows Live! Messenger – enable videoconferencing to work even behind firewalls. So is Metcalfe’s law not the whole answer?Another stumbling block is security. Many companies are nervous about allowing video into their networks, warns Joe Burton, CTO of the voice technology group at Cisco.“Companies are still in the process of installing session border controllers so that they know how to allow video stream communication into the network,” he says. Session border controllers help companies create policies governing what types of content are allowed into the network, and who can supply them.But this should not be a barrier to the most likely initial users: far-flung employees on the same company network.These users might further be attracted by stand-alone desktop systems (useful for high-quality conferencing on a budget without worrying about PC software crashing), which are beginning to support high-definition video.The rise of cheap broadband networking means many more videoconferencing installations are running on IP networks as opposed to ISDN lines, which moves pricing away from per-minute models and makes customers less nervous about videoconferencing systems.Revenue for the group of companies that make up the bulk of the videoconferencing market was growing by 34 per cent a year in the second quarter of 2007 – another positive sign.The technology exists, and usability issues are being resolved; the remaining stumbling-block seems to be inertia.“We have a whole campaign going on to encourage people to change,” explains Mr Modruson. “If you flew between Frankfurt and Chicago recently, for example, you’ll get an internal e-mail informing you of the videoconferencing option.”Perhaps, the most important upgrade needed to make videoconferencing work may not be in the network, in a special videoconferencing facility, or even on the desktop. It may be inside users’ heads."
366;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-11-20T13:31:01Z;Perspectives: Why do so many technology projects fail?;;Computer projects fail regularly: a frighteningly large percentage are either late, over budget, do not work or do not deliver what the customer wants.The gory details are rarely publicised, however. Both supplier and supplied have too much at stake in terms of reputation and customer confidence to want to wash their dirty linen in public.However, the court action currently running in London’s technology and construction court between British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB), the claimant, and Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the defendant, is manna from heaven for students of information technology management. If this case doesn’t end up as a classic business school case study, I’ll take out a subscription to BSkyB.Briefly, BSkyB is suing EDS for £709m in damages, claiming it made a “deliberate, cynical and dishonest” sales pitch for a multimillion pound contract to build a customer call centre. EDS intends to defend its position vigorously and the case is expected to run for months.I have no intention of venturing an opinion on who is in the right: that is for the court to decide. But there is no doubt that the project as originally envisaged never worked and the final result is still unsatisfactory.The introductory statements to the court made by both parties provide copybook examples of the adversarial positions taken by each side when a project goes wrong.Briefly, in the summer of 2000 BSkyB needed a new call centre complete with a state-of-the-art customer relationship management system, in part to reduce “churn” among its customers. Bidders for the project were EDS, PwC and the then Arthur Andersen, now Accenture.EDS was chosen on the recommendation of BSkyB’s chief operating officer, but against the advice of BSkyB’s chief technical officer. It started work on the project on a time and materials basis with a baseline budget of £47.6m and a time scale of 18 months. By March the next year, the project had failed.BSkyB blames EDS, whose performance under the prime contract it alleges was “disastrous”.EDS sees things differently: “The negotiations were difficult from the start because Sky, by its own analysis, did not know what it wanted but was determined to arrange things in such a way that it paid as little as possible for whatever it was. The result was a contract under which EDS was to work on a time and materials basis to deliver a system, the specifications for which were yet to be formulated.”The project was redesigned and new deadlines agreed, which were not met. BSkyB then took over the role of systems integrator. Finally, in December 2005, the system built by BSkyB went live at a cost of £262.3m but without all the bells and whistles the broadcaster had hoped for. So it became a prototypical example of its kind: well over time, extravagantly over budget and functionally deficient.The unanswered question, however, is why do big software projects of this kind continue to come to grief? Are lessons never learned?As Michael Gentle points out in a new book*: ”Either a goblin has cast a spell on a whole profession – or that profession is doing something fundamentally wrong.” He thinks the approach IT companies and departments have taken to designing and building systems is flawed.“For IT,” he writes, “building systems was initially modelled on the construction industry, with the IT department the equivalent of a contractor who is supposed to deliver systems on schedule, within budget and to spec.”But, he goes on to argue, building software is not like building houses and the analogy cannot hold. He suggests it is impossible to define an IT project in terms of contractual budgets and schedules – so in his terms, BSkyB and EDS with their £50m-budget and 18-month timescale were on a loser from the start.He writes: “Though long a dream in IT, it is not yet possible – and probably never will be because of human behaviour and the fact that each company is different – to have standard process components with standard costs which can be used to produce a quote and delivery date.”He proposes a different model, which takes account of the unavoidable uncertainties in the software development process. Establishing a partnership between client and vendor – rather than the traditional customer/contractor relationship – where the risks and rewards of the project are shared, should lead to a more realistic cost and timescale scenario.Mr Gentle’s proposals are not wholly new: more a clever synthesis of enlightened IT project management thinking over the past few years.He pays due respect to methodologies such as CMMi, CoBIT, ITIL, Prince 2, while pointing out that, despite their virtues, they are inevitably associated with the construction model of software development.Essentially, what he is arguing for are workable results rather than strict compliance with any development processes. Is he right? The list of failed projects suggests that he is at least on the right track.Knocking down software development rules built up over 50 years may be difficult but, without change, the entertaining but essentially destructive spectacle of companies knocking spots off each other in the courts will continue.* IT Success.

367;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-11-11T18:00:46Z;Record prices net Opec $658bn;;Crude oil revenues for the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are this year set to reach $658bn (€448bn, £315bn), an increase of almost 9 per cent from 2006 levels, as prices reach records and the group starts to reverse last year’s production cuts, according to US government data.The Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the US energy department, estimates that revenues will increase even further in 2008 to a high of $762bn, a 16 per cent rise from this year, driven by continued strength in oil prices and further output increases.The large increase in oil income this year, a five-fold jump since 1998, is helping Opec’s members, including Iran and Venezuela, to flex their political muscles.The gradual climb towards the symbolic $100-a-barrel level is transforming the domestic economies of producer countries, allowing Opec members to go on spending sprees or launch big development projects.It has also created an assertive group of Middle East sovereign wealth funds that have been seeking high-profile acquisitions beyond their borders. “Opec countries are becoming more powerful,” said Mark Spellman, head of energy practice at Accenture, the consultancy firm.Venezuela is now providing subsidised fuel to Londoners and discounted crude oil to Cuba and buying distressed public debt from Argentina. Hugo Chávez, the leftwing Venezuelan president, is also spending on social projects at home, which has contributed to his popularity.For Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadi-­Nejad, the oil surge has been a boon, helping him to withstand the impact of United Nations and US sanctions – the principal western pressure tool to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. The prospects of continued strength in the market is also likely to give him the confidence to pursue his populist economic policies and secure voters’ loyalty as the country heads towards a crucial parliamentary poll next year.However, what has helped Iran could hinder Saudi Arabia, whose government runs high economic and geopolitical risks as oil prices mount. It puts Riyadh under greater pressure from Washington to raise output and complicates the pursuit of a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear issue – the main challenge facing the Gulf region.Extra oil revenues have allowed the kingdom in recent years to clean up its finances and pour money into internal security, helping government forces in the fight against al-Qaeda.However, a further increase in the oil price would run against the Saudi desire to maintain market stability, and bring the risk that a recession in consuming economies could undermine demand for oil.Brad Bourland, head of research at Riyadh-based Jadwa Investment, said the Saudis wanted prices at a level that would not harm the world economy or stimulate too much investment in alternative energy. “No one wants oil prices to rise so much that they then collapse,” he said.Vera de Ladoucette, senior director in Paris at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consultancy, said: “Saudi Arabia is very concerned about prices above $80 a barrel.”The jump so far this year in the average price for crude oil has boosted Opec’s income well above initial projections, according to figures by the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies. The CGES estimates that in 2007 Opec will earn about $90bn, or 21 per cent, more than estimated at the beginning of the year because of rising oil prices.The cartel’s crude oil basket will average $66 a barrel in 2007, about $15 more than CGES forecast at the beginning of the year.In 2006, the Opec basket averaged $61 a barrel. The CGES estimates Opec total revenues in 2007, excluding Angola, at $530bn.Saudi Arabia’s 2007 oil income is set to be 19 per cent higher than forecast at the beginning of the year, thanks to both higher prices and production. Iranian and Venezuelan oil revenues will be 16 per cent and 8 per cent higher than estimated.
368;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-11-07T02:55:17Z;e-Recruitment: Computer says: ‘You’re fired’;;"While many companies have adopted e-recruitment techniques, posting jobs on the web, the benefits of e-firing are known to fewer businesses.The practice may sound chilling, but – as many who have worked in a shrinking organisation might testify – software could hardly do a worse job than some managers.E-firing software is particularly helpful to managements in the event of a merger or acquisition, where part of the logic of the deal is that the combined businesses will need fewer staff. By using software, the process can be speeded up so that the best staff do not leave while uncertainty hangs over the business.According to Accenture, a one-month delay in working out which jobs to cut could reduce the net present value of expected cost savings of $500m a year by more than $150m in a company with a 10 per cent cost of capital.But delays are common because of the complexity and emotion involved in working out who should stay and who should go. That is why Vurv,
a human resources software company based in Jacksonville, Florida, decided to add web-based systems Optimize and Workforce Monitor to its product portfolio.They are, it says, designed to “help businesses align financial and organisational objectives through employee rationalisation events, including but not limited to mergers and acquisitions, redeployments, reductions . . . and ordinary . . . terminations”.Vurv gained the two products when it acquired the assets of US-based People Business Network earlier this year. By linking to other business applications, such as payroll and the human resources database, Optimize puts all the important data in one place for senior managers to slice and dice.Samantha Hanson, vice president of human resources at Vurv, says: “Previously, every time I’ve done a restructuring, the chief financial officer has his spreadsheets, human resources have theirs and legal are looking at another. They’re not looking at the same thing.“Moreover,” she adds “when the chief executive changes the amount of money he wants to save, the numbers have to be crunched again and it is very difficult to get all the spreadsheets to match up.”But Vurv’s sofware enables merger candidates to set up an event, such as a merger or acquisition, and a goal, such as how much they want to reduce the headcount by. Or what skills they want to end up with in the combined business.“You can look at your workforce in a variety of ways including by tenure, performance, pay, age, geography or business unit. Or you can look at a combination of factors, such as sales by business unit or by length of service, or the success of applicants hired by one particular recruiter,” says Ms Hanson.“So you can see very quickly what it will cost to close a whole unit and if it will disproportionately affect a group of employees such as women or ethnic minorities, which could lead to legal cases or an unbalanced workforce.”Vurv are keen to stress their software is not just about reducing headcount, but also helps to identify top performers or employees suitable for retraining. In a study of 40 M&A deals by management consultants Bain & Co, it found that in 15 deals classified as successful, nearly every acquirer identified key employees for retention during due diligence or within 30 days of the announcement. This only happened in one third of the unsuccessful deals."
369;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-11-01T22:51:16Z;Long road ahead before Mifid makes impact;;Anyone working in financial risk and compliance could perhaps have hoped for a break after the high-pressure run-up to the introduction on Thursday of Mifid, the Markets In Financial Instruments Directive. But if so, it seems they were mistaken.Ask “what’s next” and you are met with a host of responses ranging from compliance teams still scrambling to implement Mifid itself, through to those who are considering what competitive opportunities it will bring. There are some who want to see the directive extended to other asset classes. And that’s all before they mention the other regulatory changes looming large on the horizon.A number of countries, most notably Spain, are behind in introducing Mifid, meaning many of their domestic institutions are also behind schedule.“The biggest thing now is the need for institutions to complete their plans, stabilise their infrastructure and get a sense of business as normal,” says Stephen Christie, lead partner for regulatory and risk management at Ernst & Young. “Next is figuring out how to work in a Mifid world.”Anyone looking for a sudden big bang change in the financial world, such as London went through in the mid-1980s, will be disappointed. “It will take six to nine months for the real impact to be seen, or longer,” says Anthony Kirby, head of regulation and compliance at Accenture.Mr Kirby expects some bank clients will start questioning the price at which banks sell products – and monitoring these trades more aggressively. This could create clashes, not least because more investment banks are paying relatively little attention to the issue of Mifid in the area of structured finance. “Mifid will open up the means for more investors to challenge their brokers,” he says.Working in a “Mifid world” will take up increasing amounts of time as companies consider how to take advantage of the new cross-border opportunities the directive might offer. Consultants say that in spite of the relentless discussion about Mifid, few have really considered this aspect.“If you go to a classic Mifid conference, everyone is giving nice presentations about what it means, but we’re not seeing much in the way of big strategic thinking,” says Nader Farahati, a consultant at Oliver Wyman. “A lot of senior executives regard Mifid as old hat because they wrote a cheque for it a while back, but they have not really thought it through in terms of possible strategic impact.”The work is not over for regulators either. Eddy Wymeersch, chair of the Committee of European Securities Regulators, says that the group still has work to do on standardising the way national regulators apply the rules and in making cross-border work between them more efficient.“The work of CESR’s members in this area has significantly shifted from a focus on providing technical advice …to a greater emphasis on practical supervisory and operational issues,” he says.There have also been suggestions that Mifid itself might get extended to other asset classes. But senior Commission officials have indicated that they are deeply reluctant to consider this for at least a couple more years – if at all.They argue that the sheer complexity of the project, coupled with the heavy costs, means that it would be better to have a period of “consolidation” before embarking on additional upheaval. “We need to have a period where we consolidate and catch our breath,” says one senior official.The Commission has already launched one study to look into the possibility of extending the directive into the credit market, which is expected to produce conclusions next year. David Wright, a Commission director overseeing financial services, last week said that it was not clear that there was any evidence of market failure in the wholesale bond markets – implying that there was little incentive to extend Mifid to the wholesale credit universe.However, he added: “In the retail market there is a more uncertain feeling – there is a feeling that some more transparency for investors would be beneficial.”It might all be of benefit to the markets, but financial services businesses have long been complaining of regulatory overload in terms of cost and sheer effort – a problem that only seems likely to get worse (see chart).Looming large is the continued effort to implement Basel II, the risk-based capital requirements for banks. Insurers are beginning to grapple with Solvency II, the sweeping new capital requirements for insurers. Although these are not expected to come into force until 2012, intensive preparation will be needed for the regime which matches the capital that insurers must hold much more closely to the risks they face.More costly still is the efforts to harmonise the European Union’s payments processes and practices (see chart) where the cumulative spend, according to Mr Kirby, is likely to reach more than $6bn and rise rapidly in the next few years.“We’ve seen a shift over the last few years from protecting the financial stability and integrity of a bank towards protecting the client. The next milestone in this respect will be the payment services directive,” said Jan van Rompay at Capgemini, the consultancy.
370;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-10-16T19:21:41Z;Possible offensive increases oil market worries;;Although there may be only minimal disruption to global oil production should ­Turkey launch a military offensive in northern Iraq, the psychological impact on an already nervous market could be much more severe, oil traders warn.They fear it could add several dollars to the geopolitical premium price ahead of peak demand during the winter.Tobias Merath, at Credit Suisse in Zurich, said the fact there was no definite timeline on the Turkish operation, with the military likely to win a year-long authorisation from parliament to launch cross-border operations, only adds to the uncertainty.Iraq’s crude oil production is concentrated in the Shia-dominated south, rather than in the north. The country pumped about 2.2m barrels a day in September and exported about 1.7m b/d. Oil exports from the northern fields were a meagre 220,000 b/d in September, according to traders.Paul Horsnell, of Barclays Capital, said: “This is not about physical crude oil shortages.” However, Mark Spelman, of Accenture, warned that the loss of even a small amount of production could “have a disproportionate impact on the market when, as now, supply and demand is tight”.The wider Iraq insurgency has periodically disrupted, often severely, oil flows in the pipeline linking Kirkuk, the city just outside the ­territory controlled by the Kurdistan Regional Government, to the Mediterranean Turkish port of Ceyhan. Traders say sectarian ­violence poses a bigger threat to exports from the northern oil fields than a Turkish attack.But a cross-border incursion could further jeopardise long-term stability in Iraq, they say, complicating the outlook for global oil supply, which is heavily dependent on the country doubling its production in the next two decades.Kurdistan, the only relatively peaceful Iraq region, has become a magnet for independent oil companies. DNO, a Norwegian company, recently began to pump from its Tawke oilfield, near the Turkish border.The company is pumping just 10,000 b/d, which it sells in the local market, but plans to increase production to 25,000 b/d.
371;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-09-28T21:50:09Z;Europe falls in cautious session;;"European equity markets inched higher this week, help by strength in the financial sector and gains for carmakers.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 0.6 points on Friday, closing almost flat at 1550.89, but its gain over the week was 0.3 per cent. Over the third quarter, the Eurofirst 300 lost 3.4 per cent.Telecoms giant Alcatel Lucent was the biggest gainer of the week, with shares surging by 11.6 per cent to €7.20, on hopes for rapid restructuring after a series of profit warnings which have reduced the share price by half.“The board must now be acutely aware that the merger plans are misfiring and that forceful action is absolutely imperative,” said Dresdner Kleinwort, upgrading its recommendation to “buy” this week. Dresdner believes Alcatel’s management must intensify its restructuring programme and consider accelerated asset disposals, starting with Bell Labs.French IT firm Capgemini gained 4.1 per cent to €43.22 this week after the company’s chief executive said sales at its Kanbay International unit would rise at a “double-digit” pace.A further boost was given after US consulting group Accenture posted strong results. Consulting accounts for 65 per cent of Capgemini’s earnings and Accenture’s results were taken as a positive signal.Analysts said Capgemini was undervalued, with shares trading at their lowest level since 1993, and at a 4 per cent discount to the sector.Aerospace group EADS put in a strong performance this week, gaining 6.1 per cent to €21.56 after selling
12 Airbus A380 superjumbos to British Airways, the
first contract win in almost two years from a new customer. Analysts hope the deal could trigger further contract wins.French brokerage Cheuvreux raised its target price to €30 from €17 and Morgan Stanley analyst Scott Babka, who rates EADS “overweight”, said sales to other carriers could add €3 to his target price of €27.Banks have come under significant pressure in the third quarter, with the sector falling about 9.5 per cent due to onging financial market turmoil. However, the sector saw more bid speculation this week.Nordea Bank rose 6.9 per cent to SKr112.3 following reports that Swedish rival SEB was to buy a 20 per cent stake from the government at SKr138 a share. This led analysts to question if a full bid was likely, as Nordea’s market value is double that of SEB, so the deal would represent a reverse takeover. SEB rose 2.7 per cent over week to SKr209.5.Goldman Sachs suggested the most likely course of action was for Nordea to acquire SEB. Goldman said Nordea could offer a 20 to 30 per cent premium to the current SEB share price as the potential synergies between the two groups would still enhance earnings.In the auto sector, Fiat rose by 5 per cent to
€21.16, while DaimlerChrysler climbed 3.9 per cent to €70.64 and BMW was 3.8 per cent higher to €45.23.OMV, the Austrian oil group, was one of the week’s biggest losers, sliding 7.8 per cent to €45.83 after it said it was ready to offer Ft32,000 per share to buy the remaining 80 per cent of MOL, the Hungarian gas group, it does not already own."
372;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Control of the supply chain turns critical;;"An efficient supply chain is a prize worth striving for. According to Accenture, the consultancy firm, “supply chain leadership” can increase a company’s market capitalisation by between 7 and 26 per cent above the industry average.But for a business, even competing for that prize demands a significant investment in resources. In sectors such as consumer goods and retailing, established companies have already achieved the easiest supply chain efficiencies.“Things that are likely to move the dial have to make a significant difference, rather than be technology experiments,” says Stephen Proud, a partner in Accenture’s supply chain practice.None the less, an efficient supply chain is a must for a widening range of businesses. Fashion, hi-tech and grocery retailers grasped early on the importance of ensuring the right stock reached the right store at the right time.No one wants a warehouse full of summer dresses in October, or indeed shelves of last season’s mobile phones in the run-up to Christmas. But the supply chain is now moving up the agenda in slower-moving sectors such as heavy manufacturing.Effective supply chain management is the only way to make efficient use of global sourcing strategies and especially, the huge manufacturing capacity of China and the Pacific Rim.Although globalisation has reduced production costs in a wide range of sectors, the trend to source components or even finished goods from China and elsewhere has made the supply chain manager’s task far harder.“Our internal systems handle more than 700 suppliers,” says Christian Verstraete, worldwide supply chain expert at Hewlett-Packard. “We have to be able to ex-change messages not just with them, but with their suppliers.”Supply chain managers in many sectors are looking for greater visibility of what is happening in their supply chains and faster access to more accurate data.This means that if there is an unexpected event, be it storms affecting shipping or a production shortfall, companies can divert stocks or bring in alternative suppliers.“Companies are not just asking suppliers why there is a problem with an order,” says Sanjiv Sidu, president of supply chain management software vendor i2. “They are asking: ‘When did you first know, and why did you surprise me?’”In sectors such as retail, supply chain problems lead to “stock outs” or empty shelves, which send customers elsewhere. In heavy or complex manufacturing, supply chain problems can lead to cancelled orders running into billions of dollars, or severe penalties for late delivery.As manufacturers move away from vertically integrated production, the supply chain suddenly becomes critical.“In aerospace and defence, we are 10 years behind the hi-tech or even automotive sectors and how we improve the performance of our supply chain is quite a challenge,” explains Bill Black, chief quality officer at aerospace manufacturer EADS.“The cost of running our supply chain logistics is minor, set against the $100m cost of an aircraft. But the cost of failure is enormous.”About 80 per cent of the cost of an aircraft is accounted for by suppliers and partners,” says Black, making EADS “architects of complex products”.“I need to know if an event can affect our master schedule and that means that I need to know what is happening, not just with my tier one, but with tier four, five or six suppliers.”The increasing demands of customers, as well as the drive to cut supply costs, are causing manufacturing companies in particular to renew their investment in supply chain technologies.But efficient supply chain technology can also open up business opportunities.For Kautex-Unipart, an automotive component manufacturer based in Coventry, in the UK, supplying BMW’s Mini production line with fuel tanks came with an onerous condition attached. The company had to achieve 100 per cent delivery accuracy, matched to BMW’s JIS 5000 manufacturing process.Kautex-Unipart is BMW’s sole tank supplier for the Mini plant at Cowley, in Oxfordshire. It has to supply 250,000 tanks each year, in exactly the order specified by BMW, for each of the 13 tanks used on the Mini car.The tanks even have to be stored the right way round in the shipping containers. If they are not, BMW’s production robots cannot fit them.The company used a photographic identification system, Visidot, from Israeli vendor Image ID to ensure that tanks can only leave Coventry if the order exactly matches BMW’s requirements.“Getting supply wrong is the cardinal sin in the automotive industry,” says Jan Parylo, IT manager at Kautex-Unipart. “But the BMW contract has also brought us benefits. We used to have 24 to 48 hours’ visibility of orders. Now BMW can give us six days. As a result, we have more flexibility in our manufacturing and supply processes.”Visidot is one of a number of new technologies that are helping businesses improve supply chain visibility and the speed at which they collect supply chain data. Others include radio frequency identity (RFID) tags as well as three-dimensional and even colour bar codes.“In the past, for manufacturers [supply chain] visibility stopped at the batch or lot level,” says Krish Mantripragada, head of RFID and Auto-ID solutions at enterprise software vendor, SAP. “But recalls and quality issues are putting a lot of pressure on companies to make their data more granular, and to be able to track single items.”The response to RFID, however, differs from industry to industry. Mr Mantripragada says that interest is greatest in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, aerospace and defence “where complete traceability and product integrity are the priorities”.In other industries, some companies are looking to use RFID to make their supply chains more efficient, but they are finding the costs to be higher than expected. The costs of RFID tags may be heading downwards, but there is far more to a supply chain project than the tags alone.RFID, for example, produces a unique serial number for each product, while conventional tracking systems may be designed just to record a product’s stock code, and assume that each product with the same code is identical.“It is partly an infrastructure problem, with the need to deploy sensors. But the second problem is serialised data management,” says Mr Mantripragada. “Many production processes batch supplies, so business processes need to adapt to handle serialisation.”Business processes that are already designed around items with individual serial numbers often lend themselves best to technologies such as RFID; for others, bar codes or similar scanning technologies might be good enough for some time to come.“We are certainly not wedded to RFID as a technology. If the project is about better serialisation and that could be done as well with coloured dots, that would not be an issue. And there are environments where radio frequency technologies are not applicable,” says Mr Proud at Accenture.For businesses considering their supply chains, the most important step is to look at the business process and how it could be improved, and then pick the technology that fits best.Nick Costides, portfolio manager for UPS Supply Chain Solutions, based in Atlanta, says: “As an express delivery company, barcodes meet our needs. But in the long term, there are opportunities. For example, if every item in a warehouse had an RFID tag, it would make taking physical inventories much easier.”Companies also need to consider how access to item-level data, or indeed more up-to-date status information from the supply chain will support decision making.“Distribution centre operators clearly have different needs from C-level executives,” says Mr Costides. “We give them the information they want to see, so they are not overwhelmed.”Fortunately, modern enterprise IT systems have the capacity to handle the increased data coming in from systems such as RFID. But technologists caution against relying on a single change to improve supply chain performance.“There is not one killer application but rather a series of incremental steps before we see the ground shift,” says SAP’s Mr Mantripragada. “Some customers have seen significant returns on investment from better data accuracy and visibility, but no two customer scenarios are the same.”"
373;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-09-17T11:13:05Z;Engineers get management skills;;Audencia, the French business school based in Nantes, is opening up its Masters in Management degree, ranked eight in the FT 2007 rankings, to students from other disciplines, initially those at engineering schools but eventually to students from arts or design backgrounds, such as architects.Instead of the final year of their engineering degree, selected students will be able to study management at Audencia for 18 months and finish their studies with two degrees, one in engineering and one in management. The 18 months will include a company internship.Jean Charroin director of the Audencia Master in Management (Grande Ecole programme) says the management element is intended for those engineers who want to run engineering operations or work in general management or marketing, rather than those who want to work in research and development.The three engineering schools already enlisted are Ecole Centrale de Nantes, Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécoms de Brest and IFP - the French Petroleum Institute. Next month Prof Charroin expect to sign up a number of corporate partners, including Air France and Accenture.www.audencia.com
374;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-07-12T18:54:27Z;Total’s ‘good partner’ strategy vindicated;;"Gazprom’s decision to choose Total as its first foreign partner in the development of the Shtokman field is a vindication of the French company’s strategy of being a “good partner” in the countries where it operates.Total has only minimal experience in Russia, and no experience at all in the Arctic conditions that make Shtokman so challenging, yet it has been allowed to take a 25 per cent stake in exploiting the world’s second-biggest gas field: a hugely important asset.The other two groups in the race could win all or part of the 24 per cent stake in the project that Gazprom said is still potentially available.But it is Total’s position that has been assured first.Gazprom declined to comment on why it had chosen Total, but analysts said it was always likely that a European company would have been its first choice of partner.Mark Spelman of Accenture, the consultancy, said: “The Americans are out of favour for this sort of deal. Other European companies such as Eon and Eni have been doing deals with Gazprom, and Total was the obvious one not yet in the mix.” As one of the world’s top five international oil companies, the “super-majors”, Total also brings a greater financial strength to the project than its rivals can muster.One person familiar with the situation said that was an important consideration in the deal: Gazprom felt it could buy in whatever technology it needed, but wanted partners to share the risks of developing such a large project.Stephen Dashevsky, head of research at Aton Capital in Moscow, said: “Statoil or Norsk Hydro is a large company by European standards, but by Shtokman standards, Gazprom may have thought that it needed a real super-major as partner.”Some of Total’s know-how will be relevant: it is experienced in deep-water production, and growing fast in liquefied natural gas, which is to be part of the Shtokman development; Gazprom hopes to be shipping LNG from the project in 2014.Above all, however, the great advantage for Total may have been its willingness to compromise.The person familiar with the deal said Total had won favour particularly because of its flexible approach and willingness to take part in the special purpose vehicle that will be set up to develop the field, without taking part directly in sales of the gas.That fits with Total’s general approach, which contrasts markedly with the typical behaviour of US or even British companies. Where others might come to a country and seek to impose a particular way of doing business, Total is prepared to listen and adapt to local conditions.This approach has helped Total do business in Saudi Arabia and Bolivia, for example. In Venezuela, where ExxonMobil and Conoco walked away from heavy oil upgrader projects rather than accept new terms from president Hugo Chávez, Total was one of the companies that stayed.Critics have argued that its strategy gives too much away. But its relative strength outside the developed world, where almost all the growth in world oil and gas production is coming, has put Total in a much better position for growth than its super-major peers.In May Christophe de Margerie, Total’s chief executive, reaffirmed his expectation that the company’s oil and gas production would grow by an average of 5 per cent a year between 2006 and 2010: better than Royal Dutch Shell, BP, or even Exxon, the acknowledged industry leader. Speaking to the Financial Times recently, Yves-Louis Darricarrère, Total’s head of exploration and production, said oil companies today had to learn to accept the consequences of resource nationalism.This meant increasing a company’s contribution to local communities and using more local suppliers, for example, as well as recognising that sometimes the agreements of 15-20 years ago might have favoured the multinationals.But this did not mean the end of profits for oil companies.Additional reporting by Peggy Hollinger"
375;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-07-11T08:40:50Z;Where do we go from here?;;It is easy these days to be overtaken by the future. Take e-mail, for example, the mainstay of modern business communication: “Younger people see e-mail as something older people do,” grimaces Don Rippert, chief technology officer for Accenture, the world’s largest consultancy.“I thought it was a novel, next generation technology, but to young people it’s: ‘You should post to my site on MySpace [a social networking website], you should text message me, you should instant message me, why would you want to e-mail me? I don’t even check my inbox any more’.”Indeed, the Gartner Group predicts that by 2011, instant messaging will be the de facto tool for voice, video and text communications in business. By then, of course, the young will have moved on to something else – refinements of the imaginary worlds of Second Life and other “virtual worlds”, or metaverses, perhaps.Sometimes our technological future and our traditional present even collide, with risible results. “I will pay with my phone,” Tero Ojampera, Nokia’s chief technology officer, declared as he ordered coffee in a branch of McDonald’s, the fast food chain, expecting to be able to wave his handset over a wireless card reader. His waitress was unimpressed: “We don’t accept phones as payment,” she sniffed dismissively.Such misunderstandings aside, near field communications (NFC), a short range (hand’s width) wireless technology, looks set to turn mobile handsets into electronic wallets and could revolutionise the way we pay for goods and services within the foreseeable future. Prototypes already exist and trials are under way, underlining a truism about forecasting technological futures: what we can reliably predict already exists, at least in the laboratory.Beyond that, according to Andy Mulholland, chief technology officer at Capgemini, Europe’s largest computing services group, other factors cloud the issue: “I have a formula about where technology takes us. For a year ahead, you can be confident about where it is going because betas [prototypes in test] and alphas [finished designs] for the products which are going to come out already exist.“For three years to five years ahead you have people collecting requirements definitions for the releases beyond that. Beyond five to 10 years, you might have an idea of what could come out of the laboratories. But from 10 to 20 years ahead, your only guidance is demographics: what people have grown up with and what they see as normal.”So for this article, we will stick with the foreseeable and practical rather than the blue yonder. Inevitably, an expert’s view of the future is coloured by his or her area of expertise – Mr Ojampera looks forward to mobile handsets fabricated in new materials that would enable them to be bent or stretched, while Mr Mulholland anticipates technologies based on communications and interaction rather than today’s transaction-based approach.But overall, this straw poll of some of the IT industry’s leading experts reflects a thoughtful, rather downbeat view of the future rather than the technocratic, gung-ho self-assurance of earlier years.Many were concerned about personal privacy and security in a world where miniature video cameras would be ubiquitous and failure to safeguard sensitive data could open individuals and companies to legal action. “E-mail, voicemail and text messages used to be ethereal,” says Mike Lynch, chief executive of the UK company, Autonomy. “But no longer. Now you can see them being brought up in court.”Crispin O’Brien, chairman of the technology group at consultancy KPMG, while questioning whether fixed line telephones have a future, worried about the mobile alternative: “There are huge, huge risks in mobile working,” he says. “If you leave a laptop on the back seat of a car, you could be in breach of all sorts of confidentiality issues.”He argued that business was remiss to “just hunker down behind the firewall” – the defensive barrier at the perimeter of the business – rather than working out how to guard BlackBerrys – devices offering mobile e-mail and more – from eavesdroppers. “Mobile working and devices such as the BlackBerry require a new approach to security,” he says. The French security service’s recent decision to ban BlackBerrys from the president and prime minister’s offices underlines the point.Mobility is clearly a challenge and opportunity. Mr Ojampera of Nokia thought the principal underlying trend would be the merging of mobility and Web 2.0 – shorthand for the latest iteration of the World Wide Web that emphasises interactivity and shared experiences: “Communities of people sharing experiences combined with a very intelligent mobile device which ‘knows’ your location will bring a completely new type of interactivity.”He predicted in three or four years the emergence of mobile devices with visual recognition technology linked to intelligent databases. A tourist in London for example, could point their mobile phone at the Houses of Parliament. The phone would recognise the image and provide a commentary – perhaps spelling the beginning of the end for the tour guide?Mr Ojampera also argued the next iteration of the internet would be created around mobile rather than the fixed computers. Each individual’s mobile device would become a web server in its own right with other internet users given specific rights to access the content.According to Mike Lynch of Autonomy, the emergence of the first elements of Web 2.0 such as YouTube and MySpace and other social networking sites represents the biggest change in the IT industry since its formation.Instead of simplifying the material world so that it can be handled by computers, people now expect computers to be able to cope with human-friendly information: “Rather than us being slaves to what the computer needs, the computer will have to follow what we like.”The cause, of course, is the explosion of unstructured information and Mr Lynch, as head of a company that specialises in the management and retrieval of such information, is in no doubt about the complexity of dealing with it: “No one is going to be able to tag every piece of information and knowledge, even if they agreed on how the tags are defined. It’s a case of the hype getting ahead of the reality.”Important information will, however, be tagged with metadata and made easily accessible. Andrew Herbert, head of Microsoft’s Cambridge laboratories, argues that computers will increasingly become a prothesis for civilisation’s overburdened memories: “The computers will know who you work with and show you things before you need them.“So if you usually interact with certain documents while you have the monthly accounts open, then the computer might go ahead and get those documents ready for you in case you need them. It will be a sort of intelligent pre-search function – in search, we’re moving on from searching on key words to searching for concepts and the technology behind this is machine learning.”There is broad agreement that there will be fundamental changes to ways of working. Don Rippert of Accenture points to an increase in the use of contractors – people employed for specific projects – and ways of substituting for today’s centralised workforces: “Having people drive through traffic for an hour to get to work will become unacceptable.”“Increasingly, we will have to find ways for a distributed workforce to collaborate across time and distance,” he says, arguing that the latest, highly realistic videoconferencing systems would play a part, as would elements of Web 2.0: “Look at how teenagers use computers and the internet. They seem to be able to collaborate with each other with no effort whatsoever.”He argues that derivatives of consumer products such as MySpace could be used in an enterprise setting. It was already happening in an informal way: “If you put SOA into a keyword search in YouTube [a video-sharing website] you will get video after video about service oriented architecture” – hardly regarded as a popular topic on teenage-orientated websites.Crispin O’Brien of KPMG agrees that the elements of Web 2.0 – something he called Enterprise 2.0, or social networking in a business context – would be significant: “The more you can network people in an informal way, the more value a company can create,” he says.He also argues that computers have to behave more like humans and that the next phase of workplace IT could be as influenced by social anthropology as by writers of computer code.John Gage, chief researcher for Sun Microsystems, combines the sinister and social potential of technological progress in pointing out that, in his view, the big issue is the conjunction of the identity of people, objects, programs and data with location.“Couple Google’s plans to map the surface of the Earth to an accuracy of 20cm with global positioning systems – which means the position of the 2bn-3bn existing mobile devices could be located to within a metre – with IPV6 [the latest internet protocol that allows for a virtually unlimited number of internet addresses and therefore objects connected to the internet] and we have the makings of a police state as well as incredible logistical power. We would know the location of every package, truck, container vehicle and traffic jam.”In fact, with the latest storage and processing technologies, the capability is almost here to record every incident in an individual’s life. But is that something to which we should aspire, the experts ask?Some corners of every life are best left dark. Indeed, bloggers are already being warned that their words ay come back to haunt them in later life in applying for jobs or promotion.
376;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-06-25T03:39:54Z;Western IT consultancies take the fight to India;;When Hurricane Katrina ravaged the US Gulf Coast two years ago, among the first outsiders to have an inkling of the extent of the disaster were a group of computer engineers in Bangalore.Employees of IBM, who were managing computer networks for clients in the US from the Indian city, were assailed by thousands of alerts on the giant screens in their “command centre” as the storm wiped out systems half the world away. “That’s a lot of red dots,” said Pete Lorenzen, who runs IBM’s infrastructure outsourcing business in India.Since that event, one of several that helped to underline the value of its Indian outsourcing operation, the world’s largest technology services company has rapidly built up its presence in the subcontinent. Today India is IBM’s biggest centre by headcount outside of the US, with more than 53,000 employees.The strategy is not isolated to IBM. As India emerges as the undisputed low-cost hub for global outsourcing, all of the leading western information technology services companies are setting up operations in the country on an unprecedented scale. India is this year expected to become the biggest employment base for Accenture, the global IT consultancy, and the biggest within the next one or two years for Capgemini, the leading European computer services consultancy.The eastward migration of the IT services giants is challenging the predominance of India’s aggressive domestic companies on their home turf, opening a new chapter in the battle for control of an industry worth $1,500bn globally last year. “If you look five years from now at the big five global companies, who are they going to be? That’s the game right now,” says Salil Parekh, head of Capgemini in India. “That’s why everyone is scaling up offshore.”For India, the outcome of this struggle will be critical. The IT outsourcing and IT-enabled services sector has become an important driver of the country’s economy, generating about $48bn ($24bn, €36bn) in annual sales last year, according to Nasscom, the industry body.Most of the global technology services companies have had a small presence in India for years, many of them for decades. But it was not until the Y2K boom in the late 1990s that they began to stand up and take notice of the country’s potential. India’s homegrown computer services outsourcing companies were able to prepare western clients’ IT systems for the so-called “millennium bug” at a fraction of the cost of their global peers.The Indian companies, led by such names as Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro, went on to capture more and more lower-end business in developed markets, writing software for banks, providing IT support for foreign retail chains and managing foreign computer networks. They also moved further into “business process outsourcing”, an area ranging from the handling of truck leasing for US logistics companies to writing legal briefs for foreign law firms.With their expensive operations in the west, the global technology services companies began to lose market share at the low end of the business to more nimble Indian rivals. They had no choice but to start migrating some of their business to India.Among the first to see the benefits was Accenture, which has had operations in the country since 1985. Essentially a high-end business strategy consultancy, Accenture has also begun pushing into the Indians’ stronghold of low-cost project work for foreign clients. Accenture calls this strategy, ominously for Indian operators, “defend and extend”.Others, such as IBM, were regarded by analysts as slower off the mark. But in recent years, the group has begun to obtain critical mass in India. In 2004, it bought a business process outsourcing unit and in 2005 it acquired a network management business. It then began a recruitment drive, last year alone hiring more than 1,000 people a month.Most of IBM’s global business units are now represented in India and the company has begun to target more closely India’s emerging domestic technology services market. IBM has also boosted its research division in India, putting some of its best minds to work at improving the so-called “global delivery model”, the process by which outsourcing companies in India provide services to clients overseas.Among the research division’s innovations was voice recognition technology that filters applicants for call centre or business process outsourcing positions based on their presentation skills over the phone, says Guruduth Banavar, programme director of IBM’s services innovation and research centre in Bangalore.But the attempt to match the Indian companies at their own game is viewed with scepticism by some. For a start, global companies are still burdened with armies of expensive consultants in developed markets, while their Indian peers draw heavily on locals in their mid-20s whose salaries, while rising, are still well below their overseas rivals. “Indian companies are starting from a low cost and working out. Western IT consultancies are starting from a high cost and moving low cost,” says Egidio Zarrella, a partner at KPMG.The Indian IT outsourcing companies may still be tiny compared to their western adversaries – the biggest, TCS, had annual sales of $4.3bn last financial year, slightly less than Accenture’s quarterly sales. But while the Indian companies’ market share is currently only about 5 per cent, this has risen fivefold in three years.Says Nandan Nilekani, executive chairman of Infosys, the second-largest Indian outsourcer: “It’s not about size, it’s about the future, it’s about who’s got momentum, it’s about new business models replacing old business models. We are growing at a compounded rate of 40 per cent and the legacy players are growing at 5-6 per cent.”Indian companies argue that western consultancies, particularly front-end salespeople, have a cultural dislike for outsourcing. “They will always see India as just a back office,” says S Ramadorai, TCS chief executive. “But for us this is the mainstream.”The western companies retort that their Indian rivals are still largely confined to the middle to lower end of the business. The Indians are barely present in business strategy consulting, the industry’s most lucrative work, in which consultancies will help a retailer such as Wal-Mart to set up a supply chain management system or a telecoms company to roll out a billing system. “On the consulting side, I do believe it will be a long time before they [the Indians] reach the dining table,” says Kris Wadia, a senior executive at Accenture.With both sides trying to invade each other’s territory, some wonder why there has not yet been a large-scale merger between an Indian company and a western consultancy. The Indian companies have the currency. Infosys’ sales may be a fraction of those of Accenture but its market capitalisation is about $31bn, compared with the US company’s $23bn.“The IT industry hasn’t had a breakthrough acquisition yet and that is something that should happen,” says Pradeep Udhas, a partner at KPMG.
377;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-06-05T23:28:50Z;Dell plans purchases to build services;;Michael Dell is planning a series of acquisitions to turn Dell into more of a computer services business, as he struggles to boost sales and margins at the world’s second-biggest personal computer maker.Mr Dell, co-founder and chief executive, on Tuesday told the Financial Times that the company’s services business was growing faster than sales of computer equipment, and represented a “huge opportunity”.“That growth will come not just from organic growth but also partnerships and acquisitions. We made a small acquisition in Scotland, which has worked out quite well, and I think you will see some more acquisitions to add capability to our services team,” he said.The comments came days after Dell announced it was slashing 10 per cent of its workforce in a cost-cutting drive designed to help put the company back on track after a string of missteps.“Michael Dell knows the company has got to change,” said Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner. “[Using] services to sell hardware is something that makes a lot of sense for Dell.”Services offered by Dell could include helping companies install new equipment and running an IT helpdesk for staff.Mr Dell said only about $6bn of Dell’s $60bn annual revenues came from services.Rivals such as Hewlett-Packard and IBM have spent the past several years building up their services businesses to serve the computing needs of big companies. Many companies find services attractive because they are more profitable than hardware sales.Mr Reynolds said Dell was more likely to begin making small acquisitions to grow its existing services portfolio, rather than attempt the acquisition of a more specialised computer services company such as Accenture.But Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies, said Dell might be interested in a bigger deal.“In the past, Dell has wanted to remain lean and mean,” said Mr Kay. “Now they’re looking at it differently and saying: ‘We need to get this capability under our roof’.”Dell said recently it would begin selling through Wal-Mart stores and third-party resellers in addition to its direct sales over the telephone and internet. Mr Dell also indicated that the company could be expanding its range of own-branded stores beyond two experimental US outlets.Dell is also thought to be winding down a foray into Dell-branded televisions that began in 2003. The Bloomberg news service reported on Tuesday that Dell could stop selling its televisions as early as this month. A Dell spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the report.

379;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;The world in 2020;;"Being asked to discuss ""the world in 2020"" without hesitation, deviation or massive banality is a difficult task at the best of times. It is an even more daunting when you are expected to perform at 7.45 in the morning. But that was the fate that befell me this morning, when I took part in a seminar organised by the Centre for European Reform, a think tank and Accenture, a consultancy.Fortunately, the hard work had been done by Mark Leonard, who has just been appointed as the head of a new think tank – the astutely-titled European Council on Foreign Relations, which is being funded by George Soros. Leonard – whose stock-in-trade is to think BIG – has just produced a new pamphlet called ""Divided World: The struggle for primacy in 2020"". You can find a summary of its argument here; and if you feel inspired to buy it, try here.The pamphlet attempts to describe the new multipolar world that will exist in 2020. It notes that in that year ""the Chinese economy could overtake the US to become the largest in the world, measured by PPP"" – and it takes the obligatory pot-shot at Fukuyama’s ""end of history thesis"".Leonard argues that – pace Fukuyama – the world has not seen the end of ideological competition. He sees four emerging poles of ideological competition – ""the US which will seek a balance of power that favours democracy; China and Russia, which will use international law to protect autocracies from external influence; the EU, which will favour a world of democratic states bound by the laws of multilateral institutions; and the Middle East, which will become a faith zone, governed neither by democracy nor the rule of law.""Any argument of this nature is inevitably over-schematised. But Leonard’s is still one of the more interesting and ambitious efforts to describe what a ""multipolar world"" will look like.In my own rather rambling commentary (it was early), I argued that Leonard was too optimistic about Europe and too credulous about Chinese ""soft power"". I also tried to relate what Leonard had to say to the every-day news events that fill the papers in 2007. It seems to me that – even by 2020 – the aftermath of the Iraq catastrophe is still likely to shape the world. America’s global standing and its attitude to key questions like the use of force and the spread of democracy are going to depend a great deal on how badly the Iraq venture ends.Things aren’t looking good at the moment. But Peter David – the foreign editor of The Economist, who was also there – made a plea to consider the resilience of American society and government. He reckoned America will still be top dog – by a distance – in 2020.A lot of the business people in the room were more sceptical. Mark Spelman of Accenture argued that American, Japanese and European assumptions that they will continue to monopolise innovation and R&D are likely to be proven false fairly swiftly, as the emerging Asian economies move rapidly to develop their own poles of innovation and expertise. Spelman argued that a shortage of scientific talent in the west means that big companies are going to ""source talent globally"". This will benefit a global elite, but hit the unskilled.Combine an American defeat in Iraq, with rising economic inequality associated with globalisation – and what do you get. I would say a resurgence of isolationism and protectionism – which will kick in well before 2020."
380;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-04-18T18:23:01Z;Hitachi woos European IT consultants;;Life is tough for the medium-sized UK IT consultancy. Last week another one of them – Impact Plus – sought shelter in the arms of a bigger Japanese suitor, Hitachi of Japan.Impact is one of a long line of independent consultancies that have been acquired by foreign companies. The Indian IT consultancies Tata, Wipro and Infosys have been making small deals to consolidate their foothold in the market.David Bailey, the co-founder of Impact Plus, who now becomes head of Hitachi’s UK operations, told the FT that before the deal, he had struggled for four years to move the consultancy beyond the £10m turnover bracket.The company lacked the brand power and financial clout to go after really big deals, found it too expensive to make its own acquisitions, and failed to find attractive-enough offers from venture capital backers. It was either stagnation or a deal with the Japanese.There is already a big line-up of foreigners in European IT consulting. The Indians are the newer arrivals, while the Americans such as EDS, CSC, Accenture and IBM have been in the market for years. Hitachi’s compatriot Fujitsu has been active in Europe since 1990, when it took majority control of UK’s ICL. Europe is an attractive market for foreign IT consultancies as there is still a lot of scope for businesses to improve IT efficiency. Using IT to increase competitiveness is a key theme for the European Commission. The UK in particular has seen huge public sector IT projects such as the £12bn NHS IT revamp. Local government is also generating a huge amount of work as local councils try to meet government savings targets by combining their back office systems.Mr Bailey said there would be several more acquisitions, with an aim to making Hitachi’s European operations a 500 person, $100m turnover business in the next two and a half years. That is going to mean a lot of growth from 120 employees today.The next deals are likely to be in France and Germany where there is little or no business yet. The small toe-hold the company has in Spain and Portugal will also be expanded.
381;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-04-02T21:19:48Z;Olympic glory at bargain prices;;Companies are securing the benefits of Olympic exposure in the 2012 London games for a bargain price by striking deals directly with individual sports.Norwich Union, Man Group, Siemens and Accenture are among the companies who have gone straight to the bodies running athletics, sailing, rowing and hockey to agree sponsorship.But most are for a maximum of a few million pounds – in stark contrast to the £80m spent by Lloyds TSB, the bank, on an official, top tier local partnership with Locog, the games organiser.In some cases sponsors have signed longer deals than the typical four-year span in order to extend relationships up to and beyond the 2012 games. The distinct feature of the deals is that they either involve sponsors new to the sports or more money than the agreements they replace.None of the sponsors that have gone down this alternative route has yet gone on to sign an official deal with Locog. However, the organiser says that the trend is not unusual and does not undermine the “strong” commercial interest in its official partnerships.Official Locog partners have marketing rights to the Olympics, Paralympics and official Team GB selection from the moment they sign. This could allow them to reap the benefits of association over three games: Beijing in 2008, Vancouver’s Winter Olympics in 2010 and London 2012.However, the number of UK companies seen as able to afford a seven-figure top Locog partnership is small, though overseas groups can also apply. And only one bidder will be the top partner in each of up to nine industry categories that Locog hopes to sell.In contrast, those striking partnerships with sports directly will benefit from the association with individual teams or athletes emerging as potential 2012 medal contenders – in return for a far smaller and more manageable investment.Jeremy Clark, a regional managing director of MEC Sponsorship, the media agency, said: “Not only is there desire for Olympic rights at the right and realistic prices, but also increased commercial interest in Olympics sports that can gain companies implicit association with the London Olympics.”Both Norwich Union and Alfa Romeo, the athletics sponsors, had paid significantly more than the rights had gone for on previous occasions, he said. “Relatively minor sports such as gymnastics, hockey and rowing have attracted substantial new investment.”Industry experts believe Locog’s target of raising about £750m from sponsorship is an ambitious yet achievable goal. Nevertheless, companies are wary of committing huge sums unless they believe they can reap substantial marketing benefits.Like most sponsors, Locog partners will also have to spend heavily on follow-up marketing to realise maximum value from their deals.Sponsoring the Olympics is also more complex than many sports sponsorships in which advertisers are essentially paying for the chance to reach television and live audiences in the context of an emotionally compelling event. Olympic sponsors do not get their brands on stadium hoardings or interview backdrops.Chris Townsend, commercial director of Locog, said it remained confident there would be sufficient opportunities for top sponsors to benefit. He added Locog had signed its first top tier partner at an earlier stage than previous games organisers.However, Media forecasters at GroupM, part of Sir Martin Sorrell’s WPP marketing services group, are taking a conservative approach to predicting the timing of Locog 2012 deals.GroupM projects about £200m of Locog sponsorships will be signed this year, with another £200m in 2008. It had earlier estimated that £400m would be spent this year.Adam Smith, futures director at GroupM, said: “We still believe Locog will get the money. It’s just the phasing will be different.”
382;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-03-28T09:13:51Z;The future of search: It’s how, not where, you look;;"The time staff waste searching for “stuff” – the information necessary to do their jobs more effectively – has become legendary. Accenture, the consultancy, polled more than 1,000 executives in the US and UK and found that managers were on average spending up to two hours – a quarter of their working day – searching for stuff.When they found it, moreover, at least 50 per cent was useless: irrelevant, out-of-date or just wrong.Concerned that its intranet was becoming overburdened, BAE Systems, the aerospace group, carried out its own survey and discovered that four out of five employees on the network were wasting an average of 30 minutes a day retrieving information while 60 per cent were spending an hour or more duplicating the work of others.The solution was a system from Autonomy, a UK company which, with 16,000 customers worldwide, leads the market for what is known as “enterprise search”, a family of technologies that make it possible to extract information quickly from both structured and unstructured sources. With the Autonomy system in place, BAE estimates that time spent in finding information is down by more than 90 per cent.Another example: lawyers with the US firm Morrison & Foerster found they were drowning in information scattered through their systems: client histories were stored in accounting and customer relationship management systems, documents were stored in a document management system, communications in e-mail servers and so on.The firm drew up a specification for an ideal solution, which it called AnswerBase, and commissioned a system from Recommind, a legal search vendor. Searches which had previously taken hours could be completed in seconds using AnswerBase; those taking days were reduced to minutes.As Craig Carpenter, Recommind’s head of marketing and business development, puts it, the days when enterprise search was a non-essential novelty are past; now the future lies with search technologies which will home in on concepts rather than keywords.Enterprise search is a comparatively recent phenomenon, forced on companies by the internet, e-mail, company intranets and the 20bn gigabytes of new data now being created by businesses each year.Google currently leads the world in conventional internet search but as Mike Lynch, Autonomy chief executive, emphasises, enterprise search is different: “Unlike the internet, enterprise information is in different formats. A large company might support 300 different information formats scattered through 5,000 separate repositories.“An enterprise search engine has to be able to understand all those formats and talk to all those repositories. And most staff are not allowed to see all the information a company has stored away. In a large group, for example, an individual might be allowed to see only one in every 10,000 documents. Each repository has its own set of complex rules governing who is allowed to see what and it is changing all the time.”So Autonomy uses “spiders” and “ants” – intelligent software – to roam the intranet, indexing all the material available for a search: in that sense, even unstructured data has a structure of sorts. Ants are self-learning and capable of appreciating that particular pieces of information are frequently requested or that some categories of information change rapidly. Mr Lynch says attempts to create search tools without overall indexing – known as “federated search” – are unworkable: “They glow red hot and melt.”Tamara Alairys, global leader for search at Accenture, points out that using Google to search a word like “Turkey” will return thousands of hits but it will not distinguish between the country and the bird: “The challenge for people searching their intranets has been to get better search relevancy and to retrieve data that can help them make a better decision.”She argues that search technologies have improved “by leaps and bounds” in the past two years: “Early capabilities were limited: a user could only perform basic keyword searches and sort the results using parameters such as the date of creation. Much more is possible today. Structured and unstructured data can be searched. And natural language processing enables the search engine to understand the intent behind a user’s query and give a meaningful response.”The cost of failing to retrieve relevant data can be high. Zia Zaman, in charge of strategic market development for Fast, a search company based in Oslo, Norway, recalls a pharmaceuticals company that entered into a strategic relationship with a drug delivery group: “The two companies invested years and millions of dollars in trying to figure out how they could work together but in the end they had to pull the plug on the deal. Then the pharmaceuticals company found a document in its own files which detailed how the drug delivery mechanism could never work. They had been making decisions in a fog.”Changes in the legal environment in the US is driving interest in enterprise search. The latest revision of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the code for civil legal action, published in December year, gives companies involved in a lawsuit 99 days to produce relevant information stored electronically compared with three years or so previously.Mike Lynch comments: “This will be impossible for a big drug company or manufacturer unless they already have a system in place. Companies which have some experience of lawsuits have already realised how important this is. Others are just waking up to it. Later this year I would expect to see the first prosecutions resulting from a failure to comply with the requirements.” It is expected that other countries will follow the US lead in principle.Over the past 18 to 24 months there have been significant improvements in search technology, and the number of vendors of enterprise search systems has grown. IBM, Microsoft and Google have offerings aimed at business. The top end of the market is dominated by Autonomy, Convera, Fast and Open Text while specialist players include Endeca, InQuira, Siderean Software and Vivisimo.The result, as Jerome Pesenti of Vivisimo writes, is that the search market is fragmented and confusing but that should not stop companies experimenting: customers don’t know what to ask, what features are needed and which vendors to look at, he notes, going on to argue that search should be seen as a long-term application, deployed quickly and improved in phases based on end-user feedback: “There is no limit as to how good and useful a search can be,” he claims, “but modest goals, early rewards and especially, valuable user feedback, can be obtained through quick deployment.”The BBC has difficult information retrieval needs. It is awash with information: core business systems as well as financial information about programmes, approvals processes, e-mails, audio and video.Keith Little, BBC chief information officer, says: “We have lots of information that is unsearchable – valuable information that nobody can access. We have systems with search facilities but these are silos and then there are e-mails and other repositories of unstructured data that go right across the organisation.”The BBC uses several search tools – Autonomy, Microsoft Sharepoint and OpenText Livelink among them. Mr Little says: “At the top level, our search strategy is to create a framework for plugging in, in a service-oriented manner, legacy and future systems.“We need the ability to put those together to meet the search requirements from the business and we then have to think about how we provide access to our real audience – the people who pay our licence fees.” “Infax”, a simple programme search tool, was made available to the public last year.What lies ahead for enterprise search? Ms Alairys of Accenture sees four developments. First, advanced analytics and monitoring which will make it possible to tap information in real time and provide rapid responses. Second, sentiment analysis which uses textual analysis to gauge the tone of a document – whether results show a company in a positive or negative light, for example. Third, multimedia search across textual, video and audio sources. And fourth, guided information discovery – exploring information without a specific query.So in future, even if you don’t know what you want or where to find it, enterprise search will guide you to the right answer."
383;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-03-19T18:41:55Z;Chicago trio shakes up markets;;"Three publicity-shy Chicago-based groups are emerging as a potent global force in trading across almost all asset classes.The trio use complex technology and mathematical models, often termed “blackbox trading”, to buy and sell in enormous volumes on a daily basis.The three outfits are Citadel, the hedge fund founded in his Harvard dormitory by Ken Griffin; DRW Trading, a 15-year-old company that started out as a Eurodollar options specialist; and Getco, acknowledged as one of the pioneers of electronic trading.Bill Cline, former head of the capital markets practice at Accenture and now managing partner of Acai Solutions, a capital markets consultancy, said the three Chicago groups were part of a broader trend in which hedge funds and proprietary trading outfits provide the market with order flow, liquidity and in some cases take equity stakes in exchanges, as well as trading huge volumes for themselves.“This, and similar moves by others, represent a challenge to the very concept of the exchange because increasingly, everyone can trade directly with everyone else. The hub-and-spoke network does not really stand up any longer,” Mr Cline says.Evidence of the growing influence of the Chicago trio came when they were recently among half a dozen hedge funds and non-bank traders that joined a group lobbying for membership of MTS, the dominant eurozone government bond trading platform.Their efforts have triggered unease among some investment banks, which have exclusive access to the platform and so dominate trading in the €4,000bn ($3,000bn) market. Citadel is perhaps the best known of the Chicago trio, although Mr Griffin himself rarely gives interviews.The fund is believed to account for at least 10 per cent of trading flows on eSpeed and BrokerTec, the electronic bond trading platforms. These two in turn are estimated to account for about two-thirds of trading flows in the most frequently traded Treasury instruments – which total about $300bn a day. In disclosures made late last year, Citadel revealed holdings of more than $30bn of government bonds.With a strategy based to a large extent on high-volume, frequent trading, Citadel is also believed to account for more than 5 per cent of all daily share trading volume on the NYSE and Tokyo Stock Exchanges.The DRW Trading Group describes itself on its website as “an aggressive, dedicated organisation engaged in many different aspects of the trading industry, including market making and proprietary trading”.The three groups are part of a wider movement that is using state of the art technology and applying complex mathematical procedures to dictate their trading patterns or respond to movements across the capital markets.Their ability to transact such large volumes of securities so quickly, which is key to the influence they wield, can be put down at least in part to their use of so-called “programme trading” (see box).Alongside their thriving proprietary trading businesses, Citadel, DRW and Getco also act to varying degrees as marketmakers in a host of instruments and have positioned themselves to take advantage of rapid global changes in market infrastructure by forming alliances with, or investing in, trading platforms and stock and derivatives exchanges.The global exchange landscape is going through unprecedented consolidation. Big deals such as the merger of the NYSE Group and Euronext, the pan-European exchange, have been accompanied by the entry of well-funded new players such as Bats trading and the Level automated trading system.Indeed, Getco is one of the market makers that has contributed to the success of the Bats system, which has been taking equity market share away from the Nasdaq and NYSE since it launched just over a year ago.Getco and Citadel last year signed up as early adopters of the joint venture between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, which aims to form the first centrally cleared foreign exchange marketplace. One Chicago-based fund of hedge funds manager says that as the lines between exchanges, broker-dealers, hedge funds and proprietary trading firms blur, it remains to be seen which firms and business models stand to benefit most. “It is not just a case of who will win, but a question of what constitutes winning,” he says.THE SYSTEM OF PROGRAM TRADINGThe term “program trading” applies to any type of strategy that uses quantitative analysis to identify mispricings of instruments such as stocks, bonds, indices or derivatives. The aim is to profit from exploiting these by trading in a highly automated, systematic fashion.An example is index arbitrage, which involves selling futures on an index while simultaneously buying back a basket of its component stocks when the index is worth more than its constituent parts. The relationship between the value of an index and its constituents is known as the basis and can be positive or negative.Statistical arbitrage involves a “capture” trade designed to take advantage of an unexpected divergence in the relationship between two or more securities that usually hold a steady correlation. Program trading differs from algorithmic trading, which is also widely used by Citadel, DRW and Getco.Algorithmic trading is any highly quantitative, automated method of implementing a trading strategy, be it to add a position on some instrument or merely to hedge individual stock risks in a portfolio.Some algorithms allow traders to buy or sell stock along with the prevailing trend in the market. This is the case with the most widely used form, known as volume-weighted average price, the VWAP. Others offer the ability to mask bids or offers and execute transactions only at pre-defined thresholds."
384;ACN;Accenture Plc;2007-01-08T17:24:52Z;Ignore the sweetener of yet another deal and go organic;;"If the political scientist James Flynn is right, and IQ levels in the developed world are rising by about three points every decade, then this January we should notch up the second of the three points we can expect to gain by 2010. I am sure you are feeling better about yourself already.And to continue with the new year’s optimistic mood, what about the prospects for an even healthier mergers and acquisitions market in 2007, beating last year’s record levels of activity? An article in the latest edition of McKinsey on Finance suggests that dealmakers are indeed getting better at M&A, learning to avoid the pitfall of overpaying, and creating more value for shareholders. This analysis echoes the findings of Scott Moeller at Cass Business School in London, in his research carried out with consultants Towers Perrin. Maybe the “Flynn effect” is making itself felt among the investment banking and corporate executive fraternity.I am still not completely convinced by the claims of a new enlightenment among M&A practitioners – though I am less doubtful than I was when I wrote about the subject in this column last May. And even if global stock markets’ generally vigorous start to the new year can be put down to expectations of a continued M&A boom, that is no reason to believe that all the old problems associated with mega-deals have been solved.Just in time, a new piece of research from Accenture, the consultancy, arrives to remind even the most gung-ho dealmaker that M&A remains complicated, risky and unpredictable. A survey of 154 senior managers in the US revealed that inadequate pre-deal planning was still leading to a familiar catalogue of real-life problems that do not always get discussed at analysts’ briefings or at press conferences called to announce a merger.Value-destroying headaches include: lower synergies than planned; supply chain disruptions that hurt sales; an inventory build-up that increases the cost of goods sold; and a drop in product quality. End of reality check.What all business leaders know, but some choose to forget, is that the most sustainable form of growth is organic – that is to say, it is based on success in the market rather than being bolted on through yet another deal. But organic growth takes longer, involves lots of hard, unglamorous work, and can go unrecognised by stock markets, thus, ironically, leaving a company vulnerable to the very non-organic experience of being taken over. No wonder the quick hit of the deal so often proves an irresistible option.Gurus and consultants sometimes claim that one or two simple developments – it might be radical, disruptive innovation; it might be cultural transformation – are all that stand between the company and more sustainable growth. But this narrow approach is generally no more helpful in establishing lasting growth than simply buying up a smaller competitor might be.So how do you do it? What are the characteristics of those companies that have grown and continue to grow organically? Margaret Exley, chairwoman of consultants Mercer Delta in the UK, offered some suggestions at the end of last year with the firm’s publication of “Designed to Grow”, a study of so-called “growth champions”.Out of a cross-section of 212 companies in the US and Europe, only 23 could claim the title of growth champion. These businesses had all managed consistent year-on-year growth, and most had achieved an increase in revenue, net operating income and share price over a period of five years, at twice the rate of the rest.Mercer Delta found that six practices were common to its 23 star performers. Growth champions were crystal clear about where they would find growth, and they understood how to be profitable in those areas.They were excellent at execution at all levels and worked hard at promoting that excellence. They made effective trade-offs about which opportunities to invest in. They had a strong culture of measurement, used feedback well and focused the business on only a few initiatives.These practices were supported by four “enablers”: growth champions build leaders’ capabilities to grow from within, develop a culture in which people can adapt to change, maintain fewer levels of management to allow decisions to be made faster, and hold formal, cross-functional or regional forums to lead innovation.That all sounds splendid. But what does the reality look like? Ms Exley has been struck by the way in which growth champions keep things simple.In her report she offers Brett White, chief executive of US property company CB Richard Ellis, as a star witness: “We don’t spend weeks in seclusion working on strategic plans because the business changes faster than we plan,” Mr White is quoted as saying. “We are very empirical. We’ve cut out the nonsense and focused on what makes money.”Ms Exley also points to Philippe Varin, chief executive of steelmaker Corus, who has led the company out of near-bankruptcy in 2002 to where it is today, the target of an ongoing £5bn bidding war.“He simply asked the firm very directly what businesses it should really be in,” she says. “And he has killed off a lot of them. It has been a very tough but effective approach.” Another exemplary simplifier is Procter and Gamble, which also kills off brands year after year.Long-term success stories are built on clear and decisive management action. The artificial sweetener of another deal is all very well if you want to make your next quarterly presentation more palatable. But for wholesome, tastier and longer lasting results, it is time to go organic."
385;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
386;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Retail revolution: are you being e-served?;;"At Apple Computer’s flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, the post-Christmas retail rush was in full swing last Wednesday.Customers were lining up outside the glass cube entrance to file down the stairs into one of the hottest stores in the city. At the long “Genius Bar” that runs down one side of the store, 21 employees were providing customers with the technical advice that has set Apple’s retail concept apart from the competition.But on this particular day, 21 geniuses were still not enough. A customer clutching his computer who tried to register for a face-to-face advice session was told he’d have to wait three hours and walked away.The afternoon melée, at a retailer known for its “high touch” customer service, was an extreme illustration of one of the central challenges that extends beyond retail to customer service in general. How do you have enough experts available to serve customers, but not so many that their wages bankrupt operations?“Retailers are always trying to find a way to use fewer people to service and touch more customers,” says Jeff Smith, head of global retail practice at Accenture, the consultancy group.In 2007, a handful of leading retailers will try a new technological approach to the issue. If a sales representative is not available, shoppers will be offered a screen-based alternative – not just a static web page but a live video link from the store to an expert sales agent located either in another store or, more likely, in a call centre.“We think the potential is enormous, certainly in retail formats,” says Chris Sang, chief executive of ClairVista, one of two small US companies that have developed “remote support” systems. “There’s really a total consensus among all the retailers we speak to that this is a good solution.”Experticity, ClairVista’s Seattle-based competitor, already has its system being tested by a leading US office supply retailer and a European mobile phone network operator. Further deployments of LiveSupport are expected during the first quarter of 2007.ClairVista says its own Live Expert screens will be in use by a national consumer electronics retailer at the same time. Neither company would give details of customers because of confidentiality agreements.D.L. Baron, the founder and chief executive of Experticity, first had the idea of using the internet to provide live customer assistance in 2000 when he was standing in an airport queue.“I showed up at the airport and there were all those counters and only two agents working, and the whole idea of distributive labour force came to me,” he says. He realised that the airline probably had other service staff elsewhere in its network who could be linked to kiosks at the airport.Both systems involve more than just a video link. The screens can show content such as demonstration videos and product information. The latest version of LiveSupport lets customers access the system from home computers or mobile phones.ClairVista launched Live Expert in November 2005. The system uses large screens for a stronger impact, on the basis that this is where the battle to win over both customers and retailers will largely be fought.Both companies agree that the remote systems are particularly suited to the needs of “commodity” retailers, which are now trying to sell more sophisticated and expensive products and services that need to be explained to customers. Best Buy and Circuit City, for instance, have both followed Apple’s lead in creating teams of experts to provide a higher level of customer service.Remote support systems could make it easier for mass retailers such as Wal-Mart or Target to follow. As they try to sell higher-end electronics and add-ons, including customer warranty plans, such companies will also want to control staffing costs.As Mr Sang is aware, the aisles of US retailers are littered with aspiring technological solutions. ClairVista launched a line of DVD-dispensing kiosks at outlets including McDonald’s restaurants. “The challenge is getting something implemented,” he says.“This takes a strategic point of view. It’s not something that you stick in a corner and see how it works. And if you just take $7-per-hour inventory clerks and put them in front of the camera and call them an expert, then it is not going to work.”Mr Smith says most retailers are wary of “functional change”, preferring instead to look for “a point solution to a point problem that incrementally improves their operations”.That covers recent technological innovations, from self-service supermarket check-outs to bar-code readers that provide a commentary on a particular bottle of wine or a pharmacy kiosk that will check a customer’s identity and dispense repeat prescriptions.Remote support could provide that “point solution” if it increases sales. Experticity claims that, in pilot tests, it increased the overall value of a sale in more than 70 per cent of cases.But Mr Smith argues that systems such as remote support could be a chance for retailers to take a new look at the kind of expertise they are providing. It could be an opportunity “to create people who are more the agent of the customer than they are experts or stockers or cashiers”.Beyond retail, both Expert­icity and ClairVista see plenty of scope for using remote support systems to augment customer service - whether that is by linking doctors to new walk-in health clinics or checking in hotel guests.Mr Baron says Experticity was recently approached by a high-end fashion retailer that was interested in using the system to offer style advice.But surely customers always prefer to deal with a real person face-to-face? Not necessarily, says Mr Baron, though it is a key question for retailers.“We encountered doubt and scepticism,” he says. “Then we found out that
not only would customers engage with a screen, but they were delighted.“Putting enough knowledgeable people on the floor is really tough. So the person on the screen has access to a lot more de facto information. And the person on the screen, for some customers, is also a lot less threatening. They’re not going to follow you round the store trying to make a sale.”"

He upgraded his recommendation from “hold to “buy” and raised his price target from €32 to €35.Goldman Sachs welcomed the acquisition as strategically sensible, saying it boosted Publicis’ exposure to interactive advertising. However, it also flagged the risks associated with Digitas’ portfolio as two clients, Amex and GM, accounted for 48 per cent of revenues in 2005.Richemont rose 3 per cent to a record SFr71.35 on hopes that the Swiss luxury goods group will benefit from Christmas spending on expensive watches. Richemeont owns the Cartier watch brand and the value of Swiss watch exports reached a record SFr1.52bn in November, up 13 per cent year-on-year, with premium brands leading the way. Swatch Group, which owns the Omega and Rado luxury brands, rose 0.8 per cent to SFr54.00.Fresh takeover speculation pushed Suez up 2.1 per cent to €38.57 but more uncertainty also surrounded the French utility company’s proposed €80bn merger with Gaz de France, 1.6 per cent higher at €34.23.Francois Pinault, the French billionaire is rumoured to be considering an offer for Suez and could sell its energy asets to Gaz de France.Brokers said the proposed merger between Suez and Gaz de France looked increasingly uncertain after La Tribune carried reports that the shareholders meeting required to approve the deal was unlikely to take place before July 1.This delay would prevent the French government from making the merger irreversible before the presidential election in May and a new government would likely block the deal.Meanwhile, Suez tried to underline its ambitions to be a major player in the French energy market after its Belgian subsidiary, Electrabel, raised its stake in France’s Societe Hydro-Electrique du Midi (SHEM) from 40 per cent to 99.6 per cent for €504.5m.EADS, the embattled aerospace company, gained 2.2 per cent to €25.79 as more orders started to roll back in for the delayed Airbus A380 superjumbo after the Australian carrier Qantas ordered an additional eight aircraft, taking its total order to twenty.Strong first-quarter results for Accenture, the management consulting and technology services company, provided a boost for Cap Gemini, Europe’s largest IT consultancy, up 2.3 per cent to €46.90.Accenture highlighted its improved pricing power and Patrick Standaert of Bear Stearns said Cap Gemini was the most obvious beneficiary given its exposure to the hot US IT services market and larger consulting business. Bear Stearns reiterated its “outperform” recommendation and €55 price target ahead of Cap Gemini’s results on February 15.Credit Suisse firmed 0.4 per cent to SFr83.90 on news of an agreement to buy a majority interest in Hedging-Griffo, the Brazilian asset management and private banking company, for SFr358m in cash. The acquisition will only have a tiny impact on Credit Suisse’s bottom line.Dresdner Kleinwort said the price was a fair balance between potential growth and risk as it was questionable if the Brazilian margins were sustainable since they were running at twice the level of the Credit Suisse flagship wealth management division.Swisscom, up 1.4 per cent to SFr465.00, still has up to SFr6bn for acquisitions after buying back a 25 per cent stake in its mobile phone unit from Vodafone Group for SFr4.25bn, according to its chief executive.Deutsche reiterated a “buy” recommendation on Total of France, 0.2 per cent lower at €54.50. Analyst Lucas Hermann said the European oils sector was now trading at a record low of 9.3 x 2007 earnings and European producers should manage 5 per cent volume growth next year.MAN added 0.4 per cent at €69.37 after the German truckmaker’s chief executive expressed confidence that the €10.3bn bid for Swedish rival Scania would succeed after EU approval was granted.
388;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-11-18T00:20:45Z;Clues to ‘classic Murdoch manoeuvre’;;"James Murdoch has either pulled off a strategic coup worthy of his father, Rupert, or he has laid his company open to a vicious battle with rivals, regulators and shareholders with potentially dangerous consequences.British Sky Broadcasting’s sudden swoop on ITV left many executives in the industry gasping with shock, admiration or confusion.But it also set rivals running to their lawyers, and threatening a fierce fight.There was more consensus about BSkyB’s motives.“My first instinct is that it’s a spoiler,” says Theresa Wise, media partner with Accenture.BSkyB struck eight days after NTL, its largest pay-television rival, made a £5bn-plus bid approach to ITV, a deal that – while fraught with complications – would have united his two biggest rivals and given them a distinctive line-up of media outlets and programming content.At the same time RTL, Europe’s largest broadcaster, was finalising plans for a private equity-backed bid of its own.BSkyB’s 17.9 per cent stake in ITV, which it may take up to the 19.9 per cent maximum it is allowed by the 2003 Communications Act, is large enough to block either deal. “This is a classic Murdoch manoeuvre,” says Mathew Horsman, managing director of Mediatique, a consultancy. “It might be expensive but it does bring Sky to the table in the evolving ITV situation and pre-empts NTL’s efforts to do a transforming deal.”Several analysts drew parallels with Rupert Murdoch’s recent decision to purchase 7.5 per cent of John Fairfax, a close rival to News Corporation, BSkyB’s largest shareholder, in the Australian media industry. The stake will effectively make News Corp a kingmaker in the long-awaited shake-up of the Australian media sector.James Murdoch’s own explanation was that the stake is a long-term financial investment, which “reflects our belief ITV’s decline has been overstated”.Ms Wise agrees that, given the market’s pessimism about ITV and the possibility that regulators might loosen regulatory restraints on its advertising revenues, “it doesn’t get better than this in terms of buying ITV”.Several analysts questioned whether BSkyB would hold the investment for long, however, saying it could instead be a way to get 100 per cent control of another broadcaster, Five.The channel is owned by RTL but would have to be sold should RTL succeed in buying ITV.“What Sky could do is to prevent NTL from buying ITV and let RTL buy the company,” says Guy Di Piazza, media specialist at Ernst & Young. “Then it could swap its stake for Channel Five.”NTL’s US-listed shares rose 5 per cent on the news, reversing recent losses, as shareholders gambled that a deal that would double NTL’s debts was less likely.People close to both NTL and RTL made clear, however, that they believed their deals were far from dead.On Wednesday, at the sun-drenched Hotel Arts in Barcelona, James Murdoch told investors at a Morgan Stanley conference that he did not see NTL’s approach to ITV as much of an issue.If that were the case, one analyst asked yesterday, “was this really necessary?”Jeremy Darroch, BSkyB’s chief financial officer, says yesterday’s move will cost the company no more
than £10m in financing charges this financial year and £13m the next, while leaving it well within its covenants.Investors had thought the cash was reserved for BSkyB’s roll-out of broadband services, however, and may want a fuller explanation of its decision to park it in a minority investment in a company dependent on the advertising cycle.James Murdoch has several battles to win yet but if he does take after his father, he will enjoy the fight.Additional reporting by Aline van Duyn in New York"
389;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-10-18T20:25:17Z;Banks begin to dip into ‘dark pools’;;Morgan Stanley is joining the growing list of banks that are challenging stock exchanges by forming “dark liquidity pools”, internal trading platforms that anonymously match buy and sell orders.The dark pools, also known as dark books or internal crossing networks, pose a potential competitive threat to exchanges, by internally matching orders without publishing quotes – a service that is particularly popular with traders using computer-executed strategies.Morgan Stanley’s new platform – called MS Pool – is the bank’s first branded offering in this area, although it was one of the first entrants to the dark pool market in the late 1990s. It joins about a dozen such entities, each with a slightly different approach. Others include Goldman Sachs’s Sigma X, Credit Suisse’s CrossFinder and UBS’s Price Improvement Network.Bill Neuberger, head of electronic trading at Morgan Stanley, said, “Orders coming into the system will have the ability to interact with Morgan Stanley order flow before being routed externally to the exchanges.”The creation of dark pools represents the latest challenge to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq as the two largest US equities exchanges seek to expand internationally – the NYSE through a planned merger with pan-European exchange Euronext and the Nasdaq through its stake building in the London Stock Exchange.“This is a threat to the exchange as the traditional hub of liquidity,” said Bill Cline, head of the capital markets practice at consultant Accenture. “These dark pools are an alternative mechanism to the traditional exchange, absent many of the fees and costs of an exchange.”Mr Cline said: “The popularity of dark pools is a shot across the bows of the NYSE Group and Nasdaq duopoly, especially if fees increase.”Catherine Kinney, NYSE president, told a recent Securities Industry Association conference that these systems were impairing price discovery. She said every share crossed “in the dark” was a share that did not assist the market in determining an accurate price.The NYSE and Nasdaq might be hoping that regulators help them fend off these systems. Under Regulation National Market System, controversial proposals that attempt to level the playing field, any trading venue that accumulates more than 5 per cent of US equity volume must provide open quotes to the broad market.

Today, they need soft skills and a way with words.Ken Harris, CIO of Shaklee, a Californian company producing natural nutrition, skincare and vitamin products with a turnover of $500m, has worked for Gap, Nike and PepsiCo.He has recently implemented customer relationship management (CRM) software from RightNow technologies at Shaklee. RightNow is one of a growing number of suppliers that allows users to operate software as a dial-up service, subscribing to the system by usage and leaving the actual running and operation to the original vendor.“My role has morphed into that of a communicator over the past 25 years, ” says Mr Harris. “When we decided to use the RightNow software, we got the senior business people together and said to them ‘Here is a tool and anyone can use it’. The whole discussion that followed was about our business and where it is going.”Mr Harris notes that an effective CIO communicates with multiple constituencies, including his suppliers.He talks of “vendor management”, the art of keeping a dialogue with different vendors open, as a skill he has acquired. “And you have to be able to let people see that a new idea will make their life easier, so your job involves more and more internal salesmanship.”Nigel Underwood was CIO at logistics group Excel, and now holds the same job at DHL Logistics. Managing IT after an acquisition is about making staff realise integration is about people and their expectations, he says.His first concern was that IT staff should feel part of a structure instead of thinking that their world had been taken over and they had lost control.“You start with the internal audience, you open lines of communication for feedback. It is not just about soft communication skills, but about how you plan ahead and manage the deployment of those skills.”Mr Underwood, a mathematics graduate, summarises his work as “99 per cent ‘I for Information’ and only 1 per cent ‘T for technology’. I try not to talk in acronyms, and I remember that communication is a two-way process. My role is to educate and coach.”He uses his membership of The Infrastructure Forum (TIF), a professional body for European IT directors, to compare notes with contemporaries.“We have learned to position ourselves so we get an insight into the whole business remit.”Organisations like this can help top up skills developed via media training aimed at teaching the CIO to explain his work to readers of non-technical publications.But the divide between the CIO and his fellow board members still exists, according to business adviser, Accenture.California-based Accenture partner Gary Curtis works with clients evaluating the IT implications of mergers. He says formal training can make a big difference to the way the CIO is perceived by his colleagues and a broader audience.“Look at the kind of coaching a chief executive gets. There is a lot of ongoing public relations training. But it is still rare to see that at the CIO level.”Recruiting CIOs with a background in anything other than technology and a track record in clear communication is one option.However, given the scarcity of such individuals, Mr Curtis suggests being realistic: “They may learn about communications along the way, but if not, they should be trying to go out and acquire world-class business communications skills.”He concedes that only a very small proportion of CIOs fit this bill, but at least they constitute “a growing faction”.If nothing else, as the role of IT shifts within companies, the CIO needs to be a good communicatior, if only to explain why this job still matters so much.

Over the next five years, Big Blue plans to spend $100m on making its mainframes easier to program and manage via a modern user interface and new tools that allow novices to program mainframes.Ease of use has never been a strong point of mainframes and the number of IT professionals skilled in traditional mainframe software is declining fast.Open source intelligenceJasperSoft, an up-and-coming vendor of open-source business intelligence software, has developed Jasper4Salesforce, a version of its software for Salesforce.com’s popular on-demand customer relationship management software.Businesses can create and access reports directly inside of Salesforce applications, instead of having to buy a stand-alone BI solution or process the data through a spreadsheet. Pricing starts at $20 a month for each user.Open source contentAnother open-source vendor, Alfresco, has unveiled a “preview release” of its enterprise content management system. Just like its proprietary counterparts, the Alfresco software offers high-end features such as collaborative document, records and image management, and web content management. Alfresco was founded by execs from Documentum, the one-time leader of the ECM industry, which was acquired by EMC, the storage giant.SOA middlewareBEA Systems has made a flurry of announcements designed to transform its existing middleware products for the brave new world of service-oriented architectures. Its new SOA 360° platform spans BEA’s exisiting Tuxedo, WebLogic and AquaLogic products and is based on a micro-Services Architecture, that BEA is “previewing”.Web-based deliveryAccenture has won a $199m contract from Calpers, California’s state pension fund, to redesign its IT systems using a service-oriented architecture.By moving to web-based delivery, Calpers hopes to streamline administrative processes and improve access to its data. Accenture plans to invest heavily over three years in developing its SOA skills and says this contract provides a big vote of confidence for SOA.Hosted PBXOracle has announced Virtual PBX, a carrier-grade software platform that telecoms operators can use to offer hosted PBX services. Oracle is not traditionally associated with telecoms software, but the worlds of IT and telecoms are converging thanks to open standards such as J2EE, SOA and web technologies.Paperless offices?Version One, whose document managing and imaging products help create paperless offices, has promised to plant a tree on behalf of every new customer. The Cheshire-based company expects this to make it “carbon neutral” within a year. Version One e-mailed me a certificate, saying it had planted a tree to make my journey to the launch party of its green initiative carbon neutral. I’ve printed it out and pinned it up. Though on second thoughts, perhaps that wasn’t quite what the paper-free champions had in mind...
392;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-10-12T06:44:15Z;Multinationals cut down on outsourcing;;The wave of outsourcing that has engulfed the global economy over the past few years is showing signs of abating as multinational companies opt for shorter and smaller deals, according to a study to be published on Thursday.The outsourcing industry has just experienced its worst quarter in four years and is unlikely to match the $81.9bn in contracts won in 2005 by the end of this year, data from the consulting firm Technology Partners International shows.A slowdown in 2006 would mark the second consecutive yearly fall in the volume of outsourcing contracts since their $84.7bn peak reached in 2004.The results suggest that, following the drive to curb costs and streamline operations by contracting out non-core functions, multinationals might be running out of major operations to outsource.Although companies appear to be buying a wider range of services from a larger number of providers, their preference for shorter deals is heightening competition among outsourcing groups. The average contract length is down to four years from about 10 years in the recent past.“In some sectors, especially information technology, companies perceive that there has been a commoditisation of services, leading them to opt for shorter-term contracts of lower overall value,” said Peter Allen, a partner at TPI. “We just don’t see enough big deals in the pipeline to cause us to believe the levels of last year will be reached”.The trend is likely to raise concerns in countries such as India and China and among groups such as IBM, Accenture and Electronic Data Systems, which have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the outsourcing trend.A slowdown in the transfer of jobs and business units to developing countries and outside providers could quell anti-globalisation and protectionist urges in the US and Europe.According to TPI, which tracks worldwide deals worth more than $50m, outsourcing contracts signed between July and September totalled $13.4bn, a fall of more than 20 per cent on both the previous quarter and the same period last year. The weakness of the past three months has left the total for the year at $55.3bn, more than $26bn below the figure for the whole of 2005.However, the total number of contracts awarded so far this year has risen slightly over the same period a year ago, a sign that companies are still willing to outsource services but for shorter periods of time.
393;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-10-11T19:06:47Z;Infosys Technologies;;India’s software outsourcing sector defies gravity. Infosys Technologies, the number two technology exporter, opened the interim reporting season with a robust 43 per cent jump in net income to $373m.By using low-cost workers – industry wages in India are about one-sixth of those in the US – to carry out top-dollar projects around the globe, Infosys and its peers are winning ever more contracts. Infosys’ revenues rose 40 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the interim and it now boasts a brace of $100m contracts. Operating margins, at 27 per cent for the half year, nudged up a percentage point in the second quarter alone.Top-line growth shows no signs of abating. Indeed, the addition of a slew of clients in the second quarter prompted Infosys to increase its full-year forecasts. The Bangalore-based company is also trying to diversify its client base. It is dependent on banking and financial services, which account for almost one third of revenues, reflecting the industry trend for outsourcing back-office and other activities to India. About two thirds of revenues are generated by the US.The big tripwire is escalating costs. Second-quarter operating margins were flattered by rupee depreciation and the move to take visa costs upfront in the first quarter. Salaries continue to escalate as competitors – such as International Business Machines and Accenture of the US – start expanding on Infosys’ home turf. Entry-level wages will rise 17 per cent at Infosys next year as it fights for staff. Even then, finding enough sufficiently skilled staff locally is a headache – hence Infosys’ recruitment drive in the US and Europe. Retaining staff is also getting trickier. Attrition rates are running at 13 per cent, three percentage points higher than the previous year.Infosys runs a smart operation but galloping growth can bring with it fresh challenges.

395;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-09-29T15:54:37Z;At last, an NHS good news story;;Information technology in the NHS is rightly getting a bad press at the moment. The NHS National Programme for IT, being delivered by NHS Connecting for Health, is a disaster. The project, which will bring new computer systems into the NHS, connect GPs in England to hospitals and give patients access to their personal health information, is running at double its estimated start-up cost of £6.2bn. The most successful contractor, Accenture, this week announced it is pulling out of its contract by way of an exit deal with the NHS.But here’s a good news IT story – a web service called Renal Patient View, designed for patients who are attending renal clinics or are on renal dialysis in the UK. The service has recently been rolled out to 22 renal units. The number of patients using it – 2,000 and rising – may be small but it works.Enrolled patients can access, from any internet connection, all their blood results and clinical letters. They opt in, rather than opt out as on the forthcoming Connecting For Health scheme. Additionall y, the information is for use only by patients and relevant clinicians, whereas Connecting For Health intends to make most confidential information available to all NHS staff, which for me denigrates the meaning of confidential health records.As far as I can see, the renal system is unique. It cost less than £100,000 to set up, which in the grand scheme of things is peanuts. There is no central funding on offer but the project does not wish to depend on either commercial or external support anyway. It estimates that it will cost, for 2007, £1 per eligible patient. You can get a free demonstration at www.renalpatient view.orgWhat this shows is that if we have to spend billions upgrading a computer system, it would certainly be useful if patients could view notes on it in a sensible and coherent way.It has been quite a while since doctors stopped writing medical notes safe in the knowledge that patients would never read them. The expectation now is that these can be read by patients, though the speed at which the notes are created and the abbreviations used to do this do not exactly make them user-friendly. (For example, non-cardiac CP, 20+ cigs daily, C2H5OH XS, BP 150/90 is shorthand for someone who smokes and drinks to excess and has high blood pressure and chest pain that doesn’t sound like it originates from the heart.)Add to this the fact that, currently, if I want three different types of blood test results and an X-ray report, I must make four phone calls to four separate departments if the paper copies have yet to arrive. Dealing with this is part of the admittedly tall order that NHS Connecting For Health is supposed to deliver.The remarkable thing about Renal Patient View is that no one from the government or the Department of Health asked for this system. It was developed because doctors and patients thought it would be useful, and then a lot of people put in a lot of effort to get it running.Professor Neil Turner and Dr Keith Simpson, who are on the steering group for Renal Patient View, are modest about its achievements. “We’d been involved in renal IT for years but from a patient point of view, few things had changed,” says Turner.The idea was to make the information available for patients in a useful format and also provide additional value to renal units – “for example, clinicians being able to look at patient results from any computer terminal”, Turner says.Renal medicine often hinges more than many other kinds on test results, making it ideal for this kind of data-sharing. Feedback from patients has been very positive.One patient says: “It is one of the best innovations I have encountered in the NHS in my 50 years’ involvement.”nitial concerns that it may generate more work for staff have yet to be borne out. There have been instances when patients have been faster to spot abnormalities in blood results than the doctors. These patients have contacted the hospital team directly, saving everyone time and effort. Patients feel they know more about what is happening to them. Links to information sheets enable them to understand unfamiliar terms or tests. There are also contact details for doctors and nurses in case of problems.The low cost of the project prompts the question: is it running on goodwill, which can’t necessarily be duplicated or developed elsewhere? Simpson says not. “It’s not run as a charity – it runs lean but not purely on goodwill. There is lots of co-operation and huge amounts of enthusiasm from not just patients but renal units and data managers who have made it work.”The next step is to make sure that the remaining renal units that want to join up do so.Not just good news then but a reminder to those seeking to privatise and “modernise” the health service. The most effective and cost-efficient resources might actually be inside the NHS, the people who work in it and the patients who contribute time and effort to making it better.Margaret McCartney is a GP in Glasgowmargaret.mccartney@ft.comMore columns from Margaret McCartney
396;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-09-28T12:37:29Z;BHS fails M&S test;;Pre-tax profits at Sir Philip Green’s BHS stores plunged 60 per cent last year. Things have picked up since the year end on April 1 but it looks like Philip’s attempt to tackle M&S head on, which he announced when he lost the battle for control of M&S, has failed. Philip will no doubt have plenty to say on this when our reporters talk to him later (he usually does). In the meantime, he has said: “The results for the last financial year are obviously disappointing. I stated at the end of last year that profits would be down significantly due to internal ranging mistakes, particularly in womenswear. This has resulted in significant increases in markdown and therefore margin erosion.” Perhaps BHS could use a little help from the Fashion Retail Academy that Philip helped set up. It promises to teach “all of the practical and vocational skills needed for the challenging and fast paced world of fashion retail”.BHS’s figures are not the only bad news from the high street. HMV said like-for-like sales fell 3.7 per cent in the twelve weeks to September 23 and margins fell too. Trading at Waterstone’s seems to have been particularly disappointing. HMV’s shares (down 40 per cent from the highs of early 2005) are up a touch this morning.Royal & Sun Alliance is at last ridding itself of its troubled US business by selling it to the unit’s management. It will have to absorb a £443m loss in the process, including the injection of £158m of capital. But – having amassed $2.7bn of underwriting losses over the last 10 years, never once made an underwriting profit in that time and had a rights issue to help fund the business three years ago – RSA looks well shot of this business. If the management team, all run-off specialists, can scratch some value out of this business over the next four years, RSA will get £158m back. The key point, though, is that the US business has been holding back RSA’s stock for years. Today, the shares are up 3 per cent, possibly reflecting the fact that RSA has effectively lost the poison pill that prevented people bidding for it.Isoft says it will remain involved with the NHS IT contract despite Accenture pulling out, as we reported this morning. It also says any potential litigation with Accenture over the contract had been annulled. Its shares are up 17 per cent as a result.Peter Dicks, former chairman of Sportingbet, is due back in court in New York today to see if he will be extradited to Louisiana. We will have a reporter there.We also have a strong trading statement from the London Stock Exchange, saying business was good over the summer, and an update from Icap which has left some fearful about its growth prospects. No more details yet on the merger talks the two held this summer.

397;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Accenture quits £2bn NHS contracts;;Accenture, the US consultancy, has pulled out of a major upgrade of computer systems for the National Health Service, walking away from contracts worth more than £2bn, iSoft, the UK healthcare software company said on Thursday.Isoft, which had been working with Accenture, said the US group’s work would be transferred to an alliance led by Computer Sciences Corporation, the US-listed supplier to the north-west and West Midlands, in which iSoft is a member.Accenture’s move will be seen as a further blow to the already-troubled £12.4bn NHS programme, the world’s biggest civilian IT project, key parts of which are running two years late.The government, however, will be able to claim its decision to have competing companies install the system in different parts of the country will still allow the programme to move ahead.Accenture won two of the five big contracts, worth about £1bn each over 10 years, to supply electronic patient records and a range of other applications to hospitals, family doctors and community services in the whole of the east and north-east.Under its contract, Accenture is understood to be liable for big penalty payments for failure to deliver. But it is also due some payment for work completed. Negotiations took place on Wednesday on a settlement package that could see Accenture receive a net payment from the NHS approaching £100m.Given the expenditure the company has incurred though, its overall losses are expected to be at least $450m (£238m). The US-listed company is due to announce its full-year results in New York on Thursday and it is possible that failure to come to an agreement with the NHS could result in costly litigation – something that one person close to the negotiations said on Wednesday night was “in no-one’s interest”.The deal makes the NHS heavily reliant on CSC which will hold 60 per cent of the nearly £5bn local supplier contracts. Those in turn are underpinned by the financially troubled iSoft which has been writing the software for the patient record systems for Accenture and CSC.As a result, the programme is expected to advertise for another local service provider to be on stand-by to take over up to half of the work that falls to CSC’s shoulders should the company struggle to cope. BT has already expressed an interest in taking on any NHS work available.Accenture’s move will strengthen demands from opposition MPs and others for a review of the NHS programme – demands ministers look set to continue to resist.The company declined to comment on Wednesday night.

399;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-09-22T12:41:53Z;Corporate name changes;;Name changes can work, as Saloth Sar, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu and Robert LeRoy Parker discovered. For corporations, rebranding usually invites ridicule. The decision on Friday by the UK’s MFI to sell its retail DIY unit and rename the residual joinery business is a case in point. “Galiform” ticks all the right boxes: a first letter near the beginning of the alphabet, easy pronunciation, a hint of dynamic activity, and, critically, meaninglessness.At least Galiform has a decent excuse. Newly independent businesses need names. Occasionally their baptisms actually succeed. The City mocked BT Mobile’s transformation into mmO2 until it became a highly successful brand. Lucky timing meant that Accenture escaped the fall out that might otherwise have hit the former consulting arm of disgraced accounting giant Arthur Andersen.Other companies change names to muffle history. Keen to appear global, EDF, BP, and BAE Systems now avoid spelling out names which spell out their nationality. The uninitiated would never guess that Altria mainly sells Philip Morris cigarettes. Only a lone few corporations haul around their historical baggage proudly. The colonial-era operator of the world’s busiest canal still calls itself Suez. Aeroflot provided the spectacle of a company being floated with a Soviet hammer and sickle in its logo.Deals are the main explanation of name changes. The diplomatic alternative can get cumbersome, as Schoder Salomon Smith Barney and Vodafone Airtouch Mannesmann discovered. Still, mergers have supplied a spate of bland, classical or latinate names such as Verizon, Eon, Aviva, Corus, Diageo and Fortis. At least they have not sunk to the level of Dixons, an unglamorous UK electrical goods retailer, mysteriously renamed DSG International. That rechristening is something that even Pol Pot, Mother Teresa and Butch Cassidy would find hard to understand.
400;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-09-11T17:33:30Z;FTI pays $260m for Financial Dynamics;;Financial Dynamics, one of the top financial public relations companies, is being bought for an initial $260m in cash and shares by FTI Consulting, a US consulting and investigations company.The deal represents the highest price ever paid for a financial public relations company, underlining the increasing value that corporate clients place on issues such as reputation management.It is also the first time a financial PR firm has been acquired by a consulting company, rather than a media or marketing group.Charles Watson, chief executive of FD in London, said financial PR had much more in common with consulting than with agency businesses and predicted there could be “other similar transactions to come”.Brunswick, FD’s biggest rival in London, is known to have had talks in the past with Accenture, when it was still Andersen Consulting.For FTI, the purchase dramatically expands its presence outside the US, where it is a leading restructuring and litigation adviser.Jack Dunn, FTI’s chief executive, said FD had “trusted adviser relationships with businesses and government in important financial centres around the world” that would offer “tremendous cross-selling and collaboration opportunities”.The deal represents a big return for FD’s management and Advent International, a private equity firm that bought the company three years ago from Cordiant Communications for £26m (or $43.3m at the time of the deal), including debt.Some 160 FD executives will get cash and restricted FTI stock worth £62.7m for their 57 per cent of the equity while Advent will get £47m in cash in return for its investment of £8m. The management could earn up to a further $80m depending on performance over the next five years.The sale to FTI is the third time FD management has bought and sold the business since 1998.FTI intends to operate FD as a separate business run by the existing management team under Charles Watson and Declan Kelly, its chief executive in the US.FD, which has 450 staff, is forecast to make about $34m before tax in 2006 and Mr Dunn said he expected it to continue to show organic growth rates of 20 per cent to 30 per cent.Deutsche Bank advised FTI, which will fund the deal through the issue of $215m on senior unsecured notes.Robert W. Baird advised FD.
401;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Isoft receives bid approaches;;Isoft, the beleaguered software supplier to the £6.2bn ($11.7bn) National Health Service IT project in the UK, has received several informal approaches from both private equity firms and trade rivals looking to buy all or part of its business.Meanwhile, Accenture, the consultancy that has taken a $450m charge for losses on the same project, is looking to renegotiate its contract with the government and potentially withdraw from at least part of the project.The developments add to the sense of turmoil surrounding the scheme known as Connecting for Health, the world’s largest civilian IT project, which is running about two years behind schedule.Isoft on Friday published its results for the 12 months to the end of April only hours before its shares were due to be suspended because of a failure to report the figures. It reported a loss before tax of £343.8m.The company also announced that it had secured financing for the next 15 months, buying the company breathing space as it attempts to secure new revenue streams and cut costs before a possible rights issue or sale.Isoft on Friday revealed a new arrangement with Computer Sciences Corporation which, like Accenture, is a lead contractor on the NHS project that subcontracts software provision to Isoft.There was, however, no news of any renegotiated deal with Accenture, where relations are understood to be far worse — each side blaming the other for delays to implementation of the project. Shares in Isoft rose 32 per cent to close at 56p yesterday.Accenture, CSC, Isoft and Connecting for Health all declined to comment.
402;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-08-21T17:50:06Z;Another step on the path to IT’s top 10;;Almost a year ago LogicaCMG was approaching another big acquisition with some trepidation.That summer had seen a wave of protectionist rhetoric from French politicians worried that Pepsi was going to launch a bid for Danone, the flagship food group – not the ideal climate for Logica to go after Unilog, one of France’s leading technology companies.In the event, the fears of Martin Read and his team were unfounded. The logic of consolidation in the IT services sector was such that his €931m ($1.2bn) bid for Unilog was accepted by the target’s management and met with no stirrings of “economic patriotism” from the country’s government or media.The logic continues today. Multinational companies are keen to have fewer IT suppliers and want those that remain to be able to serve them cheaply and globally. Established western IT providers such as IBM, Accenture and Logica are also having to cope with the rise of low-cost Indian rivals.Wanting to play a key role in the consolidation, Logica has set a long-term target to become a top-10 IT services company. Monday’s announced acquisition consolidates it as Europe’s second-largest company in the sector by market value after CapGemini of France.Investors have not always supported the acquisition policy with unfettered enthusiasm. The company’s shares are below the level they were trading at this time last year and, although prone to intra-day volatility, they have remained stagnant over the past few years, underperforming CapGemini and Atos Origin, the other large European competitors.Mr Read was phlegmatic on Monday in the face of a 7.5 per cent fall in Logica’s share price. “It was inevitable with a deal like this that you would get a lot of hedge fund activity,” he said. He pointed out that the shares had fallen on news of the Unilog deal before recovering as integration proceeded.The more sceptical shareholders will now hope that the boundaries of the empire stay fixed for some time. “Investors tend not to forgive companies that overpay,” said Hans Slob, an analyst at Rabo Securities.But Mr Read is unflinching in his determination to enter the global top 10 of IT services companies, dominated by US heavyweights such as IBM. “We’ve been on a journey,” he said. “When I started with Logica 13 years ago there were 3,000 people. This will take it to 40,000.”The company’s issues are not all related to scale. In Germany, Logica has only recently started to turn a profit, helped by the integration of Unilog’s profitable business in the country. There is no obvious quick-fix takeover target that would speed up an improvement.Apart from high-end IT services in areas such as electricity trading and anti-money laundering for central banks, Logica also has a wireless division serving mobile phone operators, which many analysts fear does not make a good fit with the rest of the company and does not generate sufficient profits. Mr Read, though, is in no rush to sell.Mr Read sees the threat to Logica and the wider industry coming from India, where companies such as Tata Consulting and Infosys are already larger than their Anglo-Dutch rival.“It’s particularly refreshing to see a company like Logica expand beyond our shores,” said one person close to the deal yesterday. Observers are divided on whether this patriotic view makes sound business sense.
403;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-07-21T15:39:57Z;Quality ready meals hit the spot;;Gordon Ramsey, Michael Caine, Terence Conran – the British food industry has provided entrepreneurial opportunities for former sportsmen and celebrities.Charlie Bigham has shown that former management consultants can also make great gastronomes.Until 1996 Mr Bigham had been advising others on their business strategies, first at Andersen Consulting and then for a smaller consultancy called ABL. Then he set up Bigham’s with a mission to transform the ready meal market by producing quick and easy dishes made entirely from fresh ingredients.“I wanted to set up and run my own business,” recalls the 39-year-old, whose company, which has been profitable for eight of its 10-year history, increased its turnover by about 30 per cent last year to £12m.Mr Bigham’s eureka moment came while eating a roadside meal on the border of Iran and Pakistan during a career break, driving to India with his girlfriend.“There was a kind of realisation that quick food doesn’t have to be horrible microwaved or frozen food. It isn’t in most places in the world. They just take some ingredients and toss them in a pan.”Coming from outside the food industry was an advantage, according to Mr Bigham, who as a consultant often found himself eating ready made meals after a long working day.“You approach it as a customer. People in the industry said, ‘You cannot possibly use fresh herbs. They are too expensive.’ Or, ‘You cannot possibly charge that price.’ I said I would like to eat fresh herbs and would be prepared to pay a bit more if it was all quality.”Mr Bigham, who made his first meal in the kitchen of his Notting Hill home, initially sold his dinners to independent food shops, expanding into the food halls at Harvey Nichols, Selfridges and Harrods as well as Booths, the upmarket grocery shop chain in the north of England. His big break came when Waitrose agreed to put Bigham’s meals on its shelves.Mr Bigham plays down the difficulties of winning over supermarket buyers, describing the process as a matter of calling the switchboard and politely asking to be put through to the right person.The business quickly grew too large for leafy Notting Hill and moved to the Park Royal industrial estate in north-west London. Park Royal is no beauty spot but boasts the largest collection of food manufacturers in the country, providing Mr Bigham with a large pool of trained workers.Park Royal also has good transport links, ensuring delivery of the 300 fresh ingredients Bigham’s uses each day and distribution of finished meals to supermarket shelves.Expanding production has helped the business enjoy economies of scale in distribution costs, Mr Bigham explains.“Although people moan about it, there is a good road infrastructure. We can get a lorry from anywhere to almost anywhere very quickly, but the cost varies a lot whether you are moving a bunch of parsley or a pallet of parsley.”Last year Bigham’s moved into a purpose-built 35,000 square foot headquarters next to its initial site.The £2.5m investment ate into profits, but provided Bigham’s with a state-of-the-art kitchen to test new recipes as well as a central canteen area where Mr Bigham holds a monthly meeting with all 300 employees.Maintaining the significant growth of the business is one of Mr Bigham’s main goals. His turnover target for 2010 is £50m and he is looking at expanding the company’s manufacturing space within Park Royal to keep up with growth.Mr Bigham, who retains 100 per cent ownership of the business, says he does not have an exit strategy and rails about the tendency for small fast-growing businesses to seek a sale once they reach a certain size.“I think it is about taking a long-term view and not being greedy. A lot of people say now it is time to put my feet up and take out lots of cash [from the business]. That doesn’t strike me as sensible.”Bigham’s has broadened its range of activities into bespoke corporate catering, through a separate company called Bite Catering, and pre-prepared food for contract caterers, pubs and restaurants.It is an acknowledgement that there is a specific group of customers who will pay to eat the high-quality foods Bigham’s makes.“There is a food model which says that you take the same product and try to sell it to different customers. That is a bit boring to me. We say we have a bunch of customers of a certain sort and we want to find different ways of reaching those customers.”
404;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Workforces complain of too little training;;Imagine you own a car repair garage and buy each mechanic a magnificent set of tools so they have everything needed to do the job.But it turns out the mechanics know only how to use the hammers and screwdrivers, so it takes much longer to do the job than you had hoped. Not to mention that most of the tools are never used.This is pretty much what happens in offices around the world, research suggests, where workforces say they lack skills to operate some of the expensive IT systems employers are investing in.Just 40 per cent of computer users have received any IT training while 90 per cent of new jobs now require IT skills, according to a survey from E-Skills UK, a training organisation. The survey found 67 per cent of employers think the staff’s level of IT skills “defines” the impact on productivity.“What we’re seeing is we have an issue with the generic workforce and their ability to use IT,” says Karen Price, chief executive of E-Skills UK. “More and more workers who’ve had no experience with IT are required to know about it. Yet IT is a key driver of productivity.”Research from analyst Gartner claims that every hour of professional end-user IT training is worth at least five hours to the business. But it argues companies should realise the need for training is related to the level of complexity of IT – so if people require more training for one specific tool, it would be better to simplify the processes.Andrew Marlot, senior executive in IT effectiveness for consultancy Accenture believes employers are struggling to get the best out of IT because people are unsure of what to do. “It is getting better,” he says. “But there’s a real need for companies to focus on simplifying technology to the critical needs of the workforce. The other thing employers focus on too much is efficiency rather than effectiveness. Users have to work out how to use technology tools.“Companies need to focus on basic understanding of these tools. This has an impact on productivity. It’s an issue in the more senior professional environment just as much as the generic workforce.”At the start of the millennium, software vendors put great pressure on companies to buy into Enterprise Resource Planning systems, claiming they would boost productivity and cut costs. In retrospect however, not every company has been happy with the results.“These benefits were not realised,” says John Whitings, director of executive IT practice for recruitment company Harvey Nash. “Now it is understood the system alone will not do this – it has to be linked to business process change. There’s been a big resurgence in this and working practices are being changed to ensure systems add value. Companies that derive most value position the transformation as being business-led, rather than technology-led.”Mr Marlot adds that companies making staff more productive have also taken on new concepts.“One area that we see more discipline in is the development of the workspace,” he says. “In Toyota when they re-designed end-to-end production they created this cell-based workspace idea, making sure everything is at people’s fingertips at the workbench. Now we’re seeing more tools at the workbench on PCs too.”British Airways is one company making efforts to give its employees the tools and the skills they need to do their job. It is investing heavily in IT education and designing systems around the workforce. For example, cabin crew can access their work rota through the company intranet out of the office, much in the same way as passengers can check in online. And 95 per cent of BA’s staff use the intranet to work on, it claims.Paul Coby, chief information officer for the company, says: “Being able to use technology is a fundamental part of working at BA and any business – it’s something people need. At the moment we’ve a rolling programme of employee self-service. You don’t need to shuffle paper any more.“But you do have to make [a system] intuitive, easy to use and you have to train people. If you get it right you have some pretty well-equipped people. You can use the technology to simplify a very complex process.”The E-Skills research found age made a difference: “It’s the older people who need training. Younger people are much more in tune with it,” adds Ms Price.But Mr Coby disagrees. He says with the right training, any member of staff should be able to use the tools at hand. “People always say that but I don’t buy into it. We haven’t found any signs of it. You shouldn’t expect that people of that age can use IT the same way as people who have just left school though.”For those who need a helping hand, the BBC website offers a good starting point for anyone wanting to learn about the basics of desktop IT.There is also an International Computer Driving Licence (www.ecdl.com) that provides a solid syllabus of IT skills, and happyelearning.co.uk provides a few free tips.Yet while 2m people in the UK alone are thought to have gaps in their IT skill gaps for their jobs, and roughly a third of companies are finding it hard to fill vacancies for IT staff, business chiefs need to be aware that there is much more to investing in technology than just buying the tools.■ Dan Ilett writes for silicon.com
405;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-07-06T17:20:09Z;Low expectations for IPTV revenue in short term;;Media and telecoms executives do not have high expectations of revenues from television over broadband (internet protocol television), according to a survey by Accenture, the consulting firm, and the Economist Intelligence Unit.The report comes as an increasing number of people are expected to consume television programmes over the internet as broadband penetration rises. Younger audiences are also turning to the web as a means to find entertainment and content.This has resulted in an increasing number of companies acquiring or developing ways to deliver programmes to audiences over the internet. In the UK, for example, British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television group, has bought Easynet, a broadband provider, while BT, the telecoms group, is launching BT Vision, a video-on-demand service using broadband.However, only 4 per cent of the 300 executives from technology, media and telecoms companies in 40 countries said they expected IPTV to generate significant revenue for their industry in the coming year.While companies such as Verizon, Telecom Italia and China Netcom are trialling or offering IPTV, only 22 per cent of survey respondents believed that companies have their marketing and pricing strategies in place. Almost half of the respondents said they were not ready, according to Accenture.So far, most of the network operators offering IPTV were using it to retain customers, and to stop “churn” or subscription cancellations or defections, rather than to develop new revenue streams.Ray Dogra, global head of IPTV at Accenture, said: “The two important things to make IPTV work is to offer compelling content at the right price and making sure that people get reliable services and technical support.”A bulk of the executives surveyed showed more optimism for IPTV in the medium term. Thirty-four per cent said they strongly believed the services would be generating revenue in three years. Another 57 per cent were “somewhat confident”.
406;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-07-04T18:19:31Z;Aid superpower wants more bang for its euro;;Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day, goes the old adage. Get a western consultant to teach him how to fish and he’ll eat for life, the consultant will get rich and the government giving the money will boost its aid figures.That is the way much international aid works. Too much, according to the charity Action Aid, which on Tuesday unveiled a report detailing the extent of such so-called technical assistance.The European Union is the world’s aid superpower, giving almost €45bn of overseas development funds in 2005. Around one-fifth of this goes on technical assistance.This involves hiring contractors, overwhelmingly from the countries giving the money, to train and advise on reforms. In some cases it could be training nurses or drawing up a national education curriculum. In others it is advising on privatisations and economic reforms.The most (in)famous case is from Tanzania, where the UK’s Department for International Development, hired the Adam Smith Institute, the free market think-tank, to promote water privatisation through glossy brochures and other means. Unfortunately, when the public found that involved paying more for their water they simply refused, and two years after the private sector pulled out. Dfid has given €146m to the big five international consultancies - KPMG, Deloitte, Ernst and Young, Accenture and PriceWaterhouseCoopers - in the last five years.However, the UK is not the only one playing this game. French technical assistance can only go to appoint French nationals, for example. Of what Action Aid calls “real aid”, excluding debt relief, much technical assistance. the stingiest countries are Austria, Greece, Italy and Spain.Poor governments believe they could get better value for money by hiring locals . For example, contractors in Cambodia earn 1,000 times the civil servant’s average €31 a month salary. The key thing for local campaigners is whether the recipient country has genuine ownership and control of the reforms.The EU also wants to get more bang for its buck, especially as aid grows. Last year the 15 old member states pledged to raise spending from an average 0.39 per cent of national income to 0.51 per cent by 2010.Development commissioner Louis Michel is tackling the duplication problem, partly because he wants to hoist the blue flag over more projects. But member states have their own jealously guarded pet projects and are reluctant. Action Aid believes €3bn of aid was lost in 2004 by poor co-ordination and duplication of projects. The typical African country receives dozens of visits every month from donors assessing the use of their funds.It is understandable that after years of seeing taxpayers’ money wasted or siphoned into offshore bank accounts European governments want to account for their money.The new buzz word is governance. The Commission is establishing its latest development fund, worth about €9bn. It wants to offer the carrot of extra funding for those countries that meet around 100 criteria (and have the bureaucratic resources to show they have done so) will get extra funding from the Commission.There is also a push to join up development and trade policies. In Kenya the Commission is funding Keplotrade, the body charged with negotiating a trade (economic partnership) agreement with the EU. The Commission’s man in Kenya sits in on the talks. That funding counts as development aid. A virtuous circle indeed.
407;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-07-03T21:40:54Z;NTL ready to take on BSkyB;;"NTL’s new management is hoping to challenge British Sky Broadcasting with an aggressive expansion of the cable operator’s on-demand film offerings and a renewed commitment to television programming.“Content is going to be the battleground,” Stephen Burch said in his first interview since becoming chief executive of NTL in January. He admitted that Sky had better films and sports rights, but said he was looking for ways to exploit cable’s on-demand capabilities.“I don’t think the movie offering on Sky is as robust as it could be,” he said. He added that NTL’s merger with Telewest strengthened his hand in negotiations with film studios interested in the distribution opportunities offered by broadband, video-on-demand and pay-per-view technologies.Theresa Wise, a partner at Accenture, said NTL’s greater scale should help improve the low profit margins for video-on-demand, but cautioned that Sky spent more with Hollywood studios than any UK rival, making its deals with studios hard to break.Mr Burch, recruited from Comcast, the US cable group, after NTL and Telewest announced their merger, hopes video-on-demand will narrow the gap with Sky.“VOD will be a strong retention tool and, when people understand it better, [a customer] acquisition tool,” he said. He also plans to expand Flextech, the television content business which has a joint venture with the BBC called UKTV.“We are finding new programmes we can create and buy and ventures we can do to expand our content,” Mr Burch said.He added that relations with the BBC, which had been frustrated by its lack of US distribution, have improved since the merger.NTL is today expected to complete its £961m acquisition of Virgin Mobile, making it the first company in the UK able to offer the “quadruple play” of broadband internet access, television, and fixed-line and mobile telephony.Mr Burch said NTL would adopt the Virgin brand name for its services “no later than early next year”.

services market.The investment illustrates how seriously IBM takes the emerging rivalry of Indian information technology companies with their lower-cost model.?I am not going to miss the [India] opportunity,? Sam Palmisano, IBM?s chief executive, told a gathering of 10,000 IBM staff in Bangalore yesterday.IBM?s proposed investment is triple the sum it has already spent in India and exceeds a combined $3.9bn of investments announced by Microsoft, Intel and Cisco. Each has recruited heavily in India, pushed by global customers demanding Indian costs and expertise.IBM already employs 42,000 people at more than a dozen centres in India. Before yesterday?s announcement, IBM had been widely mentioned as a potential buyer of Sayam, India?s fourth biggest IT services company, based in Hyderabad. IBM?s investment suggests it has instead opted for organic growth.The $6bn investment will aim to strengthen IBM?s global and Indian software and business services operations and create a telecoms research unit.India?s IT groups pose a growing threat to the global status quo. As services have become more standardised, big clients have split large IT outsourcing contracts.IBM is competing with an Indian rival for a $100m mandate from a US Fortune 100 manufacturer, and last year three Indian companies shared a $2.2bn outsourcing contract from ABN Amro with IBM and Accenture."
409;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-05-30T17:15:31Z;Why the EU is worried about RFID;;For a microchip that measures just a few millimetres across, RFID has already caused a fair degree of controversy. The radio tags – used on anything from pharmaceutical products to sea containers – have prompted campaigns by privacy groups, street demonstrations in continental Europe, and conspiracy theories a-plenty.The latest organisation to step into the controversy is the European Commission, which this month held a series of workshops in Brussels as part of a consultation over the technology.The EU’s information society commissioner, Viviane Reding, wants a debate about the security and privacy issues surrounding RFID. The discussions will help the European Commission when it comes to review the EU’s e-privacy directive later this year.The EU expects the use of RFID tags to grow rapidly in the next few years, and believes a public discussion is necessary now about how they might be used, and how the data the tags provide might be protected.“We need to ask what information RFID systems gather, how long that data will be kept and who will have access to it,” said Ms Reding when the EU announced the consultation at the CeBIT technology fair in March.In part, the EU is responding to pressure from consumer and privacy groups, which have expressed concern that RFID tags could be used to build up huge databases of individuals’ shopping, leisure and travel habits. These databases could be exploited by unscrupulous businesses and also become a target for cybercriminals.The fact that RFID tags track the actual item someone buys rather than simply the type – as is the case with bar codes – has led to fears that RFID data could be far more intrusive than the information retailers already collect. And, as radio chips, RFID tags have the potential to be read at a distance without the consumer’s knowledge.So far, few RFID projects have involved placing tags on individual consumer goods. The cost of tags, as well as the equipment needed to read them and process the data, also means that item-level tagging is still some way off. Rather, companies are tagging crates, cases and containers.“Most business cases for RFID involve nothing that touches the consumer, but are based around back-end systems and the logistics chain. Most RFID tags will never reach the consumer but are on the pallet level,” says Jeroen Terstegge, corporate privacy officer at Philips and a moderator in the EU’s consultation.But concerns remain, not least because technological developments will bring down the cost of RFID tags and also increase their range and accuracy.European Commission officials are likely to be looking for evidence that the IT industry is taking such privacy and security considerations into account. And companies that are actively involved in RFID, including Philips, IBM and Accenture, are already working on privacy and security enhancement measures for RFID.Such measures could include limiting the range of tags – so that the reader would need to be in close proximity to the product, for example – encrypting the data on the tag, and providing consumers with the option to wipe the RFID chip once they have bought an item.An open debate about RFID should help consumers understand how RFID works. Retailers, including Marks and Spencer in the UK and Metro in Germany have also gone to some lengths to reassure consumers about RFID, for example by clearly labelling products that carry tags.Proponents of RFID also hope that the EU consultation will be an opportunity to present the positive elements of the technology, such as its use in preventing counterfeit drugs reaching consumers, or in aviation, where tags are being fixed to aircraft spares and safety equipment.Such deployments should be relatively uncontroversial, as are RFID deployments in other closed environments, from manufacturing sites to defence establishments and oil or chemical plants.“The work we have been doing in the pharmaceutical supply chain is one area that has clear consumer benefits,” says Stephen Proud, the partner responsible for RFID in Europe at consultant Accenture.“Few would argue that the issue of counterfeit drugs is not important to consumers. We are working with drugs companies to use RFID to improve the integrity of the supply chain. But the tags are clearly identified and are removed by the pharmacist when the product reaches the store.”And, so far, companies involved in RFID say that the EU consultation is not holding back customers’ plans for the sensors. The barriers for RFID are more often technological or financial. Moreover, there are other technologies that pose as great, if not greater, privacy questions.“We are seeing some push back on RFID plans, but it is because of technical not privacy issues,” says Duncan Brown, consulting director at analysts IDC. “We are seeing other areas where businesses are generating more and more information in a digital form, and some of this is potentially far more sinister data than what clothes you are buying.”
410;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-05-29T21:04:07Z;Winners feel the pain from billion-pound contracts;;The billion-pound contracts to implement the new IT system across the National Health Service have proved surprisingly painful for most of the winners.The project, the world’s largest civil IT scheme, aims to give patients in England a connected electronic health record that can be viewed by doctors and nurses on any NHS computer. It attracted the world’s biggest technology companies when it was launched in 2002 at a time of depressed demand from corporate customers.However, the companies that remain of the 99 that initially expressed an interest have all endured, or been responsible for, setbacks that have delayed important phases and wiped millions of pounds from some companies’ stock market value.For iSoft, a Manchester-based software developer, late delivery of its applications to NHS trusts has meant delays in cash generation that have sparked fears it could breach its banking covenants.The company, which will have to update the market when it announces annual results next month, has said its revenues will be more than £30m lower than expected. It has, though, sought to calm fears over its banking facilities.Accenture, the US technology service and consultancy group, has taken a much larger hit, partly because of separate delivery failures from iSoft. In March, it said it was allowing for losses of $450m (£260m) on its £2.1bn contracts for the north and east of England. Accenture also believes the contract itself might be worth less over its 10-year lifetime than expected because the government is allowing local healthcare providers to choose alternative systems.Attempts to renegotiate the contracts have been rebuffed by Richard Granger, head of the NHS IT programme, who says contractors in the other three regions would have to be suffering the same pain before he provided any relief to Accenture.Even though the CSC Alliance, which is operating in the north-west, has troubled iSoft as a member, it says it is not experiencing the same problems. CSC is, however, behind on its delivery of picture archiving and communications systems after its first supplier, ComMedica, was ditched.BT is responsible for patient records in London and national work vital to the project. The telecoms group was fined £300,000 two years ago for missing deadlines but has since beaten targets for laying the broadband network and says it is making good progress with the transactional database to which all the new applications will link.Fujitsu, leading a consortium in the south, says its work is on track and it aims to finish rolling out imaging systems by March next year. However, its Fujitsu Alliance has not escaped the problems dogging the project. Last year it replaced IDX Systems, which was supplying medical record software with Cerner, also from the US, causing IDX to issue a profit warning.Tata Consultancy Services, the Indian IT services company that is also part of the consortium, said glitches in the NHS work had hurt profits across its European business.
411;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-05-17T08:18:32Z;Rising energy costs to limit profits at Sainsbury;;J Sainsbury warned that a significant rise in energy costs in the second half of the year would hurt profit growth as the UK’s third largest supermarket beat analysts’ expectations but warned that market conditions remained difficult.Full-year underlying pre-tax profits increased 12.2 per cent to £267m ($506m) while like-for-like sales, excluding petrol, rose 3.7 per cent, the group said on Wednesday, as it had continued to focus on improving the quality of its food offering while matching the price reductions at competitors such as Asda and Tesco.Analysts were predicting underlying profits closer to £260m, but one said the rise was not significant as lower interest costs accounted for the difference.“The market remains challenging, but Sainsbury’s will continue to maintains its competitive position on price while building its quality food offer,” said Justin King, chief executive.Despite growing sales and customer numbers, Mr King remained downbeat about market conditions and highlighted energy costs as a significant factor that would impact profits in the next six months, saying that costs would be £55m, £15m higher than expected. However, he added that operational gearing in supermarkets was improving as increased sales and cost savings started to bear fruit.Sainsbury has now recorded five consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales and market share growth following steps taken by Mr King to revitalise the business. In the course of the last year, Sainsbury has restructured its debt which is now secured on its property portfolio to reduce interest payments, committed to pay £350m into its defined benefit pension scheme and reassumed control of its IT system from Accenture.However charges associated with the business review, IT insourcing and debt restructuring and a significant benefit from discontinued operations last year, meant that net profits fell almost 70 per cent to £58m.Jonathan Pritchard at Oriel Securities said the poor performance of Sainsbury’s bank and lower EBIT margins were slight causes for concern. However he reiterated that like-for-like growth was strong and that the energy cost hikes would not halt the sales led recovery.Steve Davis at Numis described Sainsbury’s as being “in the sweet spot” for food retailing: “There is a clear trend for customers to trade up to fresher and healthier foods and this is benefiting Waitrose, M&S and Sainsbury’s.”However, Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon was less optimistic, pointing out that under IFRS, EBIT margins of 0.6 per cent in the second half of the year had fallen well short of the target of 4 per cent. “This paints a picture of profitless sales growth, which is not what management would like as a ‘take home’ from these numbers.”Sainsbury is still the UK’s third largest supermarket behind Asda and Tesco, but its share of the market has risen to 16 per cent in the last year according to market research from Taylor Nelson Sofres, placing it just behind Asda whose share fell slightly to 16.3 per cent. Tesco still dominates with 30.8 per cent.Shares in Sainsbury have risen almost 10 per cent so far this year, but in early trading on Wednesday morning they were down 3.5 per cent at 334½p as investors decided to take advantage of the stock’s recent improvement.
412;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-05-08T17:22:07Z;New technology offers a helping hand;;This spring, technology refuseniks wanting to fly on British Airways' domestic routes were confronted with Hobson's Choice: when UK-based business travellers were questioned in a recent survey by Accenture, the consultancy, 16 per cent confessed that the reason they had not used self-service kiosks at airports to pick up their boarding cards was that they did not know how to do so. Now, unless they check-in online before leaving for the airport, they will have to learn.On April 25, the airline abandoned conventional check in for services to destinations such as Edinburgh and Manchester. It was a vivid example of the way automation is affecting every aspect of business travel, from booking to staying in touch with home while on the road.A clutch of other carriers had also introduced online check in and enabled customers to print boarding passes at home or in their offices. Similarly, many had installed machines in airport terminals. Some airports, such as Helsinki Vantaa, plan to introduce kiosks shared by airlines operating there.According to the Accenture survey, 46 per cent of travellers had used machines to check in and 72 per cent of those who had done so found it more convenient than going to the desk.Hotel companies have been warier than airlines about reducing human contact, though some have introduced similar technology. Hilton has already installed automatic kiosks to check in and out at over 200 hotels in the US, three-quarters of them Embassy Suites properties. And the group has just announced that guests using such machines at 37 Hiltons can now use them to print airline boarding cards. Holiday Inn in the US has tested similar technology and had planned to extend kiosks to many properties across the country last year. A spokeswoman, however, says that is still the company’s intention, but developing the technology to issue key cards and negotiating check-in links with airlines had taken longer than anticipated.Automation is even taking some of the frustration out of car rental. For example, National and Alamo agents can now use computer software to calculate the cost of damage when vehicles are returned, ending the usual practice of hanging on to the customer's deposit until the price of repair or replacement has been assessed and processed.Technology on aircraft and trains is making it easier to combine work and relaxation. At the end of March, nine carriers including Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Etihad and Japan Airlines were offering in-flight internet access using the Connexion by Boeing system on a total of 184 routes. According to research by Boeing, the 90 per cent use the service to check and send e-mail (most accessing corporate virtual private networks), 69 per cent browsed the web and 7 per cent made calls via their laptops using VOIP (voice over internet protocol). Some were also using the system to provide live television, currently in the forms of BBC World, EuroNews, Eurosportnews, CNBC and MSNBC.When it comes to entertainment, the latest AVOD (audio and video on demand) systems such as those installed by Emirates and Air New Zealand, enable passengers on long flights to choose from a wide range of movies, for example, and to stop and restart them exactly when they want.Rail operators are increasingly providing laptop power points and wireless internet access. They include the UK's GNER, which plans to equip its entire fleet for wi-fi connections by August, nine months ahead of the deadline originally planned. When the move was announced in March, the company’s chief executive Christopher Garnett said: “Wireless internet is already proving popular and versatile on board the ten trains which already have it. We are keen to bring the benefits to all passengers as quickly as we can.”But while all these developments are making the process of travelling more efficient, and in some cases less tedious, there is no doubt that the biggest impact of technology on travel has been the area of buying and selling it.On the positive side this has saved time and cut costs. E-auction tools are available, for example, which help speed up the annual process of seeking competitive, negotiated deals with from suppliers. American Express Travel recently launched one that enables meetings organisers to solicit offers from venues. Short-listed venues can then bid against each other to provide peripheral services such as catering. Attracting bookings via their websites has helped full service airlines to reduce the amount they pay in fees to the major computer reservations network operators (GDSs or global distribution systems), hold down distribution costs and compete more effectively with no-frills rivals. Ease of comparing prices online, not least through self-booking tools has also helped keep costs in check.On the minus side, the proliferation of online booking channels has sparked price confusion and anarchy. Hotel groups have been forced to issue guarantees that they will match or better rates on other people's websites that undercut those on their own. As online self-booking increases, either through dedicated corporate tools or via the internet at large, travel managers have been faced with staff finding fares lower than those negotiated with airlines approved by their companies. This has made it harder for companies to achieve targets for bulk business agreed in return for discounts.Providers of self-booking tools already build-in checks to ensure employees explain why they have strayed from company travel policy but by the time the travel manager finds but what has happened the damage may already have been done.Norman Gage, business travel director of the UK's Advantage travel agents' consortium, estimates that only about 6 per cent of members currently provide some or all of their corporate clients with self-booking tools. “People always need people. Technology cannot deal with the sort of problems that occurred during the recent Gate Gourmet catering strike at Heathrow, for example. And I have sat next to people at airports who have made mistakes booking online who had to pay for a ticket all over again.”If a passenger presses the wrong button booking direct, he says, the airline may be intransigent. “If a travel agent does it, it's down to the agent. But he believes that in the not too distant future, say in ten years time, perhaps 90 per cent of trips will be organised using such tools. “It will be hi-tech, low-touch. There will probably be fewer travel agents and those that remain will need fewer staff.”
413;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-05-02T21:05:27Z;Morgan Stanley arm sold Isoft shares before big falls;;The trading arm of Morgan Stanley, which acts as financial adviser and broker to Isoft, has twice sold significant stakes in the struggling software developer shortly before sharp falls in Isoft’s share price.Morgan Stanley Securities Limited built up a stake of 6.4 per cent on behalf of clients in the week following an Isoft profit warning in January, when it warned it faced a £55m revenue shortfall because of delays to the £6.2bn programme to upgrade the NHS computer system. The warning knocked 45 per cent off the share price in one day. Morgan Stanley consistently held stakes for clients of 4-6.2 per cent in Isoft from February 10 until March 23, when it told Isoft it no longer had a notifiable interest in the group’s shares – that is, it held less than 3 per cent.On March 29, Accenture, Isoft’s partner on some of the NHS contracts, warned of a $450m (£246m) blow to its revenues, which it blamed on Isoft. That sent Isoft shares down 12 per cent.On March 31, regulatory filings showed Morgan Stanley Securities had bought up a 7.9 per cent stake, again for clients, and held 6.8-7.4 per cent until April 20, when the broker again told Isoft that it no longer had a notifiable interest. Last Friday, Isoft again warned on profits on the last day of its financial year, knocking another 16 per cent of its shares.Traders raised eyebrows at the sales, as Morgan Stanley continues to act as a joint financial adviser to Isoft. But the bank said there was no link between its trading arm and its corporate finance arm, and it had very strong Chinese walls between the two. “The two are completely separate businesses,” it said.As a corporate broker to Isoft, Morgan Stanley also commands a large pool of stock in order to allow investors to trade shares more easily. Isoft shares closed up ¾p at 118¼p.
414;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Isoft profit warning see shares drop 16%;;Isoft, the software developer chosen to overhaul the National Health Service’s IT systems, on Friday confirmed long-held investor suspicions by issuing a profit warning.The company, which issued a severe profit warning in January because of delays to its NHS work, said the latest shortcomings were not linked to its health service contracts.Investors have been concerned about the future of the NHS contract, which accounts for a large slice of the Manchester-based group’s earnings. News the problems had spread to other parts of the business was a surprise.Analysts expected full-year profits, due out in July, of £24m-£42m, but yesterday Isoft said profit was unlikely to exceed £22m.Since early April Isoft’s shares have taken investors on a rollercoaster ride, falling when analysts published notes questioning its balance sheet accounting, and later on rumours of an NHS-related profit warning, only to soar on unconfirmed reports that rival Misys was plotting to buy the company.The January profit warning alerted the market to problems with its NHS business, and concerns intensified shortly after when Accenture, the US consulting firm, blamed Isoft, its subcontractor on the NHS contract, for some of its own losses.Analysts at Investec this month said the company’s apparent practice of making loans to itself could hurt cashflow. “The company has effectively received cash up front for work that it has committed to do in the future,” said Investec.Also of concern was the decline in the amount of money the company had on hand to cover unexpected costs or customers’ defaulting on payments.The latest profit warning prompted further speculation that Isoft could soon be consumed by another company.Misys, the UK software company whose rumoured interest this week boosted Isoft’s shares, has been selling insurance businesses in favour of healthcare units, said Gareth Healy, director of corporate finance at Close Brothers.Isoft shares fell 16.5 per cent to 117½p, making its market cap £271m.
415;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-03-30T00:51:17Z;Tom Horton returns as CFO to American Airlines;;Tom Horton is leaving AT&T to become chief financial officer at American Airlines, a position he vacated four years ago to join the telecommunications group.The US airline had initially said it was focused on an internal hire to fill the slot left by James Beer, who resigned in February to join Symantec, the software security group.He becomes American’s fourth CFO in as many years, and the departure of his predecessors to other sectors – coupled to a parade of senior departures at other airlines – had fuelled the concern in recent months about executive retention within the industry, a debate intensified by union opposition to management pay agreements.Delta Air Lines has warned that management attrition had risen eight-fold since the group filed for bankruptcy protection last September, and fellow Chapter 11 carrier Northwest has also lost staff.Mr Horton spent 17 years at American before joining AT&T, where he rose to become vice-chairman ahead of the group’s $67bn bid for rival BellSouth earlier this month. The airline described the hire as “a bold move” to position the company “with a strong leader from outside the airline industry.The airline also announced the planned retirement of Pete Dolara, who spearheaded its expansion to become the largest airline flying into central America. Craig Kreeger, the head of its European and Asian business, has been promoted to become senior vice-president international.UK-born Mr Beer joined AMR, American’s parent, in 1991 from Andersen Consulting and assumed the CFO role in December 2003 when Jeff Campbell left to join McKesson, the consulting firm. He in turn took over from Mr Horton in 2002.Mr Beer’s base salary at AMR was about half that of Gregory Myers, who retired as Symantec’s CFO at the end of last year.American has pledged to review its executive compensation strategy amid widespread employee discontent over plans that could result in 1,000 top managers receiving more than $70m in cash bonuses this year.
416;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-03-29T17:10:22Z;London shares climb as bid talk returns;;The London stock market rallied on Wednesday as mergers and acquisition speculation returned after an unusual lull this week.The rumour mill had been relatively quiet this week but it was back in action, helping the FTSE 100 regain recent losses.The bluechip benchmark finished 23.5 points or 0.5 per cent to 5,959.2, partly correcting the 100 point loss seen in the previous two sessions. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index added 4.7 points or 0.1 per cent to 9,820.8. Volume was an average 3.3bn shares.BG Group was the centre of most of the talk, gaining 4.3 per cent to a record high of 734p, following reports of with bid interest from Exxon, the world’s largest listed oil group. A potential price of 900p per share mooted, putting a price tag of around £31bn on BG.Traders suggested that Exxon was interested in BG’s oil and gas assets in Kazakhstan. The interest in the stock was enough to offset the drag caused by the stock moving ex-dividend.Royal Bank of Scotland added 0.7 per cent to £18.52 as dealing room rumours suggested that Wachovia, the US bank, was mulling a bid at £26 a share. Speculation earlier in the week had linked Citigroup with a bid for RBS.J Sainsbury, the supermarket, rose 1.6 per cent to 332¼p after it reported a rise in sales for a fifth successive quarter.Intercontinental Hotels firmed 3 per cent to 928p after UBS upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “buy”, saying it expected earnings to recover and saw potential for a takeover.Sugar maker Tate & Lyle fell 1.8 per cent to 575½p after flagging that reform of the EU’s sugar regime would lead it to report a “substantial” impairment, to be quantified in May, of assets and goodwill relating to the business units affected.Marks & Spencer rose 1.6 per cent to 558½p on talk that the group would shortly announce a major expansion into India, possibly involving up to 200 stores. However, people familar with the situation played down the talk.ISoft, the healthcare software supplier, dropped 15.8 per cent to 148½p after the US consultancy Accenture warned of “signficant delays” on software deliveries critical to the NHS National Programme, where Isoft is a contractor. Accenture said it would take a $450m provision for future losses relating to contract. Despite the heavy fall, several analysts said there was very little in Accenture’s statement that was not already widely known.Hikma Pharmaceuticals, the Jordon-based generic drugs company that floated in London last November, added 4.6 per cent to 408p after it reported surging full-year sales. It added that it expected to expand through acquisitions in 2006.CSR gained 6.8 per cent to £11.16 on talk it had won a contract to supply its Bluetooth wireless technology for phones made by LG, the South Korean group.Burren Energy shed 7.3 per cent to 953p after rival Tullow Oil reported disappointing drilling news on the M’Boundi oil field at onshore Congo in West Africa.At a presentation to investors following its own full-year results, Tullow said a well on the north-west edge M’Boundi field was dry.Analysts said the news further delineated the northern extent of the field after recent well failures on the north east boundary.Burren holds 31 per cent of the rights to the field, compared with Tullow’s 11 per cent and analysts estimate the field accounts for around half of Burren’s net asset value.Many realised the implication for Burren during the meeting. “It was one of those race-for-the-door-before-anyone-else scenarios,” said an analyst present.Richard Rose, an analyst at Oriel Securities, said the news had reduced the chances of their being further upside to Burren’s estimates of 320m barrels of oil equivalent from the field.“We believe the shares remain expensive and the reaction to the news is not overdone,” he said as he kept his ‘reduce’ rating.Burren is expected to revise its estimates with its full-year results, published on Thursday. Tullow lost 0.1 per cent to 348½p.Brit Insurance Holdings gained 7.7 per cent to 98p after the high court ruled it could move £180m from its share premium account to increase reserves distributable as dividends.Its shares fell earlier in the month after Brit warned it would revise its dividend policy, paying out 50 per cent of earnings to a minimum of 5p, rather than the previous 70 per cent.Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries, the pub operator, firmed 5.5 per cent to £13.00 as its trading update reported a rise 24-week sales and operating margins.
417;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-03-29T13:19:26Z;March 29: Ferrovial noses closer to landing BAA;;March 29: The prospects of a firm bid emerging for BAA, the airports group, improved today when it was announced that Ferrovial of Spain had brought Macquarie Bank of Australia on to its team. Macquarie will be an adviser to Ferrovial and, if the BAA bid succeeds, will buy Ferrovial’s stakes in Sydney and Bristol airports. BAA shares are little changed this morning: this diminishes the chances of an auction developing. However, it also makes it more likely that Ferrovial will bid – Macquarie cannot really afford another public failure so soon after its aborted LSE bid – and it should make it easier for Ferrovial to bid more than the 810p it has proposed. Ferrovial has been given until April 24 to put up or shut up.Shares in Isoft, the software group, fell more than 14 per cent after Accenture linked it with difficulties it is having with a very large NHS software contract. The consultant, which is on the same project as Isoft, says it has had to set aside $450m for losses on the NHS contract because of higher development costs and installation delays. Accenture laid part of the blame at Isoft’s door. There is some speculation in the market that Isoft may need to restate its results but the company says nothing has changed since it alerted the market to difficulties it was having with the contract in January.BG shares rose almost 5 per cent this morning on rumours, fuelled by a piece in the Independent, that Exxon Mobil is preparing to bid 900p a share for it. We’re checking it out but I have my doubts: Exxon takes a very conservative view on energy prices and bidding for BG with prices at these levels would amount to a big change.Stand by for news of an improved proposal from the Goldman Sachs-led consortium bidding for control of ITV. However, we’re not taking too seriously suggestions that their candidate to replace Charles Allen as chief executive, Greg Dyke, wants to merge ITV with Channel 5. Very amusing to read in The Times this morning that Allen is selling his house in Kensington. What The Times didn’t say was that Allen lives just a couple of doors down from Richard Sharp, the man in charge of European principal investments for Goldman Sachs. It looks like Allen will do anything to get away from his predator.The rehabilitation of J Sainsbury continues with the supermarket group announcing its fifth straight quarter of improved sales. This is being driven in large part by price cuts, so you have to worry about margins. The shares are up 2½ per cent.The other important news today is that Invensys has set out a nine-year plan to tackle its pensions deficit. This will include a one-off payment by the company of £105m. Last year, Invensys was the company with the largest pensions deficit when compared with its market capitalisation of any company in the FTSE 350.Make or read a comment online now, click here
418;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-02-22T15:22:05Z;Management consultancy: Shake-out may be over;;"The shake-out in management consultancy looks as though it may be over, the after-effects of irrational exuberance in the 1990s largely exorcised, although the memories still have an impact on decision making.Fiona Czerniawska, director of the Management Consultants Association think-tank and author of the MCA’s annual reports on the state of the industry, says: “Over-capacity around the time of the dot.com boom was probably 20 to 25 per cent and there was a considerable shedding of staff, but since then there has been something of a recovery”.It was the higher, more expensive echelons in an industry whose insiders still speak of the ‘ridiculous and unrealistic salaries’ of the 1990s that were squeezed out.Ms Czerniawska calculates that numbers employed director or partner level fell by around one quarter between 2002 and 2004, with the 12 per cent reduction in 2004 contrasted with expansion at other levels in an industry she currently estimates employs around 62,000 people.Her most recent report, for 2004-5, shows the wariness left by that experience. It quotes Fiona Driscoll of consulting firm Hedra as saying: “The market seems to peak and trough more than it used to. Everyone is either doing something or nothing ; the market seems to be much more stop-start, and that can create unreasonable expectations.”Ms Czerniawska points to three broad levels of recruitment – recent graduates who join as trainees, 28 to 32 year olds who have completed a traineeship with a large company and possibly an MBA and now want to move into consultancy, and experienced mid-career people who bring their experience and expertise from a particular industry or sector into consulting.It is this last group that has been most in demand recently. Ms Czerniawska explains: “There’s a consistent trend towards more specialist skills and knowledge. People who bring in a specialist knowledge of a sector can provide an edge provided they have the other attributes you need to be a succesful consultant.”Jonathan Berney, a partner at consultants EC Harris, notes their appeal for an industry made risk-averse by the peaks and troughs spoken of by Driscoll. He says: “Their knowledge and contacts mean they can deliver results more rapidly. They’re also more mature and experienced people.”It is the people just below that level, the victims of the contraction of recent years, who appear harder to find – the 2004-5 report cited shortages “at middle levels in the consulting pyramid, positions which would previously have been filled by young project managers with 2-5 years experience”.Graduate recruitment is dominated by the 15-20 largest firms in the sector, who can give their recruits the experience indispensable to any consultancy role as junior members of teams working on large contracts.Accenture recruits 500 university leavers gradually, and expect more than 5000 applications for posts which start at £28,500. They can look forward to 300 hours or more of on-the-job training inside the first two years.Recruitment lead Julia Harvie-Liddel points to broad academic requirements of an Upper Second – with no rules about which subject - and decent A levels, plus a range of personal skills: “We look people with social skills, self-awareness and the ability to communicate who can articulate ideas, work in times and pick things up very quickly – adaptability is vital.” She describes herself as ‘broadly happy’ with the talent on offer to her company.Numeracy and computer literacy are pretty much a given in this market, Mr Berney, whose middle-sized consultancy also recruits graduates, warns that you can have too much of a good thing: “The MBA who can’t switch his laptop on is a thing of the past. If anything we have gone a little too far the other way. You are now seeing the Playstation generation who are extremely comfortable with technology and prone to be so fascinated by Black Berrys and other gadgets that they’re wont to forget that they’re business tools rather than an end in themselves.”Consultancy has long been one of the core target markets for those with newly-minted Master in Business Administration (MBA) degrees, but it is not only the contraction of recent years that is making job-seeking harder for them. Ms Harvie-Liddel says that Accenture has never taken large numbers of MBAs, concentrating its recruitment on a few institutions including London Business School and INSEAD. Berney says: “A great MBA is not necessarily going to make a great consultant. They may not have the skills in influencing people, team-building or leadership that you must have in consultancy.”Ms Czerniawska points to a debate on the business school curriculum in which academics, such as Henry Mintzberg of McGill University, Montreal, are as critical as employers. She says: “There is a desire for the business schools to focus on practice as well as theory and to give people more of the problem-solving skills that you need in consultancy. This is not to say that MBAs are worthless or that the schools are being unresponsive – they’re responding to the debate, but it is still at its very early stages.”"
419;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;China’s war for talent hots up;;"The China of the early 1980s was not a place Gong Li imagined he would re­turn to for more than a brief visit. It was emerging from the dark days of the Cultural Revolution and though Mr Li was a student at one of the country’s best universities, Shanghai’s Fudan university, he decided to grasp an opportunity to leave the country and study in the US.After completing his studies in Houston, he joined Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) in 1985. Partners there had high hopes for him. Mr Li says: “They told me, ‘You will be ideal to go back to China. There will be a market out there, but we don’t know when.’”But he has come full circle. Today, the 48-year-old is chairman of Accenture in greater China, where he leads 2,400 consultants.Mr Li is an example of a hai gui, or “sea turtle”, the Chinese term for those who left China to study and work overseas but are now “swimming home” to take high-level positions at multinational companies.These “returnees” are sought after by large companies not only for their fluency in Mandarin but also for their understanding of China’s complex history, political system and cultural and social mores – knowledge that can mean the difference between success and failure in one of the most important markets of the future.In contrast to the days when multinationals readily parachuted western expatriates into China on packages that cost as much as $1m, they have been aggressively filling top management positions in China with “local” talent. This broad term includes mainland China returnees, ethnic Chinese from countries such as Taiwan and staff hired and cultivated in China.The task of hiring top Chinese executives is made more challenging by a dearth of qualified candidates. A report from executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles gives several reasons for this: education and work opportunities of many now aged 50-60 were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution; the local talent pool was depleted by China’s “brain drain” of the 1980s and 1990s; there are few strong business schools in China; and local Chinese executives often lack global know-how.“Companies want to localise but the majority of people who are local mainland Chinese don’t have experience with global business principles,” says Joy Chen, principal at Heidrick & Struggles.The “war for talent” in China reaches to the highest management levels. Morgan Stanley this month poached Wei Christianson from Citigroup to head its China business. Microsoft sued Google when its senior researcher, Kai-Fu Lee, in 2004 defected to head the search engine’s research and development centre in China.Executive search firms are using unconventional means to identify qualified Chinese, who are not well documented in formal company rosters. Heidrick & Struggles 18 months ago began a big initiative to build a database of potential candidates by tapping networks used by Chinese émigrés, such as alumni associations of Chinese universities, civic associations, churches and recreational clubs.Ideal candidates often attended university in China and graduate school in the west, have five to 25 years of career experience overseas and hold senior mid-management to executive level positions in multinationals.This group represents the cream of the crop: just after the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s, less than
1 per cent of Chinese high school students were admitted to university. And of those who graduated, only those with the strongest academic and political connections went abroad for further study.As a result, the lucky few can command sky-high salaries. Pay packages for top-level managers in China are comparable to those of their counterparts in the US, easily running into hundreds of thousands of dollars.Even when qualified candidates are located, it is not certain that they would be willing to return to China. But in the past five years there has been more interest from overseas Chinese as big potential for career development in China beckons.This is especially true if in America someone has hit the “glass ceiling”, the invisible barrier said to keep women and minorities from reaching upper-level management. “Maybe they speak English with an accent or weren’t in a fraternity in college. Those kinds of things can lock them out of management jobs in the US,” says Ms Chen. “But it’s those bicultural attributes that can be a big advantage going back.”Haoyu Shen, a vice-president at American Express in New York, feels the allure of China’s boom. Mr Shen, 35, fits the profile. He was born in Shanghai, attended Renmin University in China and received his MBA from the University of Iowa.After working for McKinsey, the management consultancy, as well as AmEx, Mr Shen says: “There is much more excitement in China and more upside than working in the US, but there is also more risk.”Mr Shen also acknowledges that “you can have a comfortable life in the US but unless you’re really, really good, it is hard to advance professionally.”In response to soaring demand for executive re­cruitment in China, Korn/Ferry, a recruitment firm, moved its Asia headquarters from Singapore to Shanghai last year.Charles Tseng, president of Korn/Ferry in Asia, says the ideal manager can bridge the cultural gap between local Chinese and western managers – but this requires understanding of their different leadership styles.According to a study conducted by Korn/Ferry and Peking University, Chinese leaders were more inclined to use “task-oriented” and “intellectual” management styles than their western counterparts. These styles focus on “rules and procedures”; and “demanding goals and strong opinions supported by data”.By comparison, western managers and leaders from Asia’s “four dragons” – Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea – tended to emphasise “participative leadership”, which relies on consensus and team-building, as well as “social leadership”, or engaging others in a positive way.Managers typically adopt participative and social leadership as they move into more demanding roles, while task and intellectual styles tend to be found at the entry level, says Korn/Ferry.When these conclusions were shared at a conference attended by mainland Chinese business leaders last year, “they were totally astounded there was this difference”, says Mr Tseng.Once a top Chinese manager is hired, companies face the equally pressing challenge of retention. Turnover is high and it is not uncommon for Chinese executives to leave a company to bump up their salaries. At Pepsi­Co’s 400-strong sales team in Guangzhou, turnover was about 50 per cent in 2000. After setting up better systems for staff feedback, the company cut attrition in half over three years.Also recognised is the need not only to use outside talent but to develop local people who have not lived outside China. “The mindset needs to be less about acquisition,” says Andrew Grant, a director who leads McKinsey’s greater China practice. “It needs to be more about commitment to building your own talent.”Companies are recruiting not just from China’s top few universities but from the top 10. Mr Grant emphasises hybrid teams of locals and expatriates. He notes that McKinsey sends some Chinese recruits to Frankfurt for a year or two to ex­pose them to experiences such as opera and wine-tasting.For all the feverish scrambling for Chinese talent, recruitment firms and consultancies cautioned against assuming that an ethnic Chinese background would guarantee success in China.Highly westernised mainland Chinese returning to China may encounter great difficulty understanding the environment, while an ad­aptable, resilient westerner could be highly successful.“It is dangerous to say there is only one way in China,” says Mr Grant.Planting seeds of successWhile many companies are looking outside their ranks for top Chinese talent, Accenture nurtured its own “sea turtle”. After Gong Li joined the company in 1985, he worked in the US and Argentina. Moving to Hong Kong in 1993 he built Accenture’s business in Shanghai and Beijing and began to “plant seeds” for the future. He recruited 20 graduates a year from China’s top four universities and assigned them to projects in the US, Singapore and Malaysia to get experience with multinational companies.Now Accenture chairman in greater China, Mr Li says he had a crucial mentor. After he ended his three years in Hong Kong, Bill Green, then a senior partner and today Accenture’s chief executive, took him into his US group to give him experience with high-tech and electronics industries. “Bill believed China would play an important role in high tech in the future,” says Mr Li.Then Mr Green assigned him to a large outsourcing project to prepare him for a return to China in 1999. “He went beyond what a partner would typically do and took a counsellor role too,” Mr Li recalls.Mr Li says his Chinese roots give him a big advantage in forging connections in China. While foreign managers must get government clearance to gain an audience with Chinese leaders, Mr Li has easier entry into executive offices after the initial connection is made. “They think of me as Chinese first,” he says.Career advancement is vital for retention, along with pay levels and a strong corporate culture. Mr Li plans to stay in China until he retires and frequently tells his Chinese recruits: “I’m not going to leave until many of you here become partners.”"
420;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-01-24T17:07:18Z;Complimentary solutions?;;Fans of knowledge management see it as a potent tool for transforming a company’s most important asset. But critics argue knowledge management is an oxymoron.Information, by contrast, seems more manageable and tangible. So vendors of information management tools such as business intelligence (BI) are given a warmer reception than those peddling knowledge management.The IT industry has traditionally presented BI and KM as complementary solutions to a common problem: how to make sense of the mass of information held by any modern business.“BI is about analysing data while KM is about sharing content but both approaches are complementary and they are not dependent on one another,” says Shari Rogalski, global executive director for BI at Accenture.BI software extracts data from databases and turns them into human-readable reports. KM, by contrast, has its roots in linguistics and aims to help organisations share and apply the “hidden” knowledge of employees.However, the boundaries between BI and KM have become blurred over the past decade and neither has lived up to early expectations. This is certainly the case for KM, which has suffered the hype typical of management fads.In spite of the emergence of “social” technologies such as wikis and weblogs, most organisations lack the culture and processes needed to promote the organising and sharing of knowledge. Experts say KM initiatives that do not address these are doomed to fail – as many pioneers have discovered to their cost.Another problem is coming up with a workable definition of KM – and knowledge itself. Most people would accept that knowledge is different from information, but in what way exactly?Software vendors skirt round this philosophical challenge and typically present knowledge as a more valuable type of information. That has led them to attach the KM label to a bewildering range of software, including portals, document management systems, query and reporting tools and online analytical processing (Olap) systems. To add confusion, many of these technologies also feature in BI offerings.SAP, the leading enterprise software company, prefers not to take sides and claims its NetWeaver technology supports both camps. Richard Brown, head of BI for SAP, says some customers buy NetWeaver to use as a standalone BI engine, using features such as data mining, alerts and pattern matching.Others prefer to put NetWeaver at the centre of a more ambitious knowledge-sharing initiative using the enterprise portal component of NetWeaver and its enterprise search capabilities. “Some customers want to go beyond BI and get the bigger picture using contextual information,” says Mr Brown.According to Lee Phillips, director of knowledge solutions at FAST, the Norwegian search engine specialist, the key to understanding the difference between BI and KM lies not so much in the underlying technologies but in the problem they are trying to solve.BI tools concentrate on analysing structured information held in databases – personnel records, regional sales figures and so on. KM, by contrast, tries to capture and make sense of unstructured information that lies outside databases, such as emails, slides, web pages and so on.“Organisations want to put all their unstructured information on the same footing as the data they analyse using BI,” says Mr Phillips.One of the fastest growing types of unstructured information is emails. As financial regulators discovered after the dotcom crash, emails can provide a far more accurate picture of what is really going on inside a business.Wall Street regulators seized private emails that revealed investment banks knew their analysts were writing bullish reports on dotcom stocks they privately felt to be unsound. The scandal cost the companies concerned $1.4bn.“Unstructured information is every bit as important as structured information but the difference is that humans are not good at analysing it because of the natural ambiguity of language,” says Mr Phillips.Business language is usually less forthright and meanings can be highly ambiguous. So the hard work in KM lies in definitions.“There is a lot of work in getting everyone on board because the whole concept is kind of fuzzy,” says Ms Rogalski.Experts say KM can work well if everyone agrees on the semantics and the task is not too complex. But it is clear KM has not lived up to its promise and the technology has not developed as rapidly as BI. “BI has a lot more traction than KM because it addresses a very concrete business problem,” says Mr Brown.This lead looks set to grow as BI vendors such as Business Objects and SAS Institute add capabilities that work with unstructured data.In the longer term, Ms Rogaski believes the disciplines of BI and KM will converge and disappear as mainstream vendors such as Oracle, Microsoft and SAP snap up BI, KM and enterprise search specialists to incorporate their technologies into their own software suites.
421;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-01-24T16:58:29Z;Accenture helps predict the unpredictable;;Online auctions have been one of the internet’s great success stories in recent years, prospering where other businesses have failed as users flock to sites such as eBay to sell unwanted goods and pick up bargains.In the US, consumer online auction sales are expected to top $65bn by 2010 and account for nearly one-fifth of all internet retail sales, says analyst Forrester Research. Growth is also expected in Europe where eBay already has 34m users and in Asia, where China saw online auctions double in popularity last year.But while bidders are landing themselves cut-price cars, computers and other consumer goods, sellers run the risk that auctioned items could fall short of achieving their hoped-for price, says Rayid Ghani, a researcher at IT consultancy Accenture.For the past two years Mr Ghani and a team of scientists at the company’s laboratories in Chicago have been working on a computer program that attempts to remove seller uncertainty by predicting the outcome of an auction.“We have developed machine-learning techniques that use data from thousands of online auctions to predict various characteristics of an auction, including the end price the item reaches,” he says.The company is now looking to attract the interest of insurance and online auction companies, who could use the predictive software to offer sellers an insurance policy that guarantees they receive their hoped-for price.“Rather than derive an optimal strategy for offering insurance, our intent is to give the provider all the information required to price it,” says Mr Ghani.Using Accenture’s own technology and Clementine data mining tools from software company SPSS, the computer program analyses characteristics of the seller, such as their feedback score, rating and for how long they have sold goods. It then uses this information alongside data about the product being sold, auction details and knowledge from similar sales in the past.“Our algorithms output a price prediction for each item as well as a confidence score and a company can then use its actuarial expertise to price the risk and determine the insurance premium.” The idea is that the seller pays a fee to an insurer to guarantee an agreed sale price for the auction item. If it should it go for less then the seller would be reimbursed the difference.“I would be happy to pay an extra few dollars if I knew that my camera would sell for the price I wanted,” he says.From a two-month trial, which tested the predictive software on Pocket PC PDA sales, Accenture estimates insurers could have made profits of $1.95 per auction item and monthly revenues of $87,000 on this category.“As information keeps coming in, the machine keeps learning and builds on the existing model. When someone submits a new auction then it predicts the new price based on the extra information,” says Mr Ghani.But Forrester Research analyst Hellen Omwando, while seeing the potential advantages of the system, questions whether the predictive software will be able to expand to cover categories, such as rare antiques or the auctioning of services, including gardening or house cleaning.“It’s an interesting move to provide a safety net for small to medium sized businesses and individual sellers,” she says. “It seems like a scenario where everyone wins, but very rarely is that the case with insurance. How can the algorithm account for antiques, future services or emerging technologies where there is little data?”Accenture agrees that the software is currently inappropriate when it comes to predicting prices for rare goods, such as art or antiques, where it is impossible to analyse historic sales data.Mr Ghani says abnormal changes to supply and demand can also have the occasional strange effect on a prediction, but this is swiftly corrected by the software. “We saw during our testing of PDAs that prices suddenly plummeted. At first, we didn’t know why. Only later, did we learn that Dell had a promotion where they gave a free PDA away with every server purchased, resulting in extra PDAs flooding the market on eBay,” he says.It is also debatable whether a seller would buy online auction price insurance instead of setting a paid-for minimum bid price for the auction or a secret reserve, where bidders do not know the value of the floor, says Ms Omwando.But Mr Ghani points to research by Rama Katkar from Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, which says that secret reserve prices can deter bidders from participating in an auction and reduces the likelihood of a sale. He says findings from the research show that only 46 per cent of secret reserve auctions resulted in a sale, compared with 70 per cent of public minimum bids.“But when you have an auction that is being insured, the bidder doesn’t know anything about it and, as it’s not like a minimum reserve price, it doesn’t have an effect on the bid,” says Mr Ghani.Irrespective of whether insurance companies seize on the data mining tool, Mr Ghani says it has many other applications.“A different application would be to use it to work out how best you can develop an auction. By looking at data on previous successful auctions you could ask: ‘How do I get the most money?’ and discover the right times and ways to sell.”
422;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-01-24T16:58:25Z;Keeping the know-how of a retiring generation;;"If the average age of the scientists in your company’s R&D department is 48, surely there is no need to worry yet about losing expertise if one of them retires? Wrong, says David DeLong: “I want to know which of the key people are 56, 58 or 60 – who is getting ready to walk out the door.”Mr DeLong, a consultant and research fellow at MIT’s AgeLab and author of a book* on the implications of an ageing workforce, is one of several experts urging organisations to work harder at ensuring that the knowledge held only in employees’ heads is not lost when they leave the company or retire.It is not just the ageing workforce that organisations need to bear in mind, experts say. Over the next few years, the oldest of the 76m to 78m US baby-boomers will reach retirement age, and the post-second world war population bulge is repeated elsewhere.Stir in other demographic trends, such as the falling birth rate in some European countries, and that ought to be enough stimulus for organisations to recognise the need to capture and retain the knowledge and expertise that is never written down – one of the main aims of a set of practices known as knowledge management (KM).“For a long time KM has been a solution looking for a problem, and it has finally found it,” says Mr DeLong.Judging by a global study** of 1,400 workers aged between 40 and 50, conducted last year by Accenture, the experts have failed so far to instil a sense of urgency. Nearly four in 10 respondents said their organisations did not have a formal process and/or tools for capturing their workplace knowledge.When it comes to retiring, 27 per cent said they expected to be let go without any transfer of knowledge and only 17 per cent expected an intensive, months-long process of knowledge transfer. “There was not a lot of clear focus about how to capture the knowledge in people’s heads,” says Peter Cheese, global head of Accenture’s human performance practice.Many companies are aware of the demographic issues but not sure how concerned they should be. “There is a specific worry, but there is still a lot of debate across the organisation,” says Scott Shaffar, director of knowledge management at Northrop Grumman’s integrated systems business. “Is it a crisis, or something that will gradually affect us – because it is really hard to predict when the baby-boomers are going to retire given the changing financial conditions that are out there.”Northrop Grumman is very similar to many other aerospace companies and to some of its customers, says Mr Shaffar, as a large proportion of its workforce are baby-boomersUnfortunately, implementing effective KM has been a task beyond many companies, in part because they have put too much faith in IT as a solution. Mr Cheese says the technology has not been flexible enough to support the very real challenges of KM, and companies have often focused on technologies that act like libraries – giving a structure and taxonomy to corporate information – when KM is really about tacit knowledge retained by individual employees.This “social context of knowledge” is often overlooked, says Eric Lesser, an expert in human capital issues at IBM Business Consulting Services and author of a report*** on ageing workforce issues.“Performance in highly competitive marketplaces requires workers armed with knowledge that goes beyond the explicit information contained in manuals and databases. There is an increasing need to tap into the experience, intuition and social networks of employees,” says Mr Lesser.What Mr Cheese calls the “touchy-feely stuff” is every bit as important as IT in achieving this. “Technology can enable and help, but if a company does not have a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration, all the technology in the world isn’t going to help,” he says.But KM’s touchy-feely side makes it particularly hard to achieve a neat, measurable return on investment in the supporting technology. Additionally, the costs of lost knowledge are largely hidden, and do not show up on balance sheets, says Mr DeLong.“Managers as a whole have not been educated to see intellectual property as an asset in the way that money is,” agrees John Kay, a member of the management group at PA Consulting Group. “If the average company managed its money in the way it managed its IP, it wouldn’t be in business.”For too long, he says, companies have talked about KM as if it is an end in itself, but it can only be a means to an end – improving the company’s business performance. “Like IT, KM has set itself up as a discipline in its own right. Managers have been intimidated by the way it is discussed.”There is, finally, the question of who takes responsibility for implementing KM within organisations. Some companies have appointed, at boardroom level, knowledge managers who can influence the direction of the company, says Mr Kay, but others in the role have been glorified IT managers, who can organise the information but cannot influence the cultural aspects of KM.“Authority is distributed, so it’s very difficult to put it in,” he says. “Like the issue of how to get benefits out of IT, it’s part of everybody’s job.”It is little wonder, therefore, that most companies’ achievements in KM have been more discrete than all-embracing. “We’ve worked with many companies that have managed this issue well within key knowledge domains – such as R&D, engineering, and field service,” says Jim Murphy, research director at AMR Research. “It seems that many are just beginning to deal with the issues on a much more global basis – for all employees [people with domain knowledge, relationship knowledge, and key intellectual property in their heads].”Experts such as Mr Kay and Mr DeLong point to several instances of companies that have recognised the need for effective KM. BP wins praise on the technology side for its expert locator system that helps employees find the right specialist within the company on a given issue, such as a particular type of oil drilling problem.The UK oil major is also commended on the touchy-feely front for making it part of a specialist’s job to help a successor, rather than simply getting on with his or her new job. Mr Kay contrasts that approach with the attitude in some parts of the UK civil service, where “people are deemed to be the expert in a field at the instant they step into it”.Mr DeLong cites the in-depth interviews carried out by Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group, on soon-to-retire Concorde engine designers, to ensure their expertise was preserved for future customers – irrespective of Concorde’s own retirement. But getting experts to articulate their knowledge is no simple process, he warns, noting how one US organisation spent $1m on videotaping retiring experts but did not think about how future users would access the information they needed. The tapes now sit on a shelf, unused.IBM has been active in the KM field, too, both on its own account and on behalf of its customers. Internally, its ThinkPlace intranet tool, devised by Nick Donofrio, executive vice-president for innovation and technology, helps the company to marshal and share innovation, and is combined with several cultural and management approaches including incentive and recognition schemes.Then, last September, Big Blue announced new consulting services to help organisations prepare for the potential loss of highly valued skills and knowledge as the baby-boom generation reaches retirement age.Nevertheless, nothing illustrates better the struggles many companies have had with KM than the prevalence of what is euphemistically termed “knowledge recovery”. In plain English, this means bringing back people whose knowledge has been lost, as contractors and consultants.One US study found that 60 per cent of organisations have been doing this, says Mr DeLong, not that companies are too keen to talk about it – “nobody wants to advertise that they’ve made a mistake”, he says. Mr Kay at PA says he is often called in by companies that have lost knowledge or are about to do so, and says this shows they have failed to build KM in to their cultures.Mr Shaffar at Northrop Grumman agrees that “there is not a lot that can be done if someone announces they are retiring in a few months time” and says a long-term strategy is necessary to try to ensure this situation does not arise.For a company such as Northrop Grumman, he says, knowledge resides in practices, and there are groups of employees which represent each practice. “So the question becomes not so much one about individual retirements, but what happens to the practice as a whole as a result of the impact of retirements.”There are some hopeful signs. Mr Murphy at AMR identifies a resurgence of interest in KM as companies recognise the need to get it right, because of the twin pressures of retirements and compliance issues. There is also, he says, a better understanding both of the limitations of the technology, which might account for 10 per cent of a solution, and of the need for companies to take a holistic approach.But, in the face of inexorable demographic trends, there is much more for companies to do on the non-technological side of KM. Succession planning, traditionally limited to very senior posts, needs to be pushed further down the organisation, says Mr DeLong.Northrop Grumman is one company that has stepped up its succession planning activities. The company has been hiring recently, but Mr Shaffar says that, as a result of downsizing in the past, there is a big gap between its baby-boomers and the new “millennials.” This raises questions about where the next generation of leadership will come from.Another idea, recommended by Mr Kay, is a “friendly-leaver” policy for early retirees, ensuring that successors are fully briefed, and advocates creating a culture in which older people feel it is an important part of their job to bring on a new generation. This could be encouraged through financial incentives or simply, in a professional context, by the feeling of enrichment at having helped a younger colleague.Perhaps the biggest challenge, especially for big companies with a long history of downsizing, job cuts and corporate upheaval, is to develop or rebuild the trust that encourages employees to share knowledge rather than hoard it.This has particular resonance in the context of an ageing workforce. At best, companies have a little more time to deal with capturing tacit knowledge if workers stay on longer, says Mr Cheese at Accenture, but the issue will become all the bigger if they do not deal with it, as retirees will depart with even more information in their heads.“The downsizing issue is likely to send a signal to veteran employees that knowledge is the key to them staying in the job,” says Mr DeLong. “How you shift that sentiment and belief, so that older employees share their knowledge, is a real issue for organisations with that history.”But perhaps soon-to-retire employees will take the contrary position, realising that the more they share their knowledge and remain involved with the company’s activities, the more useful they will be seen to be.“People will share with their colleagues if it is presented as helping colleagues with their career and keeping their own legacy alive in the company,” says Mr Shaffar. “As people get closer to retirement, and are presented with an opportunity to be a mentor to a new hire, I think we find they are pretty available.”*Lost knowledge: confronting the threat of an ageing workforce.

423;ACN;Accenture Plc;2006-01-18T13:52:28Z;Lex: IT spending;;The nuclear winter is over, but are Europe’s information technology services stocks still radioactive? Customer budgets are bouncing back after the severe fallout from the late 1990s, growing by 5 per cent last year. As corporate profitability improves, a more pronounced recovery might come as companies finally splurge on projects they have deferred.The evidence is mixed. Surveys of chief technology officers suggest only gradual improvement. On Tuesday, IBM Global Services reported a constant currency sales decline of 1 per cent. Yet Accenture is firing on all cylinders and LogicaCMG on Wednesday confirmed good trading in the UK and the Netherlands. Across the board there is renewed activity in high-margin bespoke IT projects, which had been put on ice.A cyclical recovery seems overdue while the structural bull case – enhancing customer productivity – remains. Still, a structural negative also now exists: low cost competition. Perhaps a fifth of US spending goes offshore, compared to 5 per cent in Europe. The continent’s companies are at least shaking off their complacency, rebasing activity in India, or in the case of Finland’s TietoEnator, in eastern Europe. Capgemini also hopes to buy abroad. Deal activity could work both ways. Facing saturation in the US, India’s IT giants could acquire in Europe.On 17 times 2006 earnings, as estimated by Credit Suisse, the sector is not obviously cheap. But with investor expectations low, and returns on capital still depressed, the prospects for an earnings-led share price recovery look reasonable.
424;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-12-23T19:15:53Z;E&Y poaches Capgemini staff;;Ernst & Young has poached several senior staff from Capgemini, the group to which it offloaded its consulting arm five years ago, as the accountancy firm tries to break back into the market it deserted.All the big four accountants are seeking to expand consulting arms to broaden revenue streams and maintain overall growth.Fee increases from advising companies on regulation are likely to slow next year and the acute conflict-of-interest concerns that led three of the four to sell their consulting businesses are felt to have eased. E&Y moved quickly to start a new consulting operation after the expiration of a non-compete agreement with Capgemini in May this year.The firm has recruited 10 staff from Capgemini, including four partners, and in September hired Steve Varley from Accenture as its new head of advisory services.Mr Varley plans to expand his team of 120 to 300 by the end of next year and was aiming to generate revenue of £75m in 2006. E&Y’s total UK revenue for the year to June was £945m.Bill Cook, commercial director at Capgemini, said competition for consulting staff was intense. “Our attrition rate is not higher than last year but it is higher than we would like.”The big four are reaching the end of a fee bonanza generated this year by audit and advisory work on international accounting standards and the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Growth in their tax businesses is marginal.In 2002 PwC sold its consulting business to IBM and KPMG Consulting was acquired by Atos Origin. The moves came after Enron’s collapse raised serious questions about the independence of audit firms that provided other services to their clients. Deloitte was the only firm to hold onto its consulting arm.The big four today offer a range of consulting services, although they are often loath to label them as such. They advise on strategy, risk management, cost reduction, internal organisation and supply chain management. None of the four are seeking to develop a large business in information technology systems, an important part of the operations that were sold off.In its most recent business year KPMG’s consulting revenue rose 48 per cent to £225m. PwC made £201m from consulting but did not provide a comparative figure for 2004. Deloitte’s consulting revenue was up 6 per cent at £312m. The big four do not publish detailed profit numbers.Mr Varley said E&Y was seeking to bridge a gap in the market between “strategy houses” such as McKinsey and Bain and “IT houses” such as IBM and Accenture. “Strategy houses are sometimes disconnected from how you make change happen, while systems integrators are focused on the technicalities,” he said. “Our clients did not have many places to turn to for practical advice.”Mr Cook said Capgemini was not likely to compete directly with E&Y or lose any major contracts to it. Capgemini was more focused on implementing and maintaining processes and systems, he said.

He was a frontrunner in the race to succeed Anthony Salz as the firm’s UK senior partner – the results of the first round of voting are due today.But a Law Society investigation into the conflict debacle, which began last summer, has still not concluded, leaving O’Brien with little option but to withdraw. He
had maintained he would pull out if the investigation was still hanging over
him, though the firm had hoped it would be concluded by the time the voting began.Perhaps they should have known better. The legal regulator is not renowned for the speed and efficiency of its operations.Congratulations to Sak Nayagam, who works in the oil and gas consultancy arm of Accenture in London. Last month he became the World Muay Thai Organisation Thai boxing champion, winning the Welterweight world title at a fight at York Hall, London’s famous East End boxing ring.Muay Thai is an ancient martial art originating from Thailand, which incorporates the use of fists, feet, knees and elbows as striking weapons.Thanks to a leave of absence from Accenture in 2001, he was able to become a professional fighter, training full-time in Thailand and England. As he developed, fans nicknamed Nayagam “The Slayer” because of his devastating elbow techniques. One opponent was so terrified at the prospect of a bout with Nayagam that he refused to enter the ring.One senior executive and long-time colleague at Accenture was moved to say: “From SAP skills to lethal elbows, he has it all.”Nayagam’s discipline in the ring has also meant that he survived his fight’s relatively unscathed, enabling him to return to work as planned. Although he has now retired from the ring, Nayagam still runs free classes through Accenture’s resources unit. Accenture clients have been warned.Peter Hambro Mining hopes its advisers and investors will dig deep into their pockets for its charity auction tonight in aid of an orphanage in the Amur region on the eastern edge of Russia, near to where the company has a number of exploration sites.Among the more conventional prizes, such as trips to the opera and gold jewellery, are a couple of watercolours by Peter Hambro, the company’s executive chairman. The company has been a keen supporter of the arts in the past, donating the gold to re-gild the picture frames in Catherine the Great’s Chinese Palace outside St Petersburg. However, this is the first time Mr Hambro has made a personal donation of his own handwork.Barclays came slightly unstuck this week in its attempt to spread Christmas spirit by reminding parents just how expensive and destructive their offspring can be.The bank’s insurance arm had sent out a press release, claiming to have new evidence that children were causing thousands of pounds of damage round the home.According to Barclays, this wanton mayhem, such as breaking beds and ruining carpets, was leaving some “harassed” parents wondering if their little angels were deserving of a Christmas present.While all this was leading to a legitimate pitch to check the adequacy of your home insurance, it was spoilt somewhat by an unfortunate typo in the title of the release, which declared: Little angles cause damage in the home.No doubt the thought of harassed Barclay’s PRs having rapidly to send out corrected versions of the press release will be of some consolation to well behaved children across the country.Ogilvy & Mather’s announcement on Wednesday that Rory Sutherland would step up from executive creative director at OgilvyOne to become vice-chairman of Ogilvy was accompanied by an odd company statement.The advertising and communications agency would not be moving to the luvvy heartlands of Soho or Covent Garden, it said, contrary to a report in Campaign, the trade magazine, which claimed the company was looking to leave its offices in Canary Wharf’s Cabot Square.Despite years of jibes from his colleagues in the West End, Gary Leih, chairman, says: “I’ve no idea how we would move out of Canary Wharf or where we would go.”For an outfit that prides itself on thinking outside the box for its clients, doesn’t this show a lack of imagination?mudlark@ft.com"

The risk-reward equation is different to traditional outsourcing: it may have high rewards, but it is also high risk.”These words, from Graham Pascoe, outsourcing expert and partner at PwC’s performance improvement consulting unit, refer to what transformational outsourcing means for clients, but could just as easily be applied to the consultancies themselves – and especially the larger ones that are involved in consulting and outsourcing.There is a big difference between transformational outsourcing and the traditional approach, says Frank Foy, head of UK outsourcing at Capgemini. “Traditionally, we have taken on a piece of work and have run it for a period, often unchanged, for a reduced price,” he says.“Now we are expected to take it on, transform it and offer it at a flexible price going forward. The days of picking up something and not changing it are gone.”David Poole, Capgemini’s vice-president of business process outsourcing (BPO), says this involves taking much greater risk, on behalf of clients, and much more risk sharing. That means sharing in the rewards, too: “There is far more profit opportunity for the providers, and far more benefit upside for clients.” This takes both the consultancy and the client beyond the traditional boundaries of an outsourcing contract.For example, says Mr Poole, if Capgemini has helped a client improve its cash-flow position significantly as a result of transformational outsourcing – perhaps by reducing the cost of its working capital – it would like to share in that benefit. It also recognises, however, that it could lose out if the befits do not emerge.All this obliges the “soup-to-nuts” consultancies and outsourcing providers to broaden the range of skills they have available, and recruit different sorts of people. “Ten years ago, we had one workforce model to be a consultant,” says Stewart Clements, president of Accenture Finance Solutions.“Now we have four different models, with different career paths, motivations and training requirements.”While the traditional consultants are very much focused on projects and their delivery, he says, the priorities for people in the service delivery are different. Here, he says, it is all about continuous improvement and operational excellence. Also, while consultants might move around from project to project and client to client, the service delivery personal could be working with the same client for a long period of time.Before the emergence of BPO, says Mr Clements, the traditional individual partner in a consultancy used to be “renaissance man,” capable of doing everything. “That’s just impossible now, you can’t do that,” he says. He stresses the importance, however, of a “very strong set of shared values” under which the different specialists can work, based around focusing on, and delivering value to, the client. “The values are the same, whether it is in the consulting or outsourcing part of the business,” he says.Collaboration between the two sides of these large consulting/services companies is clearly crucial. In this respect, a key skill identified by Mr Clements is the ability to take project work done by management consultants and “operationalise” it – or to make sure it works on a day-to-day basis.Kevin Campbell, Accenture’s global managing partner for outsourcing, says consulting and outsourcing are different businesses, run differently. “The magic is how you bring these together, with the right skills to get better business outcomes for the client. The key to success is that we have done both, for ever, and we’ve got a lot of people who understand both.”One important side-effect of the growth of BPO for companies such as Accenture, IBM and Capgemini is that it provides work for “traditional” consultants at the front end of each prospective deal. “On the BPO side, virtually everyone I work with was a management consultant in a previous life,” says Mr Poole at Capgemini. “We are finding new channels for their capabilities.” Thus, skills such as change management and expertise in technology architecture are the same as consultants have had in the past, but are being deployed in an outsourcing environment.Mr Clements at Accenture mentions two other implications for consultancies, as they get deeper into outsourcing and running or transforming operations for clients. The first is security, where an extra level of thoroughness is required, involving commitments to training and management.“This is not to say that it doesn’t happen in the [traditional] consulting environment,” he says, “but it is not front line, even though [consultants} may be designing systems that are very important for the clients. It does not have that day-to-day, operational aspect to it.”The second aspect involves the differing investment profile of the consultancy and services sides of the business, says Mr Clements – different facilities and systems are required, with implications for investment in training and methodologies.Domain expertise – knowledge and experience of different industry sectors – has always been important for traditional consulting but outsourcing only increases the role it can play. Detailed knowledge about compliance and regulation may be necessary to win deals, says Mr Poole, and sometimes it has been necessary to recruit people even during the bidding process.In some sectors, special characteristics create opportunities for smaller consultancies to exploit. UK-based Troika, for example has been has been heavily involved in the outsourcing market for financial services over the past few years. Andrew Veal, director, says: “This is not an area where we’re likely to see the big consultancies providing a one-size-fits-all ‘solution’ and, as for the advice, it requires in-depth industry knowledge and expertise to get these complex deals right.”
427;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-11-18T15:30:10Z;Recruitment: Not just another face in the crowd;;For the past four years consultancies have been reticent about hiring new talent, but now that the market is improving recruitment is picking up again. According to the Woodhurst 2005 Annual Salary Survey of consultants, recruitment quotas are up across the industry and the best candidates are considering multiple offers.“The consulting industry is well on the road to recovery, but has yet to wake up to the impending talent shortage,” warns Geraint Evans, managing director of Woodhurst, a specialist recruitment agency for consultancies. “Business advisory firms have been presented with a window of opportunity to secure the best talent at the best value before the market tightens next year, when salary levels should rise. The clock is ticking and the countdown has begun.”Anna Ponton, head of professional services at executive search consultants Odgers Ray & Berndtson, agrees. “There suddenly seems to be a real taste for recruitment again,” she says. “We are still on the upward curve and there are good people in the marketplace, but it will not last long.”With a seller’s market in nearly all areas, potential candidates have a wide choice.Each consultancy is working hard to present itself as attractively as possible to potential recruits. Karen Birch, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association, warns that the talent war makes it necessary for the consultancies to “put all their sweets out on the counter”.Everybody is working on their key messages. BearingPoint and PA Consulting Group emphasise their independence from outsourcing or audit. PA is also emphasising its ability to deliver, rather than just advise.However, Accenture emphasises that its outsourcing business is an advantage when consultants tire of travel.Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu argues that remaining part of an audit company is an advantage. “We have to accept that not providing consultancy services to regulated audit clients is a downside,” admits David Sproul, the firm’s managing partner for talent. “However, the ‘flip’ side is that an increasing proportion of the consultancy work we do involves working with our experts in finance, regulation and taxation, which broadens applicants’ experience and skills.”Accenture also emphasises the quality of its client list, which, along with outsourcing, includes 87 of the Fortune 100 companies. Ernst & Young emphasises its formalised education programme, including an MBA qualification.All this positioning conveniently diverts attention away from money. The Woodhurst survey points out that as there is currently a good supply of acceptable candidates in the majority of sectors, employers are successfully keeping a tight lid on salary inflation, so that salaries and bonuses still remain flat.All the consultancies want to pay the market rate, but do not want to compete on salary or benefits.“We don’t want to go down the model where the only thing we offer is to pay more than anybody else,” says Mr Sproul. Chris Tattersall, head of financial services practice at BearingPoint, points out that whereas employment conditions are a “hygiene factor” – necessary to avoid dissatisfaction, but not providing satisfaction by themselves – they are not a differentiator.Although it is a buyer’s market, clearly not every applicant will be suitable for the demands of consultancy. For instance, BearingPoint is looking for people who can successfully meet three different criteria.They must have real business experience, consulting skills and technology awareness.Although graduate recruitment is booming, most consultancies need to balance education with proven experience.“Our people are our product,” says John Campagnino, Accenture’s director of global recruiting.“We endeavour to find the best people and we leave no stone unturned to find the right talent in the market. There is a finite number of sourcing channels, so success depends on how we leverage them, how deeply we delve into them and the messages we send to applicants through those channels.”Some consultancies are taking a global sourcing approach for applicants. For example, E&Y is recruiting from Turkey and parts of eastern Europe. “They have a huge talent pool to tap into,” says Steve Varley, head of the firm’s advisory services.Similarly, Diagonal Consulting is recruiting graduates from Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. David Beresford, the company’s global managing director explains that they can recruit a higher calibre of graduate at a lower cost.“It is simply too expensive to recruit the quality of graduates we are looking for in western Europe or the US,” he says.“In the short term, they ensure that we can offer clients low-cost technical resource, but we are developing them so that they will become high-level consultants in the future.”Many consultancies are competing for applicants against the large investment banks, who are also trying to recruit from the consultancies. “Consultancies are losing good people to the large investment banks,” says Ms Ponton. “The banks want their experience and the market knowledge they have gained from working for their competitors.”Poaching staff from competitors is to be expected, as it has been a prime source of talent in the past.However, times have changed and the long hours are no longer acceptable as consultants seek a better balance between their work and private lives. Retention of talent is now more important than it has been in the past.“People are no longer seeking partnership and the pursuit of wealth at all costs,” says Ms Birch. “Consulting should be a career for life and there is no need to burn people out or lose them to clients.“Retention is a key issue and both big and small firms are responding. Companies are agreeing to sabbaticals and career breaks because they put an enormous amount into training staff and to lose them after five years can be an incredible waste.”The Woodhurst research found that the three factors that are most likely to cause a job change are money (88 per cent), challenge (87 per cent) and work-life balance (81 per cent), with no other factor exceeding 40 per cent.Furthermore, 84 per cent of respondents would move job to secure more flexible working hours and 74 per cent said they would sacrifice money for a better quality of life.“Today’s high-flyers are increasingly willing to swap financial remuneration for a better work-life balance,” says Mr Evans. “The introduction of flexible or home working patterns can limit the impact on salary bills and secure the loyalty and commitment of a high calibre consultancy team.”
428;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-11-18T15:30:10Z;Innovation: Firms aim for fresh ideas on technology;;The quest for technology innovation may not be happening at quite the same pace and intensity that was seen in the dotcom boom, but for some consultancies it remains an important differentiator in a crowded marketplace.The investment in technology innovation is partly motivated by marketing considerations, but consultancies and experts on the sector are adamant that it goes beyond that.“Investing in technology does have a public relations function for some firms, as a way of promoting specialist knowledge in certain fields,” says Fiona Czerniawska, founder of Arkimeda, which researches the consultancy sector. “But there is a genuine need among clients to have some new ideas, to refresh their own thinking.”Martin Illsley, head of Accenture’s Technology Lab at Sophia Antipolis in southern France, agrees. “Our clients do ask us to deliver on innovation,” he says. “The demand is there.”Accenture has 150 people involved in its Technology Labs, based at the French science park, at Palo Alto in Silicon Valley and in Chicago.Mr Illsley says there are two main reasons why innovation is important to clients. First, he says: “You can only squeeze the lemon so much. Companies have been making so many efforts to cut costs, and increase efficiency, but innovation, through new products, channels or customer markets, is a way to grow your business.”The second attraction of innovation is as a differentiator, says Mr Illsley. “You can’t always do that on price and cost,” he says. “Innovation gives you a way to do this that other companies cannot follow.”The consultancy sector’s clients vary widely in their need for fresh thinking on technology or external assistance to develop new ideas. Some organisations have been so impacted by cost cuts that they have lost the ability to think about innovation, says Alastair McAulay, head of the IT innovation unit at PA Consulting Group. “But there are others where we couldn’t teach them anything.”Mr Illsley says a relatively new trend is for companies that do not have a research and development capability – such as many in the financial services or retail sector – to require “innovation services” from a consultancy such as Accenture. “Many companies need to innovate around services that can be based on emerging technologies,” he says. “They can do this themselves or ask us to help them.”In the future, he says, more companies will want to outsource their innovation capability, and if a consultancy has technological expertise and facilities to match, it can provide practical help. An example is the “bank branch of the future” which Accenture has built at Sophia Antipolis, to show bank executives what new technologies can achieve.The pay-off for consultancies from these initiatives comes from any contracts for strategic, advisory or systems integration work that may follow contact with clients. Similarly, PA’s IT innovation unit produces an annual magazine, 2020, which aims to demonstrate the opportunities that new technology might bring in the near future.“I have seen people reading it on the train, and it gets them interested,” says Mr McAulay. “They learn about the technology and maybe talk to PA about how it applies to their organisation.”But the knowledge flow is not only one-way. Some clients have such an understanding of technology that it may be possible to add their experience to the consultancy’s repository of knowledge, says Mr McAulay.Mr Illsley says a close relationship with clients, in which Accenture’s researchers meet C-level executives on an almost daily basis, can benefit both clients and the consultancy. The researchers get an insight into how a technology can work within a business context, while the clients receive information about innovation from an independent, non vendor-specific, source.As Mr McAulay notes, many companies rely on relationships with vendors. “They need to understand that there is a price attached to that, as vendors do have an agenda. We don’t have any relationships with vendors, and can help clients filter that input.”PA’s London-based IT innovation unit was set up 18 months ago by the UK-based consultancy in an effort to ensure its credentials in this field were more fully recognised by the marketplace, and to inform and inspire its consultants, and thereby clients, about new information technologies and their possibilities.Its much larger counterpart in non-IT technology innovation, based in Cambridge, has for several years illustrated the different directions in which innovative ideas can flow, and results that can be achieved. The same scientists who have developed products to a client’s specification also come up with ideas themselves, says Jon Moynihan, PA’s chairman.As these scientists are business consultants, too, the ideas can range from products to entire business models, he says.Having technological expertise also enables consultants to create their own replicable modules of technology that can be used in different deals, speeding up the implementation process. David Poole, vice-president of business process outsourcing at Capgemini, says this “technological arbitrage” has been important to development of the company’s transformational outsourcing business. Capgemini would not be able to justify investment in the technology if it was used only once.Frank Foy, Capgemini’s head of UK outsourcing, says the ability to bring the company’s experience from one client to another has become more and more a factor in winning deals and then implementing them quickly. “The speed is mind-boggling compared with two to three years ago,” he says.Likhit Wagle, a partner at IBM Global Services’ business consulting services unit, calls this concept “asset-based delivery.” At present consultancy is 95 per cent people-based, he says, but this could eventually fall to 50-55 per cent, with the balance coming from replicable assets such as the technologies emerging from the company’s labs.
429;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-09-07T20:16:21Z;Mudlark: Irish factor for Antipodeans;;Antipodeans who find that their welcome – or at least their two-year working visa – has run out in London may be encouraged to move to Dublin for another year.That’s the bright idea of Brian Hamill, chief executive of Imprint. The fast-growing recruitment group on Wednesday bought Accreate, an Irish agency, for an initial £2m, with a possible earn-out of up to £3.38m in cash and shares.Hamill said Ireland was suffering a huge skills shortage with the ability to fill jobs limited by the mobility of candidates. Itinerant Antipodeans could help to solve the problem.Accreate was founded in 2001 by two former Arthur Andersen accountants. It is not related to Accenture, the Andersen-spawned consulting firm whose name is remarkably similar. Imprint also reported strong profits growth in the first half, when it bought ECHM and Morgan McKinley.Scots’ new castleScottish Newcastle is resisting Edinburgh’s westwards drift of head offices by moving into St Andrew Square, the heart of the Georgian New Town.The decision is a boost for central Edinburgh, with Royal Bank of Scotland having just moved its head offices from the other side of the square to a splendid new £350m campus at Gogarburn, on the western side of the city.Until 1999, S&N was based at Holyrood, a former brewery site now occupied by Scotland’s controversial new parliament. Then it moved to the western suburb of Murrayfield, familiar territory for rugby fans, to premises that were previously the headquarters of Distillers, which was swallowed by Guinness and is now part of Diageo.S&N’s new home was previously occupied by Scottish Equitable, the demutualised life office owned by Aegon, the Dutch insurer that joined the trek west by going to Edinburgh Park. In spite of the august setting, S&N’s guests can be assured: the new office will continue to host a bar with the group’s beers on tap.Square pegsBack before Mudlark was Mudlark, he was a guinea pig, taking the occupational personality questionnaire (OPQ) that is SHL Group’s flagship psychometric test. (FT, March 4 2004).John Bateson, SHL chief executive, took the matter a bit further this week, having taken it on himself to run some person-job matches using that OPQ result and SHL’s universal competency framework to see what alternative careers might suit Mudlark. Does he know something?Of the jobs Bateson chose to illustrate the procedure, flight attendant produced only a 59 per cent match, at the top end of “marginal”, with weakness showing up in “adapting and responding to change”. EasyJet orange doesn’t flatter anyway.Better news came in a “strong match” – 68 per cent – for chief financial officer. Here the excellence of “applying expertise and technology” and “adhering to principles and values” did the trick. An unlikely move, but more like it.Yesterday’s note about Macquarie Bank’s use of psychometric tests stoked the memory of a reader who was hired by the Australian bank in the 1980s. He said: “The tests confirmed I had the necessary aptitudes to be a competent accountant. Luckily I had already decided on accountancy and had qualified as one.”But “unfortunately I did not stay with Macquarie Bank. If I had, I would now be wealthy as a result of the employee share scheme. The psychometric tests I took did not disclose this lack of foresight.”Nothing personalEon’s stalking of Scottish Power has thrown up a piquant peripheral issue. Mudlark understands that Brunswick, the German company’s financial PR adviser, is not exactly sad about the prospect of ending the independence of a client of rival Tulchan, headed by Brunswick old boy Andrew Grant. A takeover battle should be good for fees either way.Watch his spaceCorporate broking is the flavour of the month in London and good targets can demand big bucks. One recent defection brought the lucky three-person team, Mudlark understands, a guaranteed package of £5m at the new employer.The move almost foundered, however, on the team leader’s demand for a car parking space. None was spare, so an existing user was booted out to make room for the new golden boy. Just before he joined, though, the bank learned that he didn’t even have a driving licence.mudlark@ft.com
430;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-09-01T18:11:00Z;Lex: Indian outsourcing;;The software consultancy industry is already one of modern India's success stories, taking advantage of a base of low costs and high skills to serve as the world's back office. Now it is moving into a higher gear. On Thursday, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, two of the biggest, won a slice of a giant deal: ABN Amro's $2.2bn IT outsourcing contract.After previous failures both to win mega-contracts and to partner with global players, this looks like a turning point for the sector. The presence of an international name or two in this case, both IBM and Accenture may help alleviate concerns about data security, sparked by alleged leaks of information at Indian call centres. But the client still gains from moving people and processes to a cheaper market the Dutch bank expects to save €258m a year.This deal is the largest yet won by TCS and Infosys. The contract is spread over five years, however, and works out at around $50m a year for TCS and just under $30m for Infosys hardly life-changing given annual revenues of $2bn each. Instead, the biggest winner is globalisation itself. India's software consultancies are reaching ever further afield: TCS recently signed a Chinese outsourcing joint venture with Microsoft. Meanwhile, more international companies are setting up their own offshore bases in India. IBM already has almost 25,000 staff there. Some of these may well help clear trades from a Dutch broker buying Brazilian shares for a Boston investor.
431;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-08-08T17:24:19Z;E*Trade deal is latest sign of consolidation;;E*Trade Financial on Monday agreed to pay $700m in cash for the Bank of Montreal's Harrisdirect unit, continuing the consolidation among US discount brokers.The acquisition follows E*Trade's failed attempt to acquire rival Ameritrade this year.Bill Cline, head of capital markets at Accenture, said the transaction reflected “the relentless pursuit of scale” among online brokers, which have been pushed to consolidate and trim commissions amid a slowdown in trading.In late June, E*Trade lost the battle to take over Ameritrade, another online broker which chose instead to take over TD Waterhouse, the discount brokerage unit of Canada's Toronto Dominion.If completed, that transaction would have made E*Trade the largest discount broker in the US. Monday's deal leaves E*trade in third place behind Charles Schwab and Ameritrade.However, Mr Cline said that there was “still plenty of consolidation to be had in the industry, and many different ways to pursue scale”.Mitchell Caplan, E*Trade's chief executive officer, said the broker would “continue to actively pursue opportunities” that enabled it to further build on its “distinct business model”.The transaction brings 4m customer accounts, about $130bn in assets and about $24bn in cash and deposits to E*Trade .E*Trade estimated that yesterday's deal would generate a total of $186m in savings, of which $72m would be additional revenue and $114m cost cuts. Mr Caplan said E*Trade would cut costs at Harrisdirect by about 71 per cent.Mr Cline said consolidation enabled discount brokers to sell a wider range of services to a larger number of clients at lower costs.Investors appeared to applaud Monday's transactions, bidding E*Trade's stock up more than 10 per cent to $16.35 by midday. Shares in the Bank of Montreal eased 0.2 per cent to C$59.08 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.Heightened speculation about a possible takeover bid for Charles Schwab sent its shares sharply higher in early July, and led the company's founder to issue a statement denying the brokerage was for sale.Accenture's Mr Cline said there were “different ways to skin the cat” and saw the move as evidence of Schwab's decision to pursue different ways to grow.
432;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-07-19T16:03:45Z;NTT Data in link with French group;;NTT Data, Japan's largest independent IT systems integrator, and Capgemini have agreed to work together as preferred partners in the US, Europe and Japan.The planned global alliance highlights the pressures facing the sector as well as the difficulty western companies have in penetrating the Japanese market for IT services.Under the agreement, NTT Data will also acquire 95 per cent of the shares of Capgemini's Japanese subsidiary for an undisclosed sum. The French group, which had sales of Y3.1bn ($27.5m) in Japan last year and employs 150 people, will retain a seat on the board.The deal is expected to help NTT Data expand its presence among foreign companies building IT systems in Japan and to help Capgemini win contracts with NTT Data's clients in the west.However, the alliance is not exclusive and does not preclude either group from working with other partners.The deal underscores the pressures on IT services groups as weak economic activity and fierce global competition have taken their toll.Capgemini, Europe's largest IT services group, has faced a particularly difficult period and is cutting 1,500 jobs on top of 8,000 shed since 2001.In January, its credit rating was lowered to junk status by Standard & Poor's.Earlier this year, Capgemini sold its North American health practice to Accenture for $175m as part of an asset disposal programme aimed at reversing three years of losses.The sale of its Japanese unit, which is in line with that programme, comes as competition in Japan has intensified amid a lack of major projects.“During the first IT boom, companies shifted people to the software business, and the Year 2000 problem followed by Japan's bank mergers triggered huge demand for IT services. But there are no longer projects of that scale, so competition has become fierce,” says Yoshiharu Izumi, electronics analyst at JPMorgan in Tokyo.NTT Data, which is 54 per cent owned by NTT, the telecoms group, has reported falls in operating profits for the past two years, from Y61.5bn in the year ended March 2003 to Y39.2bn in March 2005.It forecasts a recovery in operating profits to Y45bn this year on sales of Y880bn.But even before the slowdown, foreign companies struggled to win business in Japan in competition with the dominant players, which are hardware manufacturers including Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC.“Japan is the only country where IBM is not dominant [in IT services],” says Mr Izumi.
433;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-07-18T16:34:57Z;Accenture warns about risks of IT false economies;;The quest to contain corporate spending on information technology frequently backfires as companies make false economies that only increase maintenance and repair costs, according to a report on Monday from Accenture.The global consultancy and technology services provider said many companies and governments were falling into an “austerity trap” in which they believed they could freeze, or even cut, IT budgets while maintaining the same level of service.Since the end of the dotcom boom, pressure has grown on chief information officers (CIOs) to “do more with less” as companies have sought to rein in their IT spending.In many cases boards have clamped down on IT spending because of dissatisfaction about the results, as investments failed to deliver on their promise.The Accenture study, based on a survey of CIOs from 300 big companies and organisations worldwide, suggests there is a wide difference in how CIOs and their companies have fared in this changed environment.It highlights significant differences between what Accenture calls high, average and low-performing IT organisations, based on 33 proprietary indicators for managing IT.High-performing organisations spent significantly less time maintaining and fixing systems, and significantly more time building new systems.In contrast, said Accenture, average and low performers fell into an austerity trap in which underinvesting to reduce costs in the short term increases the percentage of time required to maintain and fix “legacy” or older, existing systems in the long term.This was because older systems cost more to maintain and require more effort to integrate with newer systems.“Poor spending quality is characterised by a high percent of time spent on maintaining and fixing systems versus investing in productivity-driving change,” said Bob Suh, Accenture's chief technology strategist, who headed the study.The study found that the average IT organisation spends about 12 per cent of its time fixing preventable problems. High performers spend only 5 per cent of their time on these tasks, while low performers devoted 16 per cent.“More than half of government respondents told us they're spending too much on fixing their existing applications, and too little time on building new ones,” said Marty Cole, groupchief executive at Accenture's government operating group.“They want to do more. But they're being given about 30 per cent more work with only about 5 to 10 per cent more budget. Consequently, innovation is being curbed and productivity is being undermined.”
434;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-07-14T07:06:24Z;Philips sells remaining Atos Origin stake;;Philips, the Dutch electronics and healthcare group, has sold its remaining holding in Atos Origin, the French IT services group, for €550m ($664m).The sale of 10.3m shares will result in a non-taxable gain of €190m in the third quarter, Philips said.The Dutch group bought a 31.9 per cent stake in Atos Origin in 2000, but sold just over half of that in December.The second sale disposes of Philips’ 15.4 per cent stake in the group, which competes for big IT outsourcing contracts with other services companies such as EDS and Accenture. Philips is one of its customers.Philips also last year sold its stakes in Vivendi Universal, the French-American media group, and in ASML, Dutch computer chip equipment maker, as part of a plan to reduce its exposure to cyclical technology and electronics markets and increase its revenue from medical equipment and healthcare systems.In its first quarter results, Philips had €3.21bn in cash on its balance sheet.Citigroup managed the share placement.Philips shares rose 1.4 per cent to €22.67 in early morning trade.
435;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-07-13T08:17:35Z;Glover Ferguson of Accenture;;The appliance of science to businessAccenture, the world’s largest consultancy, walks the walk and talks the talk. It makes things. For example, it used radio frequency identification (RFID) to invent a talking medicine cabinet which warns you if you take out the wrong medication. It used the same technology to create a talking gas cylinder which can recite its life history and make it less likely the cylinder will be filled with the wrong gas or delivered to the wrong customer.These were developed in Accenture’s research facilities, laboratories where the emphasis is on harnessing tried and tested technologies to new applications rather than basic science. “Fundamental research to us is just demonstrating new capability,” says Glover Ferguson, Accenture’s chief scientist. His is a comparatively new position, created in November 2000 by the consultancy’s then chief executive, Joe Forehand. The idea was to bring together for the first time the company’s disparate research and development groups: “It’s so much better now,” Mr Ferguson says emphatically.But what does chief scientist mean at a company like Accenture which makes its money devising and advising on corporate strategies? It has laboratories in Chicago, Palo Alto and France staffed by some 150 scientists and engineers but it doesn’t pursue research for its own sake. “We are an applied laboratory,” the energetic Mr Ferguson muses. “We don’t invent the technology. We try to invent the applications.”It recruits the best researchers from around the world - “people who have published, who can hold their own in academic conferences,” Mr Ferguson says, but who want to tackle real life problems.“It takes us forever to hire a researcher. We can’t have somebody who has the academic technique of applying assumptions to a problem until it’s small enough to swat. Our clients can’t do that with their businesses.”Mr Ferguson has been at Accenture - it was Andersen Consulting then - since graduating with a master’s degree in industrial engineering from Stanford University in 1974 and in the Chicago laboratories since 1976. Among other accomplishments, he has been a specialist in CICS, IBM’s legendary transaction processing monitor developed at the computer giant’s Hursley, UK, research centre.He was also the guiding spirit behind the company’s own Foundation computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tool programme in the 1980s. At the time, he thought case would be the future of programming. These days he is happy to concede he was wrong.Today, however as he edges towards retirement later this year, his role is two-fold: internally he is the labs’ technology talent spotter: externally, the evangelist for his laboratories.“The role of the labs and my role is interpreting weak signals. You see something in the market: perhaps it’s a one off-and you wonder: ‘Is that going to turn into something serious and what would that imply?’ So interpreting those weak signals and finding the patterns and connections to be able to focus our research in the correct direction is my internal role.” Externally, it’s explaining what we have found and what we see in terms that a business person can relate to.”“We maintain a running five year vision as to what we think is going to happen in the economy, so everything that happens every day is either a test of that, augmenting it or changing its direction a little bit - it would be nice to think it’s done by committee but its more like a gestalt room with lots of yelling back and forth. When we find something we agree on, we try to find the best way to articulate that vision.”How does Mr Ferguson communicate his own vision to his team? “Metaphor, story telling, whatever gets the message across,” he says. “I use pictures rather than words and Powerpoint presentations. I want an image to stick in someone’s mind.”Every head of a laboratory has the problem of keeping him or herself up to speed with what’s happening at bench level: “Some of it is just management by walking around. And in the earliest stages of research, there are some things I don’t want to know about. As an engineer, I would probably press the kill button way too soon. So I try not to look at developments in their earliest stages, but when a researcher thinks they have a business proposal I look at it. And if I think it’s stupid I keep quiet and come back in a couple of weeks when it might look different.”An example of the kind of development emerging from the Accenture labs is an infinitely scalable touch screen the size of an office wall. More than one person can touch the screen at any time opening new possibilities for interactivity. Mr Ferguson accepts that at first sight the screen is simply “eye candy”, but the actual research is concerned with how people might use it as a genuine business tool.Mr Ferguson says: “We figured out that we had invented a new medium for advertising. What if your store window was a interactive wall. It becomes a very interesting way to get your message across and to engage the consumer. If you have these screens in a whole chain of stores you can change the advertising messages overnight.”The big business problem today, he thinks, is “refiring the boilers of innovation” after several years of tight budgets and retrenchment: “Our clients weren’t interested in the future, they were interested in surviving until tomorrow. Now they are worried that they haven’t been innovative enough and that their own innovation processes are broken. We can bring ideas to bear that are not even in their peripheral vision.”He points out that once infrastructure is in place - a local area network, for example - the marginal cost of new and innovative applications is close to nothing. So Accenture is working hard on those applications.
436;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
437;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-07-08T11:40:10Z;The week in technology: No progress on patents;;Patent proposals droppedAfter three years of wrangling, the EU failed to reach agreement on a common approach to software patents when a draft bill was voted down by a massive majority.By the time they were voted on the proposed laws had few supporters. Big technology companies said the numerous amendments to the bill meant it would be confusing and could endanger jobs. Smaller companies feared that it would mean a more liberal patent regime that would be unfavourable businesses which cannot afford expensive court action to defend their intellectual property rights or challenge patents which they believe breach their own copyright. This, they argued, would in fact stifle innovation.The European Commission however warned that 25 different and competing patent regimes across the EU could also hurt the competitiveness of companies in the region.The question of what happens next has brought just as much disagreement - some MEPs want a new proposal, while others think the entire matter should be ended.Asian expansionAccenture, the management outsourcing and consultancy company, said it plans to hire up to 30,000 new staff in China, India and the Philippines over the next three years. The group is continuing to increase the amount of development work done offshore.Intel gets starstruckIntel is teaming up with Hollywood star Morgan Freeman to distribute movies to consumers directly over the web in a bid to battle piracy.The world’s leading chipmaker said it would invest an undisclosed sum in the actor’s start-up ClickStar, expected to launch in early 2006.ClickStar aims to release movies over the internet before they are officially available on DVD and potentially as they are still doing the rounds at cinemas.Currently, the major studios have a tried and tested release sequence for movies - from box office to DVD and television rights.But since the digitalisation of movies, piracy has soared putting pressure on Hollywood to adapt their distribution methods to the digital age.No studios have signed up for ClickStar yet but the combination of Intel’s clout and Mr Freeman’s fame is sure to turn a few heads in Tinseltown.“Our aim is to deliver first-run premium entertainment to film fans around the world and to make film easier to buy than to pirate,” said Mr Morgan at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in Idaho.Mr Morgan will have to overcome movie executive concerns that tinkering with the release system will reduce revenues and upset cinemas and DVD retailers. Initially, ClickStar will focus on independent films.Intel’s involvement is part of its strategy to boost microprocessor sales by promoting the PC as a home entertainment hub.Terror hits mobile phonesMobile phone operators said their networks experienced severe congestion following the bomb attacks in London, but claimed they held up well under the strain of stranded commuters attempting to call loved ones and work colleagues.“Our network is performing normally. People may be experiencing difficulties on the first attempt but we advise them to try again and expect them to get through on the second or third attempt,” said Stewart Jackson, a spokesman from Orange, as the news of the terror attacks broke.Both Vodafone and O2 described their networks as undamaged but very congested, adding that this was the only reason callers were having trouble making contact.They concurred with Orange that in emergencies people should keep trying but requested that customers in Central London “avoid making unnecessary or lengthy phone calls”.Operators denied rumours that they had been ordered to shut down networks by the governments because of fears mobile phones might be being used to detonate explosions.“The first thing we do in these situations is to contact the Home Office and and offer our help, but the government hasn’t requested it,” said Mr Jackson.However, Vodafone said it worked closely with the emergency services to provide them with priority coverage.Fixed-line networks appeared to be unaffected by the blasts.

439;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-05-10T11:03:27Z;Sensing a technological shift;;"Some day in the not too distant future, a package in the back of a lorry will report back to base the instant the ambient temperature rises. Vineyards will constantly track environmental conditions in real time around each vine, and use this information for decisions on watering and applying fertiliser. And in the remotest wilds of Scotland, minute embedded sensors will alert scientists hundreds of miles away about the encroachment of pollutants into vital habitats supporting rare species.Such examples reflect the popular image of what Accenture calls Sensor Telemetry. Sophisticated? Yes. Complex? Possibly. Futuristic? Not any longer. Two of the three applications outlined above are already happening. And technology that could be used to implement the third - the monitoring of pollution in remote areas where humans rarely venture - has been developed, and is ready to go.All these developments represent real steps forward towards the vision of ‘Reality Online’ - a world where objects can sense, reason, communicate and act remotely in real time. This vision will be delivered on the ground by the ‘sensor revolution’ which is now gathering pace. We are already seeing companies developing remote monitoring prototypes for applications in areas including transportation, manufacturing, energy, medical equipment, agriculture and environmental protection.Through the smokescreenSo the senor-driven future is getting nearer all the time. And, far from being a sudden breakthrough, sensor telemetry represents an incremental and utterly logical extension to other tried and tested technologies. However, its potential applications are no less exciting - and will become no less ubiquitous - for that.What sensor telemetry does is to unite sensor, communication and data management technologies, allowing them to gather, transmit and interpret information about the attributes of a physical object or location. These capabilities are then combined with context-relevant processing at one or both ends of a wireless network to turn the resulting data into meaningful, insightful intelligence, delivered remotely and in real time.Sensor telemetry shares some common ground with the mobile commerce applications that are delivered over wireless networks, and that use a browser to enable the device to interact with a back-end system. Where sensor telemetry differs is in having a two-way, machine-to-machine communication path, which in turn means that the device is in some way registered with, and recognised by, the back-end system.Telematics, which has been around for years in the automotive sector, is an example of sensor telemetry between vehicles on the move, and service providers. Detailed information from the car’s location, electronic systems and engine sensors is sent in real time to back-end systems. In the case of roadside assistance service providers, this data is used to speed up the call-out, and to give the patrol the insight needed to be better prepared to handle the problem at the roadside.In addition to telematics applications, sensor telemetry may be used in conjunction with radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. This is where a more sophisticated remote sensor platform - or ‘mote’ - builds on RFID’s notion of ‘identity’ by adding context-relevant sense information.Sensor motes are much more autonomous than RFID tags, and do not need proximity to a reader to communicate. Consider, for example, a prototype from Accenture Technology Labs called “Cargo Monitoring,” which is aimed at addressing the threat posed by the millions of shipping containers that pass unchecked through the world’s ports each year.The “Cargo Monitoring” prototype exploits the idea that sensors on a container may sense threats beyond the individual container upon which they’re mounted. A threat detected by a “smart container” - containers fitted with radiation-sniffing sensors - is communicated back to a security application through a mesh network. This application, in turn, associates the threat with all containers in the smart container’s immediate vicinity.As the threatened container makes its way to its destination, the process is repeated as it is observed by multiple smart containers and the identity of the threatened container is narrowed down, whether in a “smart” or “dumb” (no sensors) container. The container is flagged for action, be it inspection or other measures. Using this approach a small percentage of “smart” containers can provide incremental levels of security for their “dumb” container counterparts for a much lower cost than instrumenting all containers.A focus on functionSo identification and tracking are only the start. Where sensor telemetry really starts to make sense is by allowing people elsewhere to gain real-time access to information about an object’s precise state and environment - weight, temperature, surrounding air quality, exposure to light, noise or vibrations, in fact anything measurable by a sensor - and then enabling that information to be communicated, interpreted and acted upon.The resulting applications go far beyond the business world. A sensor can be trained to distinguish a gunshot from other sounds and installed in a protected forest area frequented by poachers or in a city centre. Cellular cultures can be built into a sensor and monitored for their rate of growth and decay, yielding valuable insights about changes in the local environment. Similar sensors might be combined to track the likelihood of a forest fire breaking out in a specific remote area, giving the forestry and emergency services vital time in which to pre-empt a possible disaster.The business applications are equally transformational for the industries involved. Benefits include better visibility over the condition of goods in transit, higher safety standards and better use of assets - for example by letting goods suppliers know when a container has been emptied. The key in each case is that sensor telemetry delivers actionable insight about the unique circumstances in a remote location.Set for take-offAs the possibilities of these capabilities come increasingly into focus, four factors are converging to make sensor telemetry ready for widespread adoption. The first is cost. Sensor and wireless technologies are now cheaper than ever. With expanded connectivity and the increasing ubiquity of wireless networks, getting data remotely or on the move is increasingly easy and inexpensive. The second factor is the advent of cheaper and smaller ‘smart sensor’ platforms including technologies such as motes and Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS). Thirdly, the rising penetration of RFID has meant that industry has begun to understand the potential of tracking to drive business benefits, and that opportunities exist for improving the levels of visibility further through a natural progression into applications using even smarter sensors and sensor telemetry.The fourth factor is the increasing need for the type of insights sensor telemetry can deliver. In a business context, customers continue to demand faster, better, cheaper products and services in all industries. In society at large, there is growing need for preventative and cost-effective intervention in areas ranging from environmental protection to the health of the growing elderly population. Sensor Telemetry offers a means to increase focus on service and quality in all these areas, turn products into services, and respond immediately to the needs of people ranging from customers to patients.All the elements to enable sensor telemetry are in place. Intelligent smart sensors, processing and networking capabilities on integrated platforms; wireless networks suited to different applications; and the processing power needed to turn data into intelligent, relevant insight. All these technologies are advancing fast. For example, ‘Smart Dust’ - being developed at the University of California at Berkeley - will pack a sensor, power supply, analogue circuitry, radio communication capability and a programmable microprocessor all into a package the size of a pinpoint. The current prototype carries processing and communications but as yet no integrated power unit, and measures just 2.5mm by 2.5mm.The message is clear: sensor telemetry is coming soon to an application near you. Now is the time to start thinking about what it can do for your business.By Joel Osman, Associate Partner, Accenture Technology Labs.

440;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-04-27T19:31:32Z;A new wave on the horizon;;"It all sounded rather clubby. On September 1 2004, Accenture UK, the country's biggest consulting and outsourcing firm, announced that its boss, Ian Watmore, was to become the British government's new head of e-government. The head of Accenture's public sector practice, Lis Astall, was to replace him. What better confirmation could there be that the private sector was tiring of the consultants' special brand of thin air? Management consulting's future was said to lie in the public sector, as close as possible to the new Labour managerial establishment.Now it looks as if the theory must be revised. Ms Astall, a 20-year Accenture veteran, notes that while 2004 was a bumper year for government contracts, they still only account for ""between 10 and 15 per cent"" of Accenture's business in the UK. The most important sector for her consultants is financial services, exemplified by such big projects as a £400m10-year outsourcing and information technology deal with Barclays Bank.Accenture, she says, has resisted becoming dependent on the fortunes of any one service or sector, preferring a presence in multiple industries.""There are waves to these things,"" she says. ""Government certainly accounted for a lot of the recent growth, with a run of contracts being agreed, and the hunt for cost savings attached to the efficiency review process [the Gershon review]. But it can take two years to negotiate a contract, so I expect government will go quiet for a bit and the battle for new business models and value creation in the private sector will take up the slack.""In 2004, Accenture grew by 19 per cent, taking revenues to £1.2bn and outpacing the company's overall global performance of 16 per cent growth.Unlike many consultancies, Accenture even managed to keep hiring during the downturn of 2001-2002.According to analysts Ovum, this success is built on more than simply a broad-based portfolio: the ability to sell ""transformational outsourcing"" - the bundling of big information technology assignments with outsourcing and consulting. Yet Ms Astall resists picking out any single theme as being responsible for recent performance.Instead, she argues that demand for consultancy varies heavily between marketplaces. In banking, clients want advice on innovative ways to grow and sell in saturated, heavily regulated markets. In utilities and insurance, techniques of responding to customer behaviour, such as customer relationship management and ""propensity modelling"", remain a prime selling point. In retail, it is supply chains.Only in the popularity of business process outsourcing - where companies hand over transactional processes to third party specialists - does Ms Astall see a client trend. Out of Accenture's 10,500 UK staff, 500 work on outsourcing alone. Ovum credits the $575m (£302m) human resources outsourcing deal Accenture signed with BT in February as a sign of the buoyancy of the outsourcing market.""The assignments we are facing as consultants are no longer just about cutting costs,"" says Ms Astall.""If it were straightforward, clients would do it for themselves. The projects are tending to be much more sophisticated and complicated, involving many different components of which one is frequently outsourcing and offshoring. But I just don't think you can say the growth is down to any one thing.""While some observers say white collar process work will increasingly be outsourced, Ms Astall does not believe the move is necessarily permanent.""Some of it will of course go offshore -Brazil, Russia, India and China are all placing themselves to receive this kind of work. But companies are experimenting with what business will work offshore and stay there and what will have to come back.""Recent months have not been quite so kind to Accenture. It has had its pride, and possibly its revenues, hurt by some public criticism from a client in the form of J Sainsbury. Justin King, who took over as chief executive of the supermarket group last year, appeared to blame Accenture for the poor performance of a new stock tracking and logistics system.And earlier this month, profit margins announced in the US dipped on news of problems on its NHS IT modernisation project.Cost overruns and deployment delays mean that losses of up to $150m will be incurred on the contract this year. Ms Astall remains quiet on such matters. Yet even on the day the NHS setbacks were announced, Accenture UK still managed to show some good results: second quarter revenues were again up by 22 per cent on a year ago."
441;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-04-20T07:12:41Z;Not really a retail revolution, yet;;“Probably not in our working lifetime,” executives were saying at a meeting of European retailers last month. They were discussing the prospects for radio frequency identification (RFID) and questioning whether the technology could live up to the hype that has engulfed it.The story of RFID in retail is a familiar one to seasoned observers of the technology industry who have seen dozens of “transform-business-as-we-know-it” technologies either sink without trace or deliver on their promise years, and billions of dollars, later than predicted.Unfortunately for many companies, particularly their chief information officers, hype can take on a life of its own and the pressure to employ a new technology can build very quickly.Nowhere is this more true than in the retail industry where initial reports about Wal-Mart’s RFID mandate made much more of this fledgling technology than it deserved. Ever since, pressure has grown on rivals to show they are as innovative as their American rival.Take Carrefour, for example. The French retailer has plenty of other priorities without concerning itself with an unproved technology. Yet Carrefour is expected to make a commitment to RFID this year so that it is not perceived as a “laggard”.Lyle Ginsburg, a consultant at Accenture, says the jury is still out on RFID. Although RFID is being put to use in some corners of the real world, many assumptions have been made about the significance of the trials that retailers have been running, he says.Most are closed-loop implementations of limited scope - that is RFID tags are placed on a small number of pallets and cases that are shipped between a retailer’s own depots and stores.Wal-Mart caused the initial commotion about RFID when it mandated suppliers to tag pallets of goods shipped to its stores and is supposed to be leading the way. In a sense, it is. But its RFID project is operating on a relatively small scale.RFID at Wal-Mart involves a little more than 100 out of 68,000 suppliers. The company declines to say how many stock keeping units are sent to Wal-Mart depots with RFID tags, but it is estimated to be a fraction of the 116,000 product lines it sells in a typical store.The idea, touted in 2003, that Wal-Mart’s other suppliers would be asked to tag all their goods remains controversial. US manufacturers and suppliers are sceptical of RFID because they see no benefit in using it, other than keeping their largest customer happy.In the UK, Tesco is satisfying itself with a limited closed loop implementation of RFID, having previously announced grander intentions. The problem has not only been technological limitations and legislative barriers, but that most suppliers do not want to play ball.In Germany, Metro claims to have shaved some time off deliveries made to its depots by 20 of its 1,000 suppliers using RFID. On-shelf availability of its goods has improved as well.Although this is progress and a demonstration of RFID’s benefits, it remains a small number of suppliers. Elsewhere most retailers have other priorities.ECR Europe, a retail trade organisation that concerns itself with supply chain efficiency, found in a recent survey that only 9 per cent of large European retailers were evaluating RFID. Although with giants such as Tesco, Metro and Carrefour testing the waters RFID is gaining some momentum, it is not yet the retail revolution we have been told to expect.That is partly because existing business processes have to be ship-shape before retailers even think about investing in RFID.Then there is the disparate array of data and business systems that operate behind the scenes of a typical retailer. Adding RFID to often complicated situations would be like trying to fix a city’s traffic congestion by giving every commuter a faster car.The large retailers are investing in RFID because they are in a better position to use the technology. While their moves may encourage other retailers to follow suit, many may decide to wait or seek alternative ways to oil their supply chains.Tesco set an example last year when it cut £30m from inventory losses in the UK by following an ECR model for improving processes. That is 15 times more than it has been reported as saying it can save using RFID.The saving came from a reduction in shrinkage - inventory lost in the supply chain, either through incompetence or theft. This, along with on-shelf-availability, is the source of retail interest in RFID.In one ECR-guided operation outside the UK, Gillette cut shrinkage in a Tesco store by 70 per cent. Sales increased 200 per cent from an improvement in on-shelf availability.It is through schemes such as this that ECR is making small dents in the €30bn that is lost to shrinkage in the European retailing industry every year.The latest word on Tesco’s ECR programme is that it has made £100m of savings. This figure is unconfirmed, but if accurate it does prove that managers with clipboards can have a positive influence on the supply chain without radio tags.It would also convince most retailers that for the time being they can sit back and watch the RFID trailblazers in action before taking difficult and expensive decisions of their own.
442;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-04-13T22:19:24Z;Siebel ousts chief executive after sales fall;;Siebel Systems, a fallen star of the software industry, on Wednesday replaced its chief executive for the second time in less than a year as it continues to suffer falling sales and pressure from unhappy shareholders.The company named George Shaheen, a technology industry veteran, to succeed Mike Lawrie, the former IBM executive appointed in May last year.Mr Lawrie himself took over from Tom Siebel, who created one of the most successful software companies of the 1990s, riding on the boom as big companies bought packaged software to automate many of their operations.As chairman and Siebel's biggest shareholder, with 11 per cent of the stock, Mr Siebel played a part in Mr Lawrie's departure. “The board and Mike spoke and agreed he would step down as CEO,” Mr Siebel said. “This is all about performance.”Last week the company revealed sales of new software licences in the first quarter of this year were lower than at any time since 1998. The leader in customer relationship management software, which companies use to run call-centres and automate their salesforce operations, Siebel has suffered from a slump in big new call-centre and other projects, as well as competition from companies such as Salesforce.com, which have developed a new business by selling salesforce support as a service over the internet.Mr Shaheen, 60, made his name as head of the former Andersen Consulting, since renamed Accenture, which increased its revenues from $1bn to $9bn during the decade he was in charge. However, as head of Webvan, an internet grocery company, he went on to preside over one of the biggest flops of the dotcom era.Siebel's shares have risen since its profit warning last week. This, said Yun Kim, software analyst at AG Edwards, reflected a belief on Wall Street that the company might be put up for sale or bow to pressure and pay out some of its $2.2bn cash hoard to shareholders. Oracle, the most acquisitive software company, has included Siebel in the past on a list of companies it wants to buy.Mr Siebel and Mr Shaheen moved quickly to fend off suggestions that Siebel might be sold. “I want to emphasise this is not an interim leadership position,” Mr Siebel said of Mr Shaheen. “I am here to continue to build this company that is a long-term goal as I see it,” said Mr Shaheen.
443;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-04-07T22:54:47Z;Accenture sales increase by 15%;;Accenture, the consulting and outsourcing company, reported a 15 per cent increase in second-quarter sales, boosted by a weak dollar and a strong performance by its financial services group.But problems with a major IT contract with the UK's National Health Service hit gross margins, which fell from 33 per cent to 30.8 per cent year-on-year.Net sales were $3.8bn, up from $3.3bn in the second quarter of 2004. Earnings per share rose 59 per cent to 35 cents.The rise in revenues was only 10 per cent in localcurrency because of the weak dollar.Bill Green, chief executive, said: ?We could not be more pleased with our strong top- and bottom-line performance. I feel good about thebusiness. Activity level is higher than it has been in years.?Mr Green pointed to the strength of the traditional consulting business, amounting to 60 per cent of total revenues and up 8 per cent in local currency compared with a year ago.Companies were asking for ?transformational? advice, he said. ?People are reinventing their businesses, they have more confidence in the economy and are doing things they had put off before.?The most active sector was financial services, where sales rose 25 per cent in local currency to $859m.But Mike McGrath, chief financial officer, said the scale of problems with its NHS government contract had now reached a magnitude where they had to be revealed to the market.There had been delays in deployment of a new assessment care system, he said, and talks were now taking place with the NHS on different deployment plans.Losses of $110m to $150m were expected on the contract in the current fiscal year and losses would continue at a lesser level in 2006.The contract was expected to turn the corner and start to become profitable in 2007, he said.Accenture's earnings were ahead of market expectations of 32 cents a share.

444;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-04-06T07:53:11Z;Europe’s companies suffer dwindling fortunes;;If the West Coast of the US is the fertile soil in which software companies have sown their seed then, Europe, it seems, is the stony ground that is becoming ever rockier.Measuring software companies can be a tricky business as the revenues of many include contributions from services divisions and other units that have little to do with software. Most indexes also fail to take into account the activities of groups such as IBM and Accenture which also have significant software elements, but whichever way the industry is indexed or measured the results make poor reading from a European perspective.Of the 300 or so software companies around the world with annual revenues of more than $40m, only about 30 or so are based in Europe and only two European software companies - SAP and Misys - make it into the top 10 largest software companies.SAP, the only European group with a scale to match that of the US giants, is ahead of the others by a long margin and with 2004 revenues of $9.7bn accounts for as much income as the next 10 continental groups combined.What is worse, the situation seems to be deteriorating rather than improving. In 2002 there were still 40 software companies in Europe with revenues of more than $40m, but over the past two years, industry consolidation has taken its toll on numbers.European companies are continuing to be snapped up by larger US rivals. According to a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report, around 48 per cent of last year’s acquisitions were bought by US groups - and in 70 per cent of these acquisitions the target was European.Software companies that have disappeared from the market through this route in the past year include Staffware, Merant, London Bridge, Eyretel, Sherwood International, Suse Linux, and Ixos.“It’s not normal that we are where we are today - with just 30 big software companies in Europe,” says Bernard Liautaud, chief executive of Business Objects, the French group which, with annual revenues of $561m, is one of Europe’s five largest software companies.But explaining why big software businesses are failing to grow in Europe is complex. Adam Hale, head of European Technology at Russell Reynolds, the recruitment company, and author of a recently released report “The Demise of the European Software Industry”, believes the reasons are partly structural - to do with the nature of the European market and investor behaviour - but also in part to do with culture.An often-cited reason is the fragmented nature of the European market. Whereas US companies have access to nearly 300m customers in a unified home market, most speaking the same language, Europe is divided into 45 small markets, most with their own languages - and their own local competitors.Whereas a specialist software company might have only three or four competitors in the whole of the US, they might have three or four competitors in each European country.The biggest European software companies tend to be ones that have made the US a large part of their business - usually at a relatively early stage of their development. Misys, for example, has a booming business in the US healthcare industry and gets nearly 38 per cent of revenues from the region, while more than 40 per cent of Business Objects’ revenue is from the US.“We set up in the US very early on. We wanted to compete with US rivals straight away,” says Mr Liautaud. “I would advise companies not to wait until they are five, six or seven years old, they should start their US business earlier.”But while Mr Liautaud emphasises the importance of the US market, he warns European companies not to use their fragmented home market as an excuse for not doing well. In fact, Mr Liautaud believes the feature could in fact be a hidden advantage.“Tough conditions make you stronger,” he says. “Brazilians are better at soccer because they play barefoot on the beach. In the same way, Europe could become better at building international companies - we have had more practice at doing it.”Another factor holding back European software companies is investor behaviour. Mr Hale says that, in contrast to “big and seldom” funding approach of the US, European investors tend to fund “little and often”, giving companies a more short-termist approach.Drip-feeding European companies capital over several rounds of funding can force them into generating revenue early through consulting or customised projects, says Mr Hale. Though the revenue comes in, these early projects can often turn into a drain on resources, leaving the company with multiple legacy versions of software to support and taking management focus away from a big, global launch.Exacerbating the structural issues of fragmentation and equity markets, adds Mr Hale, is a lack of management talent.Each of the top 50 software companies in Europe has a first-time chief executive, he points out. While this includes individuals like Henning Kagermann of SAP, whose stewardship of the German giant is widely regarded as successful there are many others who have been unable to make the leap into a new role as successfully.Part of the reason for the shortage in experienced executives, Mr Hale says, is down to a difference in attitude and personal motivation in the US and Europe.“In the US a partially successful CEO may want to repeat the experience, ‘and do it better’. This does not just relate to money, it also relates to personal ambition and peer pressure,” he says.“In Europe, a different mentality seems to exist. Individuals aim to make themselves and their families financially comfortable, typically a target of around $5m. In many cases successful CEOs are not willing to take on the effort, strain and risk of doing it again, aiming to realise enough wealth ‘so I don’t have to be a CEO again’.”The shortage has left a number of European companies having to recruit their top team from the US. But, says Paul Walker, chief executive of Sage, software companies should also think more laterally and bring in top-level experience from European companies in other sectors.“You don’t need to stay in the software sector. You should find people from other sectors who have great experience in running companies. They can learn what they need to about software relatively quickly,” he says.Some, such as Mitchell Kertzmann, former chief executive of Sybase and Powersoft, currently partner at Hummer-Winblad, the venture capital firm, dispute the extent to which management experience matters.“I am sceptical of the hypothesis that experienced management is the key to a successful company,” he says. “When things get tough - as they so often do for small software companies - founder entrepreneurs are more likely to be willing to die in a ditch for the company than experienced managers brought in from the outside.”The prognosis for European software, despite all this, is far from gloomy. As new disruptive trends hit the market - such as the move to open source, XML, commoditisation of hardware, and rapid expansion of broadband networks - there is an opportunity for European companies to grab the initiative.“Conditions are not necessarily permanent, “ says Mr Kertzmann. “The US might stumble - all this regulation around Sarbanes-Oxley, for example, could be very distracting for companies.”Leo Apotheker, head of global field operations at SAP, believes the move towards service-based software architecture could be a new opportunity for European companies to compete on a level playing field with their US rivals.But Mr Apotheker warns that it is not just the US giants that Europe needs to worry about. Chinese and Indian companies are coming in equally fast to take advantage of disruption. “If we miss this opportunity, we won’t have another chance,” he warns. “We might be sitting here in five or 10 years time, and the list of the world’s biggest software companies could be all Asian.”The Demise of the European Software Industry: “Two Minute Warning” by Adam Hale, published in March 2005 as part of the Prince’s Trust and Technology Leadership Group initiatives
445;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-03-09T06:09:20Z;Big issues for operators as worlds collide;;People use mobile phones when they are on the move, landline telephony at home, and TV cable for films - at present, these still represent strictly separate worlds.Yet developers have been working on ushering in a new era of telecommunications for some time now. The industry faces a complete reorganisation of business models. Soon the cordless landline phone will be sending data from the local swimming pool, and TV sets will go online and source high-speed internet links to display films on screen.Fixed network operators, in particular, are trying to stabilise their eroding revenue base by “poaching” in business fields of other providers. However, even mobile operators feel the end is nigh for the heady phase of growth. “Growth rates in this industry will soon be single-digit,” says a high-ranking manager of a mobile telephony provider.Operators of TV cable networks are also looking for fresh sources of revenue. “The growth period is over in many lines of business. Accordingly, providers are trying to penetrate into related business segments,” says Nikolaus Mohr, a telecoms expert with Accenture, a consultancy company. According to Thomas Goette, partner with the consultancy Diamond Cluster, fixed network groups in particular now face the challenge of competing with mobile telephony providers. “They’re pushing the convergence ahead,” he says.For instance, BT Group in the UK is banking on making its landline phones ready for mobile telephony. The phones will automatically access the fixed network when used at home and switch to the mobile telephony network of BT’s partner, Vodafone, while users are on the road.BT recently reported that the tests on the “Bluephone project” were quite promising. “The first uninterrupted transfer of a telephone call between BT’s landline network and the mobile telephony service was successful. This represents a major step for the launch of Bluephone this spring,” it said.Yet the mobile telephony operators are fighting back. At this year’s CeBIT, for the first time ever, Vodafone will be presenting live television on a mobile phone. T-Mobile is banking on mobile telephony devices that can use wireless Lan (local area network) technology to access the fixed network for surfing on the web. Mobile phones “are developing from a communication to an entertainment tool”, says Sanjiv Ahuja, chief executive of Orange, the mobile telephony subsidiary of France Telecom.Orange has just announced the launch of a data chip that will enable mobile phone users to switch between mobile and landline telephony services. Using this chip, Orange customers will be able to surf the web using their mobile phones when on the road and at home.Deutsche Telekom is also trying to upgrade its fast DSL (digital subscriber line) internet access lines. In doing so, the company is initially, and mainly, targeting TV cable operators. At the same time, the cable companies are extending the range of their products and services for telephony and internet access via television cables.Full integration of mobile telephony with landline communications will take a while to accomplish, but seems to be unstoppable. “In principle, we perceive a tendency towards integration,” says Mr Goette at Diamond Cluster. In particular, pricing bundles of fixed network and mobile telephony offers are currently being created.At CeBIT 2005, Mr Mohr at Accenture expects “at least early prototypes” of devices that combine fixed network and mobile telephony features. “This will be the keynote topic at next year’s technology trade fair at the latest,” he says.These advances are being facilitated by changes in network technology. Above all, fixed operators are retooling their infrastructure in line with Internet Protocol (IP) technology. This enables networks to send data in small packages to their intended recipient and to reassemble the data on arrival, saving space on the network and boosting efficiency.Moreover, mobile telephony providers are gradually changing their networks to provide IP functionalities. This is the only way in which devices can migrate smoothly between the two network types.“The IP technology in networks is the key,” says Mr Mohr. “The new possibilities of offering different services rolled into one device will open up new business models and simultaneously trigger renewed pressure on prices.”More CeBIT 2005 articles

The company's founders, John and Leonard van Geest, moved from the Netherlands in the 1930s, appropriately setting up business in the Lincolnshire bulb fields. Bananas, for which Geest was known for decades, were the fruits of a later expansion in 1951.In one of those coincidences of history, the Dutch van Geests who stayed behind also sold their business this week. Geest North Sea Line, a shipping and logistics company owned by Jakob van Geest and his two brothers, has been bought by Samskip of - you guessed it - Iceland.ScramlingtonThe Peter Chambers era at Framlington Group lasted only 18 months. The fund management group said on Tuesday that Chambers, former chief investment officer at Gartmore, had resigned as chief executive with immediate effect.Insiders said the move reflected personality rather than financial issues. Lord Douro, the chairman, will be chief executive until a successor is found. Ian Barnetson, an asset management strategy partner at Accenture, was named chief operating officer.Many were surprised by Chambers' move in 2003 because Gartmore was seen as more adventurous - for example, in hedge funds - although both managers' investors were caught in the split-capital debacle.Framlington, however, had already signalled its ambitions in 2002 by hiring Nigel Thomas and George Luckraft from ABN Amro.Chambers first became well known as chief strategist at James Capel. He was then part of an economics and strategy team that included Keith Skeoch, who also left broking for a more elevated post, eventually becoming chief executive of Standard Life Investments. Since life has been fairly fraught for Skeoch, given shortfalls on Standard Life endowments, both might wish they had stayed in calmer waters.Just desertsWhen Mudlark last heard from Oliver Corbett, his swollen ankle was strapped up, and he was wondering, as his wife had all along, whether this was really a good idea.

His exertions will raise money for the Portobello Trust.Corbett is practising by running home each day from the City to Fulham, usually taking an indirect 13-mile route. It gives him plenty of time to mull the fine points of SVB's annual results, due to be presented on March 17.Free to EyreAfter countless missed shots at winning radio licences down the years, Richard Eyre, the former head of Capital Radio, ITV and Pearson Television, has finally bagged one.

447;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Understanding your audience is key;;"Macbeth, Shakespeare's bloody tragedy, may not seem an obvious play to take the kids to. But a recent production by the Royal Shakespeare Company sold more family tickets than would have normally been bargained on.Last year the RSC nearly tripled the number of family tickets sold for Shakespearian productions compared with 2003 - no mean feat given that such tickets are usually the preserve of the RSC's non-Shakespearian performances such as Beauty and the Beast.According to Kate Horton, the RSC's commercial director, the increase would not have been achieved without the aid of marketing know-how and sophisticated customer analysis courtesy of Accenture, the world's largest consulting group that is also the RSC's corporate business partner.Accenture has always had a hint of limelight and greasepaint about it. Vernon Ellis, the group's international chairman, is president of the Classical Opera Company and vice-chairman of English National Opera. It works with La Scala in Italy and sponsors the Rheingau Musik Festival in Germany.But the consulting group's first season with the RSC in 2004 highlighted how arts sponsorship can prove more effective than just financial support - which Accenture also provides to the RSC's productions in London and Stratford, Shakespeare's birthplace.More radically, Accenture is using its consulting skills to help the RSC understand who comes to its shows and why, and how they could be encouraged to enjoy the experience more often.A mailing campaign to persuade families who regularly attend non-Shakespearian productions to try Shakespeare is one of the early successes of the partnership.""The biggest marketing issue for the RSC is its lack of understanding of its audiences,"" explains Ms Horton. ""As a subsidised company, we have little in the way of resources to invest in technology. [Before Accenture's involvement], we had a ticketing database that could tell us virtually nothing. It was a big, black hole.""Accenture's involvement followed the theatre organisation's well-publicised struggle for stability after an ill-judged decision in 2001/02 to leave its London home in the Barbican Centre to redevelop its showpiece theatre in Stratford.In 2003, Adrian Noble resigned as artistic director and was replaced by Michael Boyd. With morale and finances improving, the scene was set for an attack on the company's marketing shortcomings.Enter a team of consultants, stage left, with a bag of analytical tricks. What Accenture is able to do for the RSC in terms of segmenting and analysing its audience is no more complex than what it routinely does for, say, a financial services group with a similar problem. Customer relationship management is the jargon for the portfolio of software packages and analytical techniques.But Mark Foster, Accenture group chief executive responsible for the project, notes that arts organisations are different. ""The RSC joins the dots in a different way,"" he says.Accenture needed a more sensitive and lower cost approach. John Zealley, Accenture's CRM specialist who took charge of operations, says: ""We quickly came to the conclusion that we needed to do something pretty swiftly which would make a real impact. Otherwise we would just become another commercial sponsorship where you lay out money. Maybe you get brand recognition, but you do not make a difference.""The RSC already had four years of ticketing information from Stratford, including names, addresses, shows attended and price paid - in total, some 2m records from 210,000 separate bookings. Accenture fed the data into a Teradata computer - a machine specially designed to process masses of data - using analytical software from the UK company Alterian and the US group Knowledge Extraction Engines.This enabled the identification of eight groups of customers previously hidden in the welter of statistics. These included regulars, people who come at least four times a year and provide 56 per cent of the box-office take, ""Swans"" - those who only want to attend plays in Stratford's smaller theatre, internet bookers, the fastest growing group, and families tempted by special family shows.It was then possible to overlay further demographic information on this structure for marketing purposes. Although it is still early days, the results are already being fed back into the RSC's marketing initiatives with promising results.So promising, in fact, that the Arts Council of England, the RSC's chief source of external subsidy, is examining the project to see whether other arts organisations could profit from the RSC's experience.Other commercial organisations exist to help arts organisations in a similar way, but Ms Horton argues they are beyond the scope of investment budgets. ""The arts in the UK are collectively quite big but look like a number of small corner shops. They don't have the kind of buying power an industry of this size perhaps should.""And the whiff of the greasepaint helped. Mr Foster, Mr Zeally and the rest of the small group who volunteered to work with the RSC admit to being frustrated thespians.This bridged the gap between the consultants and the players, although as Mr Zealley laments: ""The part of third pikeman has not been offered to me yet."""
448;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-02-06T17:24:15Z;Making a corporate marriage work;;"The deal has been signed, the analysts have been charmed and the press conference is over. But before placing an extra order for tomorrow's newspapers, the wise chief executive will remember that the hardest part of a merger or acquisition is just about to start.Bringing two companies together is an enormous task, as executives at Procter & Gamble and Gillette, the consumer goods giants that announced a deal last month, will now be discovering. There are grand, big- picture questions that need to be resolved, such as the new group's strategy and direction. There are also administrative, logistical and technical challenges. Will new contracts of employment be required? Where should the headquarters of the combined operation be located? How can the companies' information technology systems be integrated?""It takes a certain humility to make a merger work,"" says Charles Hampden-Turner, co-author of Building Cross-cultural Competence. ""It doesn't follow that your company is a better one simply because it has taken another company over. It just means that you've got more money and have been prepared to pay,"" he says. ""You should be ready to sit down and learn from the acquired business. There may be expertise there that needs to be respected.""Work on bringing the partners together should start well before the deal becomes public knowledge. Ravi Chanmugam, a partner at Accenture, the management consultancy, says: ""In essence, there should not be separate M&A and post-merger integration processes, but a holistic approach to the deal, from strategy to target identification and valuation to integration.""But how can executives start planning integration without the news leaking out? Some use a so-called ""clean room"", where trusted counter-parties to a deal can meet and discuss future plans confidentially. Computer manufacturers Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, for example, adopted this approach in their $25bn (£13.3bn) merger in 2002.Speed is of the essence. Roger Pudney of the UK's Ashridge business school says: ""There is often a tendency for companies to relax once the deal is signed, but this is precisely the point at which speed of implementation becomes crucial. Successful M&A companies stress the importance of quick wins as a way of demonstrating that the new combination is already producing added value.""HP and Compaq ran a series of ""Fast Start"" seminars for their staff as soon as the deal was announced, to provide reassurance and a sense of direction - seminars that had been planned in advance in the clean room.Offering employees detailed information is essential at the early stage. An internal human resources website set up for HP and Compaq staff received 2m hits on the day the merger was unveiled.Managers will inevitably be occupied with practical, administrative changes, such as establishing new terms and conditions and pushing through any redundancies. Yet dealing with the cultural issues in a merger is more subtle and challenging. And when things go wrong in this context they can go wrong very quickly. Witnesses to board meetings of the newly-merged Carnaud Metal Box in 1989, for instance, recalled that French and British directors at times refused even to speak to each other.Michelle Bligh, a professor at Claremont Graduate University, California, has suggested measures leaders should take to avoid the worst consequences of mergers.After studying a merger of health organisations in the US, Prof Bligh advised leaders to avoid taking a dictatorial, top-down approach or micro-managing the transition. They need to respond as the new situation demands, she says, and must ""help followers negotiate, modify and even manipulate cultural similarities and differences in the post-merger environment"".Prof Bligh identifies a few simple ground rules. Managers should recognise cultural differences between the companies, for example, by learning about the history of the new partner. They should give employees reasons why change is necessary, and find practical ways of communicating. As one manager told her: ""When you sit down and start showing employees the nitty-gritty, you get buy-in a lot quicker.""Symbolism matters too. ""Instead of making great speeches,"" Dr Hampden-Turner suggests, ""why not start acting differently and providing a lead that way? Words are too easy, but actions will be noticed."" Even apparently mundane gestures can count. Discussing employees' new working conditions and being visible on the ""shop floor"", for example, may reassure staff that management has an interest in their well-being. One manager in Prof Bligh's study said: ""We have to start with the little things: they really matter to people.""Nevertheless, the post-merger period can be a draining, emotionally-charged time for staff. Reflecting on her experience of the healthcare merger, a nurse said: ""The emotions were so strong, I would rather have my skin peeled off than go through that again."" Counselling services or an employee assistance programme can provide a useful outlet for tensions among staff.How do the most successful acquirers handle the process of merger integration? General Electric, the US engineering conglomerate, has made more than 400 acquisitions in the past 20 years. But it is still learning how to make these deals work better. When GE bought Amersham, the UK bioscience company, in 2003 for $9bn, it made a big effort to reassure the acquired business that it would not be steam-rollered.Steve Bolze, now president and chief executive of GE Healthcare Technologies International, led the integration team on the deal. ""This is the first major GE business to be headquartered outside the US,"" he says. ""That sends a strong signal to the employees.""The deal was also based on robust business principles. ""We had very clear revenue and cost-saving targets in year one,"" he adds, ""and we carried out six months' planning between the announcement and the close of the deal, with people from both companies on the steering committee. We beat our specific integration targets, managing over $100m of synergies in 2004.""Talk of a revival in merger and acquisitions activity is on the rise. Investment bankers and management consultants are once again seeking out potential deals and making flattering noises as they lead candidates to the altar. But marriages succeed or fail in the years following the wedding. Even before the hangover has worn off, the hard work has to begin."
449;ACN;Accenture Plc;2005-02-02T18:08:22Z;From a handout to a hand up;;"As the World Economic Forum calls for action from all sides to tackle poverty, disease and the lack of education, some answers to the world's challenges are already emerging from boardrooms around the globe.One trend is for companies to begin working together, alongside governments and development agencies, on problems too big for any one group to handle alone, such as the Aids pandemic.""We are definitely seeing a much more sophisticated approach from companies that have been pioneers of community work,"" says Jane Nelson, an international expert on corporate responsibility and author of Partnering for Success, a report from the World Economic Forum's project on global corporate citizenship.""Companies such as Rio Tinto, Anglo American, SC Johnson and Deutsche Bank are recognising that they need to move beyond one-off, ad hoc, community-type investment to much more systemic initiatives.""These initiatives range from alliances to tackle corruption - such as the UK government-led Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative - to programmes for better public services and infrastructure.In South Africa, for example, 150 companies - including Accenture, Deloitte, PwC and Anglo American - are working with the education ministry, school administrators, parent/teacher associations and non-governmental organisations to improve education and facilities in state-run schools.At the global level, the United Nations Development Programme is helping forge partnerships in Africa, Asia and central America between big business, governments, donors and local entrepreneurs. The dual aim of the initiative - called Growing Sustainable Business for Poverty Reduction - is to encourage businesses that target poor consumers and improve links between big companies and small local enterprises.It is not easy to make such partnerships work, especially with many participants whose goals and expectations may differ. ""This is not the panacea that is going to solve the world's international development challenges,"" Ms Nelson cautions. But she argues that the benefits of partnerships linked to business goals are potentially greater and more sustainable than corporate philanthropy.One accusation levelled at corporate social responsibility is that it is too often divorced from the core business and can therefore lack influence and sustainability. A key feature of many new initiatives is that they relate directly to, and benefit, the business.Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Anglo American and of the 180-member Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, says it is in the interests of multinational companies to operate in well-functioning, rather than fractured, societies.He cites Anglo American's partnership with the South African government in the Khula Mining Fund that invests in small black empowerment companies in the sector. ""You might say: 'What are you doing encouraging future competition?' In our opinion, this is contributing to stability in the industry and addressing smaller mining activities we wouldn't do ourselves. It creates employment and reduces societal stress.""The Shell Foundation is also looking at sustainable solutions to social and environmental problems linked to the core business of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. It has piloted two investment funds that provide loans to small entrepreneurs in the energy sector in Uganda and South Africa.These funds target two problems: the lack of access to energy among poor rural households and the fact that small business growth is often hampered by poor governance, corruption and the unwillingness of banks to make risky loans.By using the Shell group's reputation as an inward investor, the foundation persuaded local banks to put up capital alongside its own finance. The funds offered a 5 per cent net rate of return that, although below commercial levels, was attractive enough to interest local banks.This different approach to corporate social responsibility is attracting attention, notably at Royal Dutch/Shell but also at other multinationals, says Chris West, deputy director of the foundation and a former senior environment adviser to two UK ministers for international development.""The idea is that if you put the viability of the business first, with potential financial returns, the development benefits will follow, rather than the other way around. Without financial viability, there is no prospect of scaling up these programmes to reach more of the poor.""A related approach is for companies to target what C.K. Prahalad, the US-based management writer, has called ""the fortune at the bottom of the pyramid"". His argument is that companies should stop seeing the 4bn people who live on less than $2 a day as a problem and start seeing them as a potential market for innovative products and services.For more than 40 years, Citigroup has supported micro-finance initiatives as a form of philanthropy. Last year, however, it decided to look at them as a business opportunity as well. It appointed a senior banker to develop services and products for micro-lending programmes, initially in Mexico and India.One example was a bond issued last year by Banamex, Citigroup's Mexican subsidiary, on behalf of Compartamos, a microfinance institution that wants to expand its customer base of mainly rural, female entrepreneurs to 1m by 2008.Pam Flaherty, senior vice-president for global community relations at Citigroup, says the group's aim is to develop ""a full range of banking services for the poor"". But this is not a standard commercial proposition.""There is not going to be a huge short-term profit,"" Ms Flaherty says. ""But we think there is long-term potential. We can learn how to expand our market even more, and the best way seems to be this initiative.""The reputations of both Shell and Citigroup are under fire - the former over its reserves scandal, the latter over its controversial bond trading. Many companies see social programmes as a way to improve their reputation, especially when trust has been battered by scandals. High-profile philanthropic gestures may create a short-term image boost. But involvement in ways to alleviate poverty and disease could be more effective in rebuilding trust over the long term - provided they do not merely exploit undeveloped markets.That has yet to be proven on a large scale. But companies need to seize the opportunities now, according to Ann Florini, director of the World Economic Forum's global governance initiative.While she emphasises that primary responsibility rests with governments, she says the private sector has a crucial role to play. Bad or corrupt business practices contribute to conflict, poverty, human rights abuses and environmental decline. Conversely, responsible and profitable businesses offer huge potential to innovate, create wealth, share technology and improve the quality of life of millions of people in the developing world.""It is not enough to avoid harm,"" says Ms Florini, who is senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""The business sector needs to be actively thinking about positive steps it can take, partly to restore trust and partly in its own interests. Businesses that catch on to this more quickly and start positioning themselves, not just in PR terms but in terms of business strategies, are the ones that are going to benefit very substantially in the long term.""CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY HAS ITS LIMITSBusiness has become the “whipping boy” in the development debate, according to Sir Digby Jones, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry.He says that while companies could do better, governments in the developed and developing worlds should do more to address civil conflict, endemic corruption, trade barriers and subsidies. Consumers must also do their bit. “People are forgetting that other elements of our society have a social responsibility,” he says.The pressure on business raises the question of where private sector responsibility begins and ends.“There is an accountability issue here and a democracy issue,” says Ronnie Goldberg, senior vice-president for policy at the US Council for International Business. “We need to be careful. We do not want to live in a world in which unelected entities such as corporations are looked on to provide the basic services of government,” she says.It is for governments to create the conditions - such as security and the protection of human rights - that ensure that development aid reaches the right people and that companies want to invest. “The biggest contribution companies can make to reducing poverty is investment and bringing jobs,” Ms Goldberg adds."

This means it is contributing £1m ($1.9m) or more to the efforts of Lord Coe, the former athlete running London's bid, to dash Paris's hopes by bringing the Games to Britain for the first time in more than 60 years. Its presence gives an international flavour to a list of sponsors that also includes British Airways, BT, Virgin Atlantic and Accenture.In fact, the initiative is by no means as strange as it might at first appear. As the former London Electricity Group, EDF Energy is the British capital's chief power supplier and it would stand to benefit if the Games came to London. ""We want to put ourselves in a strong position for the provision of infrastructure for the Games, should the bid be successful,"" says John Morris, the company's programme director for the bid.""The implications of a successful bid would be a massive regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley area of east London resulting in new homes, sports facilities and generally reinvigorating the community. In addition, it will accelerate the development of Thames Gateway, the biggest regeneration project in Europe. Our involvement gives us the opportunity to be part of all this by assisting with the energy infrastructure plans and being seen as one of the companies which helped bring the Games to London.""Besides possibly helping to secure new business, EDF Energy's decision to back the London bid appears to be striking example of the lengths to which multi-nationals will go to create a positive image in their main non-domestic markets. ""The vision that EDF Group has of the role of its subsidiaries in various countries - the UK, Italy, Germany or others - is very much about them acting locally,"" says Vincent de Rivaz, EDF Energy's chief executive. ""We are selling products which are essential for any social life; when there's no power, social life stops. This gives us a special responsibility and that is deeply local.""For me, it was the most natural choice as the power company of London, as a key UK energy company, to back [London 2012]. You know, we are Londoners; our roots are in London. [The EDF group] were delighted to see that I was able to be personally connected with the people in charge of London 2012. Being welcomed by them as a sponsor is evidence that EDF Energy was welcome in the UK and specifically in London. It's very positive for the image of the whole group to see that EDF Energy is backing London.""Mr De Rivaz cites other reasons for backing London's bid. For one thing, the timing was good, with the opportunity coming just as the company needed to establish its new EDF Energy name. ""I created EDF Energy in 2003,"" he says. ""It's a new brand. For us, being a Premier Partner gives us a high profile as a national sponsor with other big names.""He contends that the sponsorship has helped to get employees pulling together in the same direction as well. ""The creation of a new company, with 11,500 employees who came from a collection of diverse companies with various names and various logos . . . is always a heck of a challenge. When I did this rebranding, creating EDF Energy, my main objective was to get all the people united behind one name.""[For employees] backing the bid has been a cause of pride. It's the first time for these employees that their company has made [such a sizeable] commitment to a national, an international event. Our business has left behind a sort of parochial approach to fly its flag high in a wonderful cause.""He suggests, moreover, that getting employees involved in the bid can help to make them more effective. ""The most important thing is to engage our people behind the bid, to transform them into ambassadors for it. This leads them to think a little bit out of the box . . . It has raised their game. They are thinking a little bit bigger and it is energising."" According to Mr Morris, the company is looking to recruit as many as 3,000 Olympic - more than 25 per cent of the workforce.The company is ""looking to work with the Greater London Authority to create a Clean Up London campaign"" to coincide with the potentially critical visit by the International Olympic Committee's evaluation commission next month.There is also the small matter of more than 10m envelopes that the company's retail businesses will send out to customers in the first half of 2005. These will all carry a Back the Bid message on them.There are some employees it should not be too hard to persuade to play ball. Donna Fraser, the British 400m runner, works for the company. So too does Brendon Bowes, the father of the multi-Olympic medal-winning cyclist Bradley Wiggins."
451;ACN;Accenture Plc;2004-12-26T17:50:43Z;Don't let your rivals leave you behind;;"You have read a lot this year about jobs being exported to low wage economies such as China, India and the Philippines. In common with most companies, your supply chain went global in the 1990s. The jobs now migrating offshore are not manufacturing but technical and clerical: financial analysis, computer programming, customer service, back office finance and human resources.If you have not considered getting this kind of work done offshore, you should. The cost savings can be substantial. In a low margin industry, this could be the difference between profit and loss.Perhaps more importantly, the drift of white collar jobs offshore is a sign that your competitors are starting to rethink what functions and processes need to be kept within the company. For the sake of long-term competitiveness you do not want to be left behind.Ask yourself why your company remains vertically integrated in areas such as after sales services, finance and human resources. You would not dream of manufacturing your own roller bearings or making the paper that goes into your packaging. So why do you process your own invoices?Until recently, of course, you had no choice. There were no third-party suppliers to take these drudge tasks off your hands. But that is changing. Professional services companies such as Accenture and Bearingpoint, information technology outfits such as International Business Machines and EDS, and specialist outsourcers such as Infosys and Wipro all believe they can make money by handling business processes more efficiently.The proximate cause is the onward march of information technology. Remember the enterprise software systems, typically from the German provider SAP, that you spent most of the 1990s grappling with? Well, it turns out that almost every company in your industry has the same software and, by implication, almost identical business processes. The potential for economies of scale should be obvious.Of course, cost savings are not the only reason to look at outsourcing. Remember all that talk in your MBA course about ""core competencies"" being the only enduring source of competitive advantage? Well, is form-filling really a core competence for your organisation?Once you have taken the decision to outsource, it is inevitable that the work will be done in the location that offers the best combination of low cost and high quality of service. Increasingly, but not always, that means offshore.The good news is that you do not need to dive head first into this new wave of outsourcing. Many of your competitors have organised their back office functions into a single ""shared services"" organisation that supports every company in the group. As a first step, you should do the same. It might even make sense to build your own offshore administration or information technology centre.Once this has been accomplished, decide whether these services contribute to your competitive advantage. If not, outsourcing may be the answer.For an example of best practice, look to General Electric. In the late 1990s, the conglomerate built an administrative and technical centre in India to provide GE companies with everything from financial analysis to software engineering. Last month it sold majority control of the operation to a private equity group, in effect outsourcing a wide range of services.A few words of caution, however. First, today's non-core business process could be tomorrow's core competence. JP Morgan Chase recently cancelled a $5bn (£2.6bn), seven-year IT outsourcing contract with IBM because Jamie Dimon, the bank's CEO-in-waiting, believes information technology is a core competency in financial services.Second, the terms of any outsourcing contract are vital. How will the supplier get paid? What key performance indicators will be used to judge whether the service provided is up to scratch? What happens if you want to walk away from the deal? Third, keep employees informed at all times. People do not appreciate having their jobs shipped to Mumbai or Shanghai. Tread carefully.Also, take nothing for granted. Your competitors may be rushing headlong into offshoring and outsourcing. That does not mean that it makes sense for your company.Consider Dell's approach. While most of its competitors have outsourced computer assembly to contract manufacturers, or moved their factories offshore, Dell continues to make computers for the North American market on US soil.The company believes that having factories close to customers gives it a competitive advantage; it continues to be the lowest-cost producer of PCs.The moral: blindly following your competitors is the equivalent of outsourcing strategy. This is not a good idea."

After initial interest from about 20 parties, it whittled suitors to a handful. Blackstone, the US private equity group, was then ejected after refusing to lift its offer from 220p a share. That left Hines, two unnamed groups and a consortium of Westfield of Australia and Tishman Speyer of the US. It is thought that none is offering more than 300p.Therein lies the problem. It is understood that Andrew Rosenfeld, chief executive, and Sir David Garrard, chairman, want something closer to 370p a share, or £600m, Minerva's last stated net asset value. Anything much lower would represent a potential loss of face. But bidders are loath to up their offers, given that Minerva's three most high-profile projects - still unbuilt - carry development risk. And so, so far, stalemate.All the basesPicture the scene. Singapore, July 6 2005. Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, strides towards the microphone. Necks crane in the silent room as his audience waits to hear who will host the 2012 Olympic Games. A last intake of breath. ""And the winner is . . . Accenture.""Five cities - London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris - will be kept on tenterhooks for another seven months before they know the outcome. But the management consulting, technology services and outsourcing firm can already be pretty sure it has backed the winner.This is not through any great insight on Accenture's part. It is just that, with this week's announcement that it has joined Paris 2012's ""corporate club"", Accenture, clearly a true multinational, is backing four of the five horses. Only Moscow, the rank outsider, has so far failed to attract its support.Accenture says its involvement in ""multiple Olympic city bids"" is ""consistent with our global approach to supporting the communities in which we do business. Our support of the various Olympic city bids is driven and administered locally. . .From a corporate standpoint, we do not favour one bid over another.""Imprint makes markBrian Hamill looked around the table at the meeting called to seal a takeover that his Imprint Search and Selection had been chasing for nearly a year. Of the 15 advisers present, Imprint had placed five in their current jobs. ""I was paying for my own advice,"" he said.Imprint will pay up to £14m for ECHM Group, owner of Executive Connections and Hitchenor Maher, placement agencies specialising in accountancy jobs in the £25,000to £70,000 range. A share placing at 140p will raise £9.15m.The deal takes Imprint into a new, lower salary tier. ""We're looking for depth of penetration through clients,"" Hamill said. Imprint limits itself to one or two clients in each sector. ""We need to be able to fish in the rest."" Imprint has its eyes on another potential target, in sales and marketing.Opening an accountSenior executives move to rival banks more rarely in France than they do in the more footloose Anglo-Saxon world. So it's a bit of a coup for BNP Paribas to hire Alain Papiasse, 49, as head of its asset management and services division.Papiasse, who joins the executive committee of BNP Paribas, had been chief operating officer of Calyon, the investment banking subsidiary of the merged Crédit Agricole and Crédit Lyonnais, until he left in May. Previously, Papiasse headed Credit Lyonnais Asset Management.He replaces Vivien Lévy-Garboua, who has been given the newly created role of head of compliance.

453;ACN;Accenture Plc;2004-12-07T18:19:19Z;AT&T team wins $1bn network deal;;AT&T, the US telecoms group, and a team of subcontractors have won a contract valued at up to $1bn to design, build and manage a secure IP-based global network for the US government that will serve 1,000 US locations and support tens of thousands of users in the US and overseas.The deal with the US Treasury's Treasury Communications Enterprise agency, underscores AT&T's decision to focus on big enterprise and government business and move away from providing traditional consumer telephone services.AT&T management believes that its ability to build and operate large, complex network systems such as this will help the company differentiate itself from other telecoms service providers in the increasingly competitive US market.The highly secure communications system built around an IP VPN (Virtual Private Network) is believed to be the largest civilian network of its type and will support all the Treasury's agencies providing advanced voice, video and data services.It will enable Treasury personnel to communicate with any location or data centre over a common, low-cost network infrastructure that will also accommodate future requirements, such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and real-time video conferencing services.Using a common web-based interface, Treasury users will also have access to online ordering, billing, help desk support and network performance information so they can actively manage the network.The subcontracting team includes Accenture, the IT consultancy, BAE Systems, GTSI, Lucent Technologies and SRA International. ?We have assembled the best companies in the industry to assist us in implementing a secure IP network that will accommodate the future convergence of voice and data while transitioning smoothly from current technology,? said Lou Addeo, president of AT&T Government Solutions.AT&T shares closed down 4 cents to $18.54 in New York on Tuesday. They have fallen by 8.5 per cent this year, reflecting concerns about competition in the market for traditional voice services delivered to corporate customers.
454;ACN;Accenture Plc;2004-12-02T21:20:21Z;Mudlark: Equitable case goes behind closed doors;;"A veil of secrecy descended on Thursday over the hitherto open legal warfare between Equitable Life, its former auditors Ernst & Young and its former directors.All three parties involved in the multi-billion pound negligence and breach of duty actions that the troubled mutual is bringing against its former auditors and directors met for a hearing in London's High Court. But unlike all previous hearings, this one was declared to be in private, with ferocious notices posted on courtroom doors to ensure no one strayed in by accident.Why such secrecy? In general, courts only go into private session where matters of commercial confidence or delicate personal issues are involved. Even then, efforts are usually made to ensure non-sensitive portions remain open. This time, though, the official line from parties involved was that it was a ""logistics"" meeting - designed to discuss issues arising from the monster trial that looms in April if the parties don't settle.These, admittedly, are deep waters. Does the High Court actually have a courtroom that will seat 17 separate parties, most of which will have well-padded teams of lead barristers, juniors and solicitors? Are witnesses really to be subjected to multiple cross-examination?A potential spate also seems to have been brewing over technology, such as instant transcripts, and who should fork out for this.But surely the real point is that, if Equitable were to lose, the society's policyholders would be saddled with costs of the six-month-plus trial, already at tens of millions of pounds.They might, therefore, be a little interested in what is being organised. According to one spokesman, the lawyers felt that this was ""an informal meeting"" and that it was so ""boring"" that the ""in private"" instruction was justified. Not so boring when that sort of bill lands on the doormat.Suddenly so fussyAccenture employees are excited about their imminent move to 30 Fenchurch Street, a fine 15-storey structure recently put up by British Land in the heart of the City.Why is the management consultancy insisting on such a banal name?The building's real monicker is, of course, One Plantation Place. Surely Accenture - masters of business-speak - couldn't possibly think that the word ""plantation"" is politically incorrect, could it?Plantation House, which used to cover most of the site, was London's commodity-trading complex.Originally built in 1936, it served traders in tea, sugar, coffee and metals. After British Land bought the site and began work on the new building, an archaeological excavation by the Museum of London found 46 gold Roman coins - the largest gold bullion find in the City.Any future tenants taking the same PC approach to British Land's neighbouring scheme, Plantation Place 2, may have a dilemma: it backs on to Mincing Lane.Growing, growingThe billionaire boys featured prominently last night at the Confederation of British Industry's Growing Business Awards. Philip Green, perhaps the biggest of them all, was gonged the entrepreneurs' entrepreneur, succeeding Sir Richard Branson. He fought off competition from rival rich-list heavyweights Sir Terry Matthews, John Caudwell, Sir Ken Morrison and Simon Fuller.Hours after delivering his pre-budget report, Gordon Brown spoke to the 650 guests, praising entrepreneurs' contribution to the wider economy.Betfair, the UK's biggest betting website after just four years, was named company of the year, while Simon Nixon, founder of Moneysupermarket.com, was entrepreneur of the year.No chicken KievPerhaps bravely, considering the turmoil in his homeland, Ihor Mitiukov, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, kept his appointment on Thursday to speak at a British-Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce lunch.His remarks were covered by Chatham House rules, but Mudlark understands he steered a neutral course. A photo of the occasion, however, might have sent a different message. By coincidence, the backdrop at the London Chamber of Commerce was bright orange, the campaign colour of Viktor Yushchenko, under whom Mitiukov served as finance minister.Friendly skiesBernard Swanepoel, Harmony's chief executive, found himself face to face with Ian Cockerill of Gold Fields, target of Harmony's hostile bid, as they waited to board the same flight from Johannesburg to London.

But Anglogold has also been cited as a potential bidder.'Ouch' in voucherAn acrimonious legal battle between two voucher promotion companies traded on Aim was settled after the chairman of Landround admitted he had falsely accused an executive director of rival MKM Group of supervising the theft of Landround's database.According to a statement read out in the High Court yesterday, Peter Carter of Landround made the allegation against MKM's Victor Koch in a telephone conversation with David Youngman of WH Ireland. The stockbroker was handling MKM's flotation; it had acted for Landround but was dropped when it went to work for its rival.Carter also falsely claimed that a judge had granted a search-and-seizure injunction on the eve of MKM's flotation, and that bailiffs would be visiting its offices.

455;ACN;Accenture Plc;2004-11-28T18:14:15Z;Lucy Kellaway: Personal stories best left untold;;"Steve sat by the hospital bed and wept. His father, at the age of just 55, had had a massive stroke and was paralysed down one side. As the son's tears fell, the father opened his eyes, and suddenly Steve knew everything was going to be all right.Zoe stared down at the pregnancy predictor. Positive. This was at least three years before she had planned a baby. She looked in the mirror to check her response, and found she was grinning from ear to ear.Why am I telling you these intimate little stories? At the top of this column it says ""On Work"". This is meant to give readers a clue that if they feel like reading about work, then they are in the right place. It is also meant to give them a clue that if they feel like reading about strokes and pregnancy tests they are in the wrong place, as these are not to do with work, which is one of the reasons work is so soothing.If you are employed by Accenture, however, you will know it is more complicated than that. Zoe and Steve are Accenture consultants who are featured with eight others on a DVD revealing the sort of things that you would not generally share with your 100,000 closest colleagues.Ten Digital Stories is a sort of U-certificate Oprah Winfrey, in which people talk about their religion, disability and lack of success with contraceptive methods. Asha muses about how complicated her wedding is going to be as she is half Buddhist, half Muslim, and her fiancé is an Australian/Croatian Catholic. Samantha describes a birthmark on her baby's face which started swelling, and could have (though didn't) cost the infant her sight. Andy tells us that after a night drinking dodgy Turkish spirits in Bodrum he ended up in hospital having a terrifying panic attack, and has suffered from them since. (""I've never let them interfere with my work,"" he adds, in case anyone was worrying.)I watched the DVD in the privacy of my own sitting room, jaw slack, groaning quietly. There was one question in my head. Why? Actually, two questions: why are Steve, Zoe, Asha and Samantha doing this? And why has Accenture chosen to release their stories to the entire company?It wasn't just the 10 exhibitionists one wonders about. There were several hundred disappointed others all clamouring to tell their own digital stories, but who were not chosen. The motivation is doubtless similar to that which propels people towards the sacrificial altar of reality TV. Most of us crave attention and even sensible Accenture consultants sometimes do some pretty odd things to get it.But why did Accenture itself think this a good idea? The UK managing director gives two reasons. People work better if they understand their colleagues and the DVD helps them do this. It is also a celebration of how diverse the company is.On the first point, I don't see how understanding the people in your company makes you do your job better. There may be some personal details that are relevant to people who work closely together, but not many. If I were Steve's line manager I would want to know that his father had had a stroke. He would need time off, and forgiveness for any peculiar behaviour. However, for those who have never heard of Steve and work in Accenture offices half way around the world, the knowledge has no value whatsoever.However, according to the company's press office, Ten Digital Stories has gone down a storm. Eight thousand people have already downloaded it from the website. ""These short stories were wonderful, and to know they are about people we work with made them that much more enjoyable,"" says an unnamed consultant in Miami, whose quote the press office guilelessly informs me was ""unaided"".You could say this DVD creates a warm, fuzzy, family feeling by proving that Accenture employs human beings who have human emotions and experiences. But one sincerely hopes that most people in the company were working on that hypothesis anyway.Not only do warm, fuzzy feelings leave me cold, they are also bad business. It becomes much more difficult to discipline someone when they have shared their anguish over their baby's birthmark or their panic attacks with the entire company.Possibly a better reason for the DVD is as a demonstration of diversity, though even here I struggle to find anything to admire. What is the company trying to say in its choice of stories? On the DVD there are four Asian tales, all of which are fairly bland. Simply being Asian seems to be a help in getting picked to tell your story. The white consultants had to try a bit harder, coming up with stories involving sickness, disability or parenting. All tales are presented with an upbeat message in the end (""My dad is getting better; My baby is made special by her mark; My panic attacks are much less frequent now) and contain nothing that might be disturbing to Accenture clients.But what about all those other diverse personal experiences that in a big company such as Accenture someone must be living through right now? Where is the woman who has had an abortion following an illicit affair with her boss? Where is the woman who has breast cancer and is going to die? Where is the man whose life has been ruined by divorce, and who is fighting a nasty legal battle to see his kids?We will never hear about these stories, because they are real life, and real life can get very nasty - and that has no place at work. But neither does happy-ever-after real life.Lest I sound too negative, I will end this column by describing the part of the DVD I like. Zoe's story about her unplanned baby is called Delivery, which is cheering as it represents an unusual example of the consultant using this word in its proper context. Babies are delivered; High Performance - as in the company slogan ""High Performance. Delivered"" - is not.lucy.kellaway@ft.com"
456;ACN;Accenture Plc;2004-11-19T09:10:39Z;Waterford Wedgwood “at bottom” of trade decline;;Redmond O'Donoghue, chief executive of Waterford Wedgwood, expressed hope that the crystal and ceramics manufacturer was “at or close to the bottom” of its trading decline, as it reported an operating loss for the six months to September 30.Falling volumes and the strong dollar caused operating losses of €21.4m (£15m), against profits last time of €4.2m. Waterford makes half its sales in the US.The company made use of a €103m exceptional gain on disposal of All-Clad, its kitchen equipment subsidiary, offsetting exceptional financing costs of €43.8m and stock write-downs of €25.3m. As a result it recorded a pre-tax profit of €8.9m against losses last time of €44.8m.The company, which next week is set to announce a formal bid for Royal Doulton, the rival UK ceramics maker, saw sales fall 12 per cent from €405.8m to €356m, or 5 per cent on a like-for-like constant currency basis. Earnings per share were 0.76 cents (losses of 5.15 cents).Mr O'Donoghue said while “current trading remains difficult, indications on trading in November suggests some improvement”.Advised by Accenture, the company has discontinued 40 per cent of its stock items, and put factories on short-time working. The company is to seek shareholder approval next month for a 5-for-3 rights issue, raising €100m, to finance the Royal Doulton acquisition. The company earlier indicated the rights would be priced at 6 cents, although that would offer shareholders little incentive to take up their rights, given the current share price of about 6.2 cents.FT Comment● Sir Anthony O'Reilly, the chairman, with Peter Goulandris, his brother-in-law, owns 26 per cent of the company. They have agreed to underwrite 70 per cent of the planned rights to finance the Doulton purchase. He will seek shareholder approval to avoid the normal obligation to make an outright bid for the company if his stake is above 30 per cent the so-called whitewash waiverSir Anthony clearly is putting his money where his mouth is. The level of take up will demonstrate just how many other shareholders share his conviction that the company is now on the road to recovery.The signs of sales improvement are tentative at best, while there is no real evidence that the cash generation has improved. Debt is still €280.7m, against €429m a year ago, but this is despite the €197m generated from the sale of All-Clad, its kitchen equipment maker. You might expect the inventory write-down and the All-Clad sale to have had more impact on stocks, but they are just €18m lower than last year at €289m.
457;ACN;Accenture Plc;2004-11-17T07:23:33Z;Ralph Szygenda of General Motors;;"It’s outsourcing, but not as we know itFor the world’s big IT companies, Ralph Szygenda is perhaps the most important person around today.The 56-year old chief information officer of General Motors holds the purse strings for what he believes is the largest private-sector IT outsourcing deal ever: $15bn over the next five years. And he knows it.Mr Szygenda is using the power of the carmaker’s enormous outsourcing work, which will be up for bidding in 2006, to force fiercely competitive contractors to work together. To prepare for the bids, 13 technology service providers such as IBM, Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and Accenture are working full time at GM’s Warren technology centre in Michigan drawing up a set of 24 common standards for running different types of computer systems and networks.For EDS, approximately $2bn of annual revenue is at stake, more than 10 per cent of the company’s turnover. But for IT outsourcers globally the new standards could change the way the companies do business. The common processes for networks, software and computing will mean that GM’s IT managers will have to oversee only a handful of different management approaches; when things go wrong, there only be only one way of responding, rather than 13.“The real goal is that you should, when they fail to deliver the right service, be able to move to another company quickly,” Mr Szygenda says. “One reason [contractors] are co-operative is that GM spends more money than anyone else does from an IT outsourcing viewpoint.” No longer will the outsourcing companies be able to hold on to business by “playing the game”, in Mr Szygenda’s words, of setting up unique systems to lock in customers.“Does it let me switch? You bet it does,” he said. GM’s power could lead to these standard management approaches being adopted for other outsourced companies too, making it easier for everyone to manage their IT systems. Mr Szygenda clearly enjoys flexing his purchasing muscles. And he needs to. Few big companies have as little in-house support for their IT networks, yet few industries rely on IT more than the global business of making cars, with huge just-in-time supply issues and complex design systems.For GM, the 2006 contract will start the third phase of the company’s outsourcing. The first phase began on June 27, 1984 when the world’s biggest carmaker bought what was then the world’s biggest IT contractor, EDS, and handed over all its IT systems.This, GM discovered, was a mistake. “You never give it to one company,” Mr Szygenda says. He kicked off the second phase when he arrived from Bell Atlantic, the telecommunications company, in 1996, and decided to take 2,000 staff and a large chunk of the budget back in-house. “The full outsourcing was not right. I made the decision in 1996 that the accountability for IT and the management of IT would be inside. That was a monumental decision.” The decision was made easier by the sale, decided before he arrived, of EDS, which was listed on the New York stock exchange.But the sale also tied his hands. GM signed a 10-year contract with EDS before selling it, ensuring that it got the bulk of GM’s IT work, and also forcing EDS to take any work the carmaker wanted to give it. Today about a third of GM’s IT work is done by companies other than EDS, but that is expected by most observers to leap in 2006. Mr Szygenda is cautious about making predictions, saying that EDS could, in principle, increase its share of the work.But whether or not EDS gets the business, 2006 will mark a turning point for the company’s IT. The new contracts will be, because of the requirement for common processes, much easier for Mr Szygenda and his 2,000-strong IT department to manage.“You can’t have these companies using independent processes because you don’t have the time to manage that,” he said. “GM has become so complicated in digitising that when you outsource and you have three different outsourcers they use different processes to manage that environment. I don’t need three different processes.”GM has changed radically in the past five years, as Rick Wagoner, chairman and chief executive, has tried to globalise design, engineering and manufacturing systems to take advantage of potential economies of scale. That meant linking together computer-aided design systems for the 1,400 designers in 10 locations on four continents, connecting 13,500 engineers around the world so they can share components, while factories share best practice under a common production system.Much of this work has already been done. Since starting, Mr Szygenda has overseen the replacement of 24 Cad systems with one common system. The bill of materials, or list of parts, has been put into a single database, allowing purchasing managers to save money by ordering in bulk.The engineers and designers still need to be convinced to share components, rather than designing them from scratch, but the IT systems are in place. If the engineers can be made to change their mindset, the company will be able to keep reducing the time it takes to design a new car from the 45 months - when Mr Szygenda started - to close to the 12 to 24 month standard set by Japan’s Nissan and Toyota.However, the regionalised outsourcing contracts could create problems as engineers in different countries work ever more closely together. “If we don’t restructure the IT in a more common global environment by contract we might have difficulty executing in the years ahead,” Mr Szygenda warns.“Now we have an opportunity to really optimise IT. If we don’t then three, four, five years from now IT might hold GM back, which is the opposite of what has been happening so far.” This, rather than cost saving, is the aim of phase three. But there will also be lower costs, not least in IT management, which should be far simpler with common processes.The last eight years have seen GM’s IT budget come down by $1bn a year, in spite of the heavy spending to create global communication networks. More than 4,000 separate and conflicting information systems have been taken out. “The cost of IT at GM today is probably less than it has been in 25 years,” Mr Szygenda says.This, he hopes, gives the company an advantage although it is one that is more than offset financially by GM’s enormous cost hangovers in pensions and healthcare. Mr Szygenda relishes this advantage.“We are on the third generation of outsourcing,” he points out. “A lot of companies are outsourcing for the first time in their lives and making the same mistakes GM made over the last 20 years.”BiographyEducation: received a bachelor of science degree in computer science from the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1970. Earned a master’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Texas in 1975, and completed course work for a PhD in electrical engineering.Career: before joining GM in June 1996, was vice-president and CIO at Bell Atlantic, a position he held since 1993. Previously, Szygenda spent more than two decades at Texas Instruments and was responsible for hardware and software design before holding key management positions including vice-president and CIO."

If the shares had priced at the top of the range, Archipelago would have raised $167.8m.The cut in Archipelago's offering price reflected the higher competitive threat posed by the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, some analysts said.Last week John Thain, the NYSE chief executive, announced the details of plans to expand electronic trading at the Big Board, in a so-called hybrid system of electronic and floor-based trading platforms.His announcement came less than a week after Archipelago set its filing range for its shares and noted the NYSE's plans - then unknown in full - as a competitive threat in its prospectus.“If [Archipelago] got scared at the last second, I'd venture to say it's because the hybrid system,” said Jodi Burns, a financial services analyst at Celent Communications, a consultancy.“They were fairly confident that they were going to steal New York's lunch, [but] the hybrid system is so far getting mostly favourable reviews …and Archipelago may have said they won't steal all of the NYSE's lunch, but just a snack.”Bill Cline, head of capital markets at Accenture, agreed: “You have the NYSE much more aggressively moving into electronic trading, taking on more of the characteristics of other electronic markets.”Archipelago's shares closed 2 per cent higher at $12.55 on Thursday.Mr Cline said the small increase reflected an accurate pricing of the shares and of the company's business prospects.
459;ACN;Accenture Plc;2004-08-04T20:35:21Z;A moving story minus the tears and the trauma;;Little more than a year ago newspapers were stuffed with headlines about the chaos engulfing the tax credit system of Gordon Brown, UK finance minister. A failure on the Inland Revenue's part to allow enough software testing time ahead of the chancellor's self-imposed April 2003 deadline for the latest credits to start - combined with a failure on the part of its contractor, Electronic Data Systems, to insist that it be given enough time - led to the system crashing.Hundreds of thousands of families - including some of the most vulnerable in the country - were paid late. Overpayments and underpayments totalled hundreds of millions of pounds. The consequences, a year on, are still being unwound as families renew their claims.The timing could not have been worse for EDS, the US-owned business services and information technology company which was coming to the end of its 10-year contract to run the Revenue's IT systems - a deal that generated about £4bn ($7.28bn) of business and which the National Audit Office has judged to be broadly successful.The view in most of the industry, however, was that EDS would win the renewal. It was the incumbent. It had a decade's worth of insider knowledge. The contract is one of the government's biggest.No contract this size, involving so many billions of pounds worth of business, had ever been moved in the public sector, and probably not in the private sector either. There were huge risks to continuity of service if it moved. And that risk was compounded by the fact that EDS, whose contract ran to July 1 2004, had to install another even more complex version of the tax credit software in April 2004 - even if it failed to win the new deal.A year on, however, EDS no longer runs the systems. Last December, Cap Gemini Ernst and Young, working with Fujitsu, beat the pairing of EDS and Accenture for a new 10-year deal. On July 1, the day-to-day running of the contract switched. And there has not been a headline in sight.“This shows,” says Sir Peter Gershon, the former head of the Office of Government Commerce who had a part in the final decision on the new deal, “that these big contracts can indeed be moved.”In turn, he says, that should give the government comfort that it can operate a successful market in huge, outsourced, business-transforming IT deals - something essential to its plans to modernise government and make it more efficient.According to those most closely involved, the transition worked because everyone involved realised that it was in their interests to make it work - not just the Revenue and the new contractors who had put in hours of detailed planning, but the unions and even EDS and Accenture.EDS was bitterly disappointed to lose - Sheelagh Whittaker, its head of UK government business, described the loss as “devastating” and the company's “Dunkirk”.But, Sir Peter says, EDS rapidly realised “at a very senior level” that while it might be on the losing side this time, it might be on the winning one next time in what remains a growing market - and it would itself then need a smooth handover from a rival.The Revenue had required all the contractors - not just the new rivals for the deal - to detail precisely how a transition would be handled as part of the initial bids.EDS brought in John Perham from its Australian division to manage the handover. He was, he points out, untainted by the loss of the contract. “I didn't arrive feeling resentful that we had lost it.” Success for him was getting the latest release of the tax credits software in and ensuring a smooth handover.Martin Cook, CGEY's head of the programme, says one of its earliest, most urgent tasks was to convince the 3,500 staff employed by EDS, many of whom CGEY needed, “that the company they were part of had not lost the bid because they personally had failed. They had done a lot of good work in the past 10 years. We had to convince them that the new contract was about the future, not the past - and that they were a big part of what we want to achieve. It is ‘all about the people, stupid'.”In total, about 95 per cent of EDS's staff have transferred, a proportion that Mr Cook says has helped ensure continuity while giving CGEY space to bring in its own people.It was a process that Wynne Parry a national officer of the main union involved, PCS, says was eased by constant detailed consultation with staff, and CGEY's decision to sort out very early on key issues such as pensions on transfer.Mr Perham adds that EDS resisted the natural temptation to take as much money out of the contract and put in as few resources as possible in its final six months.“I am not being holier than thou about that,” he says. EDS, he adds, wants to have “a reputation for being professional going in, and professional coming out”. But that, he notes, is in the interests not just of EDS but of the industry as a whole if it is to persuade the government to continue to sign not three- or four-year deals but the long-term business change contracts that the industry believes are essential to effect real change in the way government works.“We don't want a situation where the purchasers are feeling nervous about long-term contracts because they fear the industry will not behave well. So we think we have done some favours on behalf of the industry, not just ourselves, and not just in the IT sector,” he says.Sir Peter Gershon says: “EDS recognised, I think, that making a success of this was the beginning of their rehabilitation programme in government.”But if the apparently successful transfer suggests that the government can shift huge, complex, IT contracts without chaos resulting, Mr Cook warns against celebrating too early.The real test, he says, is not the absence of trouble - with which he is pleased - but whether his company and Fujitsu succeed in improving services to the taxpayer over coming years.“We didn't win this just to deliver the same services in the same way,” he says. “If all we have changed is the name badge on the door, it hasn't been worth it”.
460;ACN;Accenture Plc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
