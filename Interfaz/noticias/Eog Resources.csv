0;EOG;Eog Resources;2018-09-07T04:02:34Z;As Skilling leaves prison, Enron’s old businesses are thriving;Bankrupt energy group’s former chief executive has been released from prison;"As Jeffrey Skilling left a minimum security prison camp in Alabama last week — on his way to a halfway house for ex-cons — he may not have been inclined to contemplate history’s ironic reversals. If he were, though, the former chief executive of Enron would have a lot to think over.Skilling, 64, was convicted in 2006 of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the collapse of the energy company, where aggressive mark-to-market accounting inflated profits and off-balance sheet entities concealed debts. His original sentence of 24 years for 18 counts was cut to 14 years in 2013 in a deal with the US Department of Justice; he appears to have been released after serving less than 12 years on the basis of good behaviour.Skilling can only hope to adjust to life after prison as well as many of Enron’s other employees and assets adjusted to life after Enron. Two companies, EOG Resources and Kinder Morgan, that were founded by former Enron executives who bought assets from the company after its collapse, have a combined market value of $110bn. They are two of the big success stories to come out of the US shale-oil boom.Enron’s peak market capitalisation, in 2000, was $70bn.The great irony is that the EOG and Kinder Morgan companies are rooted in the very sorts of activity — the asset-heavy production and transportation of energy — that Enron, during its ascent, was keen to get clear of. Asset-light trading, dealmaking, and technology, and the vulnerability of the associated accounting standards, were the order of the day then.Enron Oil & Gas, a publicly traded oil exploration and production company since the 1980s, became the independent EOG in 1999 when Mark Papa, its chief executive, bought Enron’s controlling stake (less its operations in India and China) for $600m.The prescience of that decision became clear in the middle of the last decade, when the US shale boom came into its own and EOG invested heavily in the Permian Basin region of Texas. Its share price quadrupled between 2004 and 2009, and it expanded its operations globally. When energy prices slumped in 2014, the company became leaner and more efficient, and with prices recovering, the company’s market cap now approaches $70bn.The financial structure of Kinder Morgan has undergone multiple changes under the leadership of founder Rich Kinder, but it got its start when Mr Kinder left Enron in 1996 and, along with other investors, bought the Enron Liquids Pipelines Company for $40m. That deal was followed by the creation of various partnerships and companies which were unified under the Kinder Morgan name in 2004. The company’s market value is just under $40bn today.A third corporate descendant of Enron was the wholesale power generation company Dynegy, which acquired Enron’s core pipelines business in 2002, after Enron’s collapse. Dynegy was sold to Vistra energy for $10.7bn last year, including roughly $9bn in debt.Andrew Fastow, Enron’s former chief financial officer, was released from federal prison in 2011. He has since spoken publicly about the dangers of loopholes in accounting rules. Ken Lay, Skilling predecessor as Enron chief executive, died of a heart attack in 2006, soon after being convicted."
1;EOG;Eog Resources;2018-03-04T09:15:04Z;Boom times for US shale oil producers;Industry emerges from downturn more productive and propels spectacular output growth;"“We are in the BOOM of FRAC SAND HAULING” proclaims a job advertisement on the website Indeed.com. Dozens of companies are looking for truck drivers in west Texas to haul the sand used for hydraulic fracturing, one of the processes that has unleashed the US shale oil revolution of the past decade. The sand is mixed with water and chemicals and pumped into wells at high pressure, to open cracks in the rock through which oil can flow.Drivers in the oilfield lead a rugged existence — they might work a rotation of three weeks on, one week off, and rely on truck-stop bathrooms for washing when they are on the road — but it has its rewards. Employers are offering $100,000 per year, sometimes more, and new vacancies are opening up all the time. There have been 12 new job adverts for sand truck drivers in west Texas posted just in the past week. To rev up excitement, one has a simple message: “THE OILFIELD IS BOOMING!!!!”The drivers wanted ads are a sign of how rapidly the US oil industry is changing. Over 2010-14, US crude production put on one of the strongest bursts of growth in the history of the oil industry, but the industry became a victim of its own success as oversupply in world markets sent prices tumbling, pushing it into a downturn. Activity slumped and dozens of companies were forced into bankruptcy.The rebound in crude prices to over $60 a barrel has brought shale oil producers roaring back to life again, but the industry has not simply returned to where it was before the collapse. Geographically and technologically, it has evolved, and the companies that have survived are more capable, more efficient, and better able to survive lower crude prices.As Bill Thomas, chief executive of EOG Resources, one of the most successful shale producers, put it last week: “Our potential for financial returns, operational performance and overall capital efficiency is much better today than before the downturn.”Since 2010, as US shale production has soared, the great uncertainty has always been whether the industry was built on shaky financial foundations. Shale producers have needed constant cash inflows to finance their investment in new wells. Over the past 10 years, the 55 leading US exploration and production companies, the vanguard of the shale revolution, paid out about $230bn more in capital spending than they earned in cash from operations, covering the rest with disposals, share sales, and debt.Investors made it clear last year that they had lost patience with the poor returns from shale companies, and the flow of equity financing into the industry has slowed to a trickle. But as productivity in shale continues to rise rapidly, it is possible for companies to produce more barrels for the same investment.The reason why so many truck drivers are needed in west Texas is that oil companies have been using much more sand in hydraulic fracturing, because it holds the cracks in the rock open more effectively, allowing more oil to flow out. In 2015, shale oil producers on average used 3,300 tons of sand per well, according to Petronerds, a consultancy. By last year, that had almost doubled to 6,100 tons per well. Delivering that much sand to the well site can require 250 truck movements.Other techniques for shale production have also been refined to increase the amount of oil that can be extracted. Modern rigs can drill faster, further, and more accurately than their predecessors. The process of hydraulic fracturing is being split up into more “stages”, allowing effort to be focused more precisely on oil-bearing rocks.Innovations using the latest computing and communications technology, including remote operations, are also starting to be used more widely. Schlumberger, the oilfield services group, says that in 2014, 13 per cent of jobs it worked on at US onshore wells were supported by technical experts watching from its Houston campus. By 2017, that was up to 31 per cent.Activity has also shifted towards the more productive areas. The two regions where the shale oil industry began were the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas and the Bakken formation of North Dakota. Today it is the Permian Basin of west Texas and eastern New Mexico. The numbers of rigs drilling oil wells in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken are still well below their 2014 peaks, but in the Permian it is at a record high.The Permian is a complex formation, with layers of shale and other rocks, and multiple oil-bearing zones “stacked” on top of each other. Five years ago, companies were still drilling quite a few simple vertical wells there, punching holes into the oil-bearing layers. Today the great majority of the new wells are horizontal, running through the layers to expose a greater amount of oil-bearing rock, which makes them much more productive.“Even just since 2013-14, it’s been a huge change,” says Joseph Triepke of Infill Thinking, a research firm. “Today the Permian is busier than ever; it’s like oil was a hundred bucks again.”The result has been spectacular growth in US oil output. The US has overtaken Saudi Arabia as a crude producer, and is on course to pass Russia to become the world leader this year or next. Even the habitually cautious International Energy Agency was moved to describe the recent surge in US oil output as “colossal”, adding 846,000 barrels a day in just three months.Long-suffering investors in shale remain jumpy, alert for any indication that the industry may be faltering. Last week Houston-based Carrizo Oïl & Gas reported problems including more water than it had expected being produced along with its oil in the Permian, and a cut in the expected recovery from its wells in the Eagle Ford. Its shares dropped by 18 per cent.In the latest earnings season for the US E&P companies, there have been several such stories of disappointments and difficulties. But at the same time, many companies are predicting strong production growth and a healthy financial outlook.Concho Resources, a leading producer in the Permian, said it expected to be able to increase its production by 20 per cent per year on average out to 2020, while covering all its capital spending from its cash flows so long as oil prices stay “in the low to mid $50s”.Pioneer Natural Resources plans oil production growth in the Permian of 19-24 per cent this year, and expects to be able to cover its capital spending from cash flow with oil at $58. RSP Permian said that for 2019 and beyond it expected production growth of 30 per cent, “while generating significant free cash flow” above capital spending.Simon Flowers, chief analyst at Wood Mackenzie, argued recently that “all the stars seem aligned for Tight Oil Inc. to generate positive cash flow in 2018, two years earlier than we predicted”.Those projections might seem over-ambitious, were it not for the fact that the industry has already made remarkable progress. Year after year, production from shale wells has been increasing, indicating that productivity is still rising, according to Trisha Curtis of Petronerds.“Geologically and technically, there is plenty more running room,” she says. “I am confident they can increase productivity further.”It looks as though the only thing that could really put a brake on the industry’s growth would be another collapse in prices like the one in 2014-16.“It’s a really competitive market, and what the market encourages companies to do is to keep boosting production until it’s no longer profitable for them to do so,” says Philip Verleger, an energy economist.“If prices stay at these levels, it’s up, up and away.”"

They need not worry yet;Funny what a rising oil price does for an Opec meeting. There is less reason for skulduggery. Held as usual in the world’s spy capital — 14 American and Russian agents were exchanged on the runway of Vienna’s airport in 2010 — frankly, there was little for the oil cartel to hide this year. Production cuts proffered last year by the world’s two largest crude producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, have worked. Why tinker? Russia feared the threat from America’s shale patch if oil runs up much higher. They need not worry yet.The decision was to extend output cuts beyond March to the end of 2018. Opec will reassess in the middle of next year, setting the stage for more intrigue. Global oil inventories peaked this past summer, according to International Energy Agency data. In the US, more up-to-date figures show stocks have fallen to the lowest level for this time of year since 2014. Brent has jumped nearly a third since June.So far, so good. But what about those pesky Americans and their shale oil? Oil production hit 9.5m barrels per day in September, close to the 2015 record. Output could rise another 15 per cent by end-2018 according to Rystad Energy. Shareholders in the exploration companies have in the past happily funded this growth.Little sleuthing is required to cast doubt on that outcome, however. A peek at the presentations of US-listed oil and gas exploration and production companies, such as EOG, reveals a new-found focus on self-sustaining cash flow. Consensus estimates for the 17 largest exploration and production companies have two-thirds burning through cash this year. It looks worse once dividends are subtracted. The market seems reticent to fund output with equity or debt, so the normally go-go S&P US oil exploration index has trailed all the super-majors’s shares this year, including Chevron and Exxon.There is no hiding the fact that oil prices will need to keep rallying, probably beyond $70, before US onshore supply causes Opec problems.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Will money flow back into shale sooner? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
3;EOG;Eog Resources;2017-07-23T16:46:51Z;US oil output growth hit by lack of operators and equipment;Number of drilled but uncompleted wells rises sharply;"US oil production growth this year is on course to be significantly lower than government forecasts, as companies struggle to find the operators and equipment they need to complete the wells they have drilled, according to a new energy research firm.The steady rise in shale oil output from the US has weighed on global crude prices but the projections Kayrros, a Paris-based research firm backed by former Schlumberger chief executive Andrew Gould, suggest there may be less oil coming than expected coming on to world markets over the next few months. This would help support oil prices that have already risen about 10 per cent since the Brent benchmark dipped below $45 per barrel last month.The signs of capacity shortages are also good news for oilfield services companies such as Halliburton and Schlumberger, enabling them to raise rates after steep cuts during the industry downturn that began in 2014, but suggest the profitability of US oil and gas producers will remain under pressure.Once a shale well has been drilled it needs hydraulic fracturing or fracking and other procedures to start production. The number of drilled but uncompleted wells, often known as DUCs, in the US main shale oil and gas regions has been rising sharply this year, going from 4,944 last December to 6,031 in June, according to the US government’s Energy Information Administration.Kayross argues that the number will continue to rise, slowing the growth of US oil output. By October, the firm sees onshore US production in the lower 48 states growing by 560,000 barrels per day from the end of last year to 7.09m, compared to the 900,000 b/d increase forecast by the EIA.Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrros, said: “The fracking industry is taking time to ramp up; there are not enough crews available to complete all the wells that have been drilled.”Activity in the US shale industry has been recovering for more than a year, even though companies have in aggregate been unable to cover their capital expenditures from operating cash flows at present oil and gas prices.The number of wells being drilled in the US has more than doubled, from 2,168 in the second quarter of 2016 to 4,433 in the equivalent period of this year, according to S&P Global PlattsRigData.As the recovery continues, capacity constraints have started to emerge. Brad Handler, an analyst at Jefferies, estimated that if all the wells being drilled in the US were to be brought into production promptly, they would need about 14m horsepower of pump capacity for the fracking to complete them, and the industry actually had only about 12m horsepower of active capacity. He said prices for fracking services had nearly doubled from their lows a year ago, although they were still below their peak in 2014.Patrick Schorn, vice-president for new ventures at Schlumberger, the oilfield services group, said on a call with analysts on Friday that its revenues from US hydraulic fracturing in the second quarter were up 68 per cent from the first quarter, and its capacity was already fully booked well into the fourth quarter.The number of rigs drilling the horizontal wells used for shale oil production last week dropped for a second week in succession, the first such fall since May 2016, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group, in a sign that financial pressures and the decline in crude prices between April and June may have constrained activity.Nevertheless, the larger exploration and production companies including EOG Resources, Hess, Pioneer Natural Resources and Marathon Oil have been saying that their “2017 plans are more or less set at this point”, Paul Sankey, an analyst at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note earlier this month.Some analysts believe that the capacity constraints will ease by the start of next year. Mr Rostand said that DUCs would be available to be brought into production in the future, but their contribution could be offset by a slowdown in activity and declining drilling productivity."
4;EOG;Eog Resources;2017-05-09T13:14:14Z;US shale groups roar back to life after oil slump;Biggest risk for sector is increased output causing new crude price crash;Members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet have a new catchphrase for how they see the future role of the US: not just “energy-independent”, but “energy-dominant”. As Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, put it at an industry conference in Houston last week: “Dominance is what America needs.”It would be tempting to dismiss that talk as hype, except that every week the US energy sector is coming up with evidence to justify that ambition. The latest round of earnings reports from US exploration and production companies, the leaders of the shale revolution, has shown fresh evidence of their resilience and growth potential.The resurgence of the US shale industry after the oil slump of 2014 was a key factor in how crude prices fell sharply last week, to back below $50 per barrel. The market is concerned about whether efforts by Opec, the producers’ cartel, to tackle a supply glut by curbing output will be undermined by reinvigorated US shale companies.These companies are proving that they are able not just to stay in business, but increase production as well, with oil prices close to today’s levels of about $47 per barrel for benchmark US crude.The great weakness of the shale industry has always been that the companies have typically not generated enough cash to pay for their capital spending, and have relied on debt and equity sales to finance their growth. But producers have typically cut their costs by about 40 per cent in the past three years, and many are now at or close to the point where they are covering their spending from operating cash flows.Before the oil crash of 2014, Harold Hamm, the billionaire majority owner and chief executive of Continental Resources, used to say that prices below $70 per barrel could not be sustained for any length of time, because neither Saudi Arabia nor the US shale industry could bear it.Now Continental is planning for 20 per cent annual production growth financed by its own cash flows with oil at $50 to $55, and says it can invest enough to keep output stable even with crude in the low $40s.Mr Hamm told analysts on a call last week: “The United States has retaken its place as a world energy leader, and we will compete effectively in this new regime.”Across the shale industry, drilling activity is increasing even faster than it did in the final stages of its first boom, up until 2014.The number of active rigs in the US drilling the horizontal wells used for shale oil production has more than doubled over the past 12 months, from 248 to 598 last week, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group. In the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the red-hot heart of the new boom, the number of rigs running has already hit the levels that were expected for next year, says Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie, the research firm.“We thought activity was coming back, but it surprised us that it happened so quickly,” he adds. “I don’t think anybody expected that.”Several companies have suggested the pace at which they are adding rigs would slow down.Jack Harper, chief financial officer of Concho Resources, which operates in the Permian, said that while the company’s plans showed a rising number of rigs in use in the next three years, “it doesn’t move up in a hugely dramatic fashion”.However, as companies build up experience working in shale, the wells can be drilled faster and each is on average more productive. This month 662 barrels per day will be produced from new wells in the Permian for every rig that is running there, according to the US government’s Energy Information Administration. That is triple the rate of 217b/d per rig at the end of 2014.Jamie Webster of the BCG Center for Energy Impact says that on average across the shale industry, each additional rig coming back into service can be expected to result in 2.5 times as much oil as when activity started to drop off in the autumn of 2014.As a result, many shale producers are predicting production growth this year. Pioneer Natural Resources is the star performer, forecasting growth of 15 to 18 per cent for 2017, and an annual average of at least 15 per cent out to 2026, but many others have projected solid increases.For example, Marathon Oil thinks that between 2017 and 2021 it can achieve 10 to 12 per cent annual growth, excluding its troubled operations in Libya, with US crude at $55.Not every US exploration and production company is expecting short-term growth, but enough are predicting expansion to support the EIA’s forecast that US oil output will hit a record above 10m b/d next year.So far, there are few signs that the recovery in the industry is stoking cost inflation that would stop the increased production being translated into higher earnings. EOG Resources, one of the largest shale producers, said on Monday that even though suppliers’ charges were rising, it had cut the cost of drilling and completing wells by 6 per cent in the first quarter compared to the average for 2016, through improved efficiency and signing new service contracts at lower prices.It seems right now that the greatest threat to the US shale industry is its own success. Adam Sieminski, a former head of the EIA now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank, draws an analogy with the Tragedy of the Commons. Rapid growth that is rational for the individual producer could turn out to be collectively disastrous by flooding the market.“One sheep eating the grass on the commons works,” he says. “But an entire flock soon turns the grass into mud. You overwhelm the system. Who is going to buy all that light [US shale] oil globally? Is there a market for it?”A slide from a ConocoPhillips presentation given to a conference in January is headlined rather plaintively: “Permian: We have a shiny object, too.” The message is that assets in the Permian Basin are all investors want to hear about at the moment, and Conoco’s operations there have been unfairly neglected.It is the Permian that has been the strongest the US shale oil regions in terms of crude production.From peak levels in the first half of 2015, output in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas has declined 29 per cent, according to the EIA, while in the Bakken formation of North Dakota it is down 17 per cent. By contrast in the Permian, production is at record highs, up 19 per cent in the past year alone.This boom has been matched by steep rises in the share prices of some of the companies that focus on the Permian.Since the start of 2016, the shares of Concho Resources are up 41 per cent, Diamondback Energy 50 per cent, and Parsley Energy 74 per cent. Over the same period, Conoco’s stock has risen 1 per cent.Shale oil development in the Permian was slower to get going than in the Eagle Ford or the Bakken, and companies have been experimenting with production techniques to maximise output.One of those advances is that companies are using higher volumes of sand in hydraulic fracturing or “fracking”: the pumping of fluid into a well to crack the rock so that oil can flow out.Pioneer Natural Resources said last week that in the Permian it was experimenting with using 3,000lbs of sand per foot of well, instead of 2,500. A single well could use more than 12,000 tonnes of sand.Productivity gains resulting from improved techniques mean that although the Permian needs $55 per barrel oil to be fully developed, there are areas that can be profitable with prices down in the mid-$30s, according to Wood Mackenzie, making it the lowest-cost region for crude production anywhere in the “Lower 48” states of the US.
5;EOG;Eog Resources;2017-01-12T04:01:39Z;US shale oil output remains resilient despite rig count fall;Increasing productivity will be closely watched by Opec and other oil exporters;"When US shale oil production was still rocketing higher in 2013, about 1,400 rigs were drilling wells. The average horizontal well was 6,200ft long and was pumped full of 106,000 barrels of fracking fluid and 4.4m pounds of sand and other materials to coax crude out of stubborn rocks, according to Rystad Energy, a consultancy. Today, after a devastating oil rout, the number of rigs has fallen to 529. But horizontal wells average 7,100ft long and are flooded with 226,000 barrels of fluid and 9.2m lb of “proppants” such as sand, Rystad says. One result has been a stunning rise in output from the average US oil well. The total volumes have been significant enough to alter the world supply picture. This week the US government reversed its forecast of a decline in US crude output in 2017 and called for an increase. “The upward revision largely reflects assumptions of higher drilling activity, drilling efficiency, and well-level productivity than assumed in previous forecasts,” says the short-term energy outlook of the Energy Information Administration. Increasing productivity will be closely watched in Riyadh, Baghdad, Moscow and other capitals of oil exporters that have agreed to begin limiting output to boost prices this month. US shale producers are not party to the agreement and could undermine the exporters’ strategy by raising output. Oil watchers obsess over the “rig count” statistics released each Friday by Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company. The tally is a good indication of oil companies’ intentions to expand supply. The 529 rigs now deployed are 213 more than the low in May and currently top the sum in the field a year ago, reflecting producers’ response to a modest rebound in crude prices to more than $50 a barrel. But the rig count is only part of the picture. While the number of US oil rigs is two-thirds less than the peak in October 2014, the EIA estimates that US onshore crude oil production has shrunk only 6 per cent.Rigs are the towering steel machines that drill oil wells. With the advent of horizontal drilling techniques, the drill bit makes a 90-degree turn underground to bore sideways through deep strata of shale. The hole is then pumped full of water, chemicals and sand to break up rocks and release gas and oil, a processing known as hydraulic fracturing. Rigs are moved to new well sites once the oil flows. One measure of productivity is known as estimated ultimate recovery (EUR), or the total amount of hydrocarbon extracted from a single well. In 2016, the EUR of the average US horizontal shale oil well was 736,000 barrels of oil equivalent, more than double the volumes of four years ago, according to Rystad. Another factor is efficiency — a priority for oil companies trying to break even with lower oil prices. In core areas of the Permian and Eagle Ford basins of Texas, the amount of crude produced per foot of pipe in the ground has risen between 70-120 per cent from 2012 to 2016, with further gains to come in 2017, according to consultants Wood Mackenzie. Productivity has increased for several reasons. One is technological. Horizontal oil wells have become longer, meaning a single rig can locate more oil. Oil companies have experimented by jamming more sand and fluid into the wellbore. Average drilling times have fallen from 29 days to 20 days since 2013 as rigs become faster, Rystad figures show. EOG Resources, an exploration and production company, in September completed a well in the Eagle Ford shale loaded with an “extreme” 18m lb of sand and other proppant, says Artem Abramov, Rystad vice-president of analysis. The company has roughly doubled its EUR per well in the Delaware basin of Texas and New Mexico over the past year. —————–Oil must-reads● Oil companies prepare to ramp up investment again
● Junk energy bonds premium eroded as oil price surges
● Oil in retreat towards $55 as bullish bets stall
● Opec’s long-term aim is to run down excess stocks—————–“For EOG, I guess I’m confident that we’ll continue to see improvements in productivity,” Lloyd Helms, the company’s executive vice-president for exploration and production, told analysts in November. He described the company as “like a big laboratory. They’re always tweaking knobs.” Another cause of better productivity is geological. Pressured by low prices, oil companies have narrowed their drilling campaigns to the most prolific, profitable land. They jettisoned second-rate rigs and work crews. This raised average performance. “We’re drilling all the best, tier-one rigs right now on the best acreage,” says Dave Anderson, oilfield services analyst at Barclays. “On top of that you have the best service quality you’re ever going to see. It’s the best of the best.” As higher oil prices spur oil companies to start spending again, less efficient rigs will return to less desirable acreage, delivering less new oil per well. “The treadmill of productivity gains becomes tougher to stay on as you ramp the rig count up,” says Ben Shattuck, US upstream analyst at Wood Mackenzie. Yet the best rigs will remain, more productive than before. "
6;EOG;Eog Resources;2016-09-29T05:04:31Z;Opec output cut a boon for US shale sector;The higher prices rises, the more rigs can be put back to work, writes Ed Crooks;The tentative agreement for Opec to cut its production is the best news the world’s oil producers have had all year. When ministers from the oil cartel announced in Algiers on Wednesday evening that they had agreed a production target lower than their current output, they signalled they were prepared to make sacrifices to ease the global crude glut, which will help all producers. They also implicitly admitted they might open gaps in world oil markets that others could fill.The details have been put off until the next Opec meeting at the end of November. A “high-level committee” will be appointed to look at how the proposed cut should be shared out between member countries — the question that is always the hardest in any cartel. Even so, there was an immediate reaction in the markets to the news: Brent crude rose by 6 per cent on Wednesday evening to about $49 per barrel.The celebrations will be loudest in the boardrooms of Houston and Oklahoma City. The US shale oil industry has been in retreat for most of the past two years but it has started to turn the corner. Since May the number of rigs drilling for oil in the US has been rising. Companies that had been outspending their cash flows for years have been bringing their finances under control thanks to cost cuts and productivity gains.If oil prices can hang on to their recent gains, American shale producers will be able to accelerate their recovery, putting more rigs back to work and bringing more wells into production.The best US shale wells can deliver acceptable returns even with crude below $20 per barrel, according to Wood Mackenzie, the research company. In the Permian Basin of west Texas there are fields that on average need an oil price of only about $40 per barrel. But the move from $40 to $50 makes a big difference.Chevron, one of the largest US oil groups, said this month that at $40 oil it could drill about 1,300 profitable wells in the Permian region, but at $50 it could drill 4,000 such wells.EOG Resources, a company that was a pioneer of the shale oil revolution, said last month that with oil at $50-$60 per barrel, it could increase its production by 10-20 per cent every year. Not every shale producer is as well-positioned for growth as EOG.US oil production is in decline because of the slowdown in drilling that began in 2014, and it is likely to keep falling into next year. But the higher prices rise, the more American companies will be able to put rigs back to work, and the more likely it is that US production will start to recover.American crude could both take market share from Opec and put a limit on oil price rises by bringing additional supply on to the market.American crude could both take market share from Opec and put a limit on oil price risesThat is the central problem for Saudi Arabia, Opec’s de facto leader, and the other members of the cartel: the same problem they have faced since US shale oil became a significant force in world markets.In 2014, Opec’s members had a choice. They could cut their production, helping to support prices but losing market share to the US. Or they could let the oil glut grow and prices plunge, in the hope that investment in higher-cost sources of supply, including US shale, would be choked off.For two years, the Saudis have chosen to let prices go, and the results have been painful for Opec’s members. Now, apparently, they are prepared to try a more interventionist policy. But for as long as US shale oil remains viable, the results are unlikely to be much happier for Opec.The writer is the FT’s US energy editor
7;EOG;Eog Resources;2016-09-11T17:08:13Z;The region leading the US oil recovery;Permian basin in Texas is proving resilient following crude price crash;In the property business, it is often said that only three factors really matter: location, location, and location. Much the same is true in the oil business.In the tentative upturn in the US shale oil industry since May, most of the additional drilling and much of the acquisition spending has been focused on one hotspot: the Permian basin of western Texas and eastern New Mexico.This formation, about 300 miles long and 250 miles wide, holds some of North America’s most accessible shale oil reserves. Companies that have been lucky enough, or smart enough, to build strong positions there — such as Pioneer Natural Resources and Concho Resources — can expect to have a competitive advantage over other oil producers, in what remains a very difficult market.As share prices of US exploration and production companies have rebounded this year, those focused on the Permian have been the best performers. Shares in Diamondback Energy and RSP Permian, for example, have been hitting record highs, up 48 per cent and 66 per cent respectively over the past 12 months.Even ExxonMobil and Chevron — the two largest US oil groups, which were left behind by smaller, more innovative rivals as the shale boom took off — now have opportunities in the Permian to make up some lost ground.Although the Permian was not immune as activity across the US oil industry slumped after the crude price crash of two years ago, it has proved the most resilient of the “big three” US shale regions. From peak production, crude output has dropped by 40 per cent in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas, and by 25 per cent in the Bakken formation centred on North Dakota. In the Permian, by contrast, the drop is only 2 per cent.In a sign of the region’s attractions, EOG Resources, one of the most successful of the independent US shale producers, last week announced a $2.5bn deal to buy privately-held Yates Petroleum. Yates’ most valuable assets are drilling rights on 324,000 acres of the Permian.EOG pioneered oil development in the Eagle Ford, and it is still the largest producer there. But William Thomas, EOG’s chief executive, told analysts on a call last month that it would spend 45 per cent of next year’s capital budget in the Delaware, a sub-basin on the western side of the Permian.Since May, the number of rigs drilling horizontal shale oil wells in the US has risen by 77 to 325, according to the oilfield services company Baker Hughes. Of those, 49 were added in the Permian, compared with just four in the Eagle Ford and six in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken.At the same time, the Permian has been a focus for deals. Of the $30.4bn spent on mergers and acquisitions in the US exploration and production sector so far this year, 48 per cent has gone to the Permian, according to research company Wood Mackenzie.Companies have been attracted to the Permian because it holds some of the lowest-cost oil in North America.Production costs can vary widely within each area, and the best spots in the Eagle Ford and Bakken are still competitive but overall the Permian has the most attractive economics. At current crude prices, bringing a well in the Delaware basin into production will generate an internal rate of return of about 18 per cent on average, according to Platts Analytics. That is higher than for any other shale region.Coming relatively late to the shale party, behind the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, the Permian has offered greater scope for companies to cut costs and raise production. Since 2012, average peak output per well has risen by 122 per cent in the Permian, compared with 67 per cent in the Eagle Ford and 78 per cent in the Bakken, according to data analysis firm NavPort.Meanwhile, costs are falling sharply. Concho Resources told investors at a Barclays conference last week that it had cut the cost per foot of its wells by about 40 per cent since the first quarter of 2015.Long-term prospects for the region were also underlined last week when Apache, the US exploration and production company, announced the discovery of a “significant new resource play” in the Permian, which could hold more than 3bn barrels of oil and 75tn cubic feet of gas, in a part of a formation that had been neglected by other companies.Geologists sometimes describe the Permian as a “layer cake” of multiple different oil-bearing formations, with names such as Wolfcamp, Spraberry and Bone Spring. Companies are experimenting with techniques to optimise production from as many of these layers as possible.Exploration in the Permian has a long history, with the first oil struck in 1923, and west Texas has experienced several cycles of boom and bust. Drilling rights are often held by smaller companies that are prepared to sell out, giving larger operators a chance to build positions. That also opens the door for private equity investors such as Blackstone, which last month committed $1.5bn to two oil producers to buy Permian assets.Exxon and Chevron also see great potential in the region. Exxon came into the Permian through its takeover of XTO Energy in 2010, and added on subsequent smaller acquisitions, while Chevron has a large legacy position. But they see similarly bright prospects.Exxon said last month that it had cut unit development costs on the Permian by 70 per cent over the past two years, and “a large part” of the inventory of wells it could drill would be economically viable with crude at about $40 a barrel.Chevron said it had cut unit development costs by 30 per cent since last year, and raised production by 24,000 barrels per day. It was using six rigs there last month, and plans to raise that to 10 by the end of the year.Heightened levels of M&A activity suggest other companies will add more rigs, too, even if the oil price remains at its present level of about $45 for US crude. “You don’t typically do a billion-dollar deal and then wait for market conditions to improve,” points out Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie. “You get rigs in the field.”On that basis, the Permian seems set to remain a hot location for a long time to come.While the Permian Basin of west Texas has become the focus for much of the US shale industry, other areas are also attracting increased activity, writes Ed Crooks.Of these, the most popular has been the “Stack”: a rather laboured acronym for the “Sooner Trend Anadarko basin Canadian and Kingfisher counties”, in Oklahoma.In those two counties, to the west of Oklahoma City, the number of rigs drilling horizontal shale oil wells has risen from 13 in July to 20 today. That is a faster increase than in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas or the Bakken formation of North Dakota, the original heartlands of the US shale oil boom.Activity is now set to pick up further. At the Barclays energy conference in New York last week, seven companies including Marathon Oil, Cimarex and Devon Energy highlighted their position in the Stack as an important prospect for future growth.Lee Tillman, Marathon’s chief executive, described the Stack as the group’s “first priority in the capital allocation process.” In June, Marathon agreed a deal to pay $888m for PayRock Energy, a private equity-backed company with drilling rights over 61,000 acres of the Stack.Similarly, in December, Devon Energy agreed to pay $1.9bn for 80,000 acres in the Stack from Felix Energy. Last week, Devon reported that it had already gone from running two rigs to four in the Stack, and was planning to bring on two more by the end of the year.David Hager, Devon’s chief executive, said results from its pilot wells had been “outstanding”, and the company was “very excited” about its prospects in the region.

The telecoms and utilities sectors rallied 0.9 per cent and 1.1 per cent, respectively.The two sectors were the worst performers on the S&P 500 last month as the spectre of higher interest rates weakened their allure.NRG Energy, a power group, rose 1.4 per cent to $12.15 as blue-chip telecoms Verizon Communications climbed 1.2 per cent to $53.51.Elsewhere, Spectra Energy led the S&P 500 energy sector higher.Enbridge of Canada on Tuesday said it would acquire the group for about $28bn in a deal that would create the largest oil and gas pipeline company in North America.Spectra rallied 13.4 per cent to $41 on Tuesday. Other groups in the sector were in the black as well: EOG Resources, an exploration and production company, rose 6.7 per cent to $94.83, while ExxonMobil, the biggest US energy company, climbed 1.3 per cent to $88.57.At the close, the S&P 500 had advanced 0.3 per cent to 2,186.5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by the same margin to 18,538.1, and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.5 per cent to 5,275.9.

10;EOG;Eog Resources;2016-08-28T16:27:59Z;Cost reductions help US shale oil industry pass first real test;Companies respond to price plunge with dramatic cost-cutting;The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote, “That which does not kill me makes me stronger.” It could be the motto of the US shale industry.Ever since the shale boom started, there have been critics arguing that it was all too good to be true. Sceptical analysts warned that the industry would collapse like a house of cards if oil and gas prices fell.This summer has brought the strongest evidence yet that they were wrong. Since prices began to fall two years ago, some shale producers have wilted, and dozens have folded. Many others, however, have been tempered by adversity. The second-quarter earnings statements from US exploration and production companies earlier this month showed some remarkable cost reduction numbers — not aspirations, but achieved results. Pioneer Natural Resources said it had reduced its production cost per barrel by 26 per cent since last year. Devon Energy said costs were down 40 per cent from their peak.Some of the fall came from lower prices in the supply chain. Pioneer’s contracts for steel tubes and cement ran out last year, and its new contracts cost 30-35 per cent less.Other cost reductions arose from internal innovations in well design, drilling and completions. EOG Resources, for example, is saving money by running drilling and cementing operations on multiple wells at the same site simultaneously. Continental Resources said it had cut the time needed to drill a well in the “Stack” shale oil area of Oklahoma by 44 per cent since last year.The cost cuts achieved by driving down suppliers’s rates could be reversed in a recovery, as staff, rigs and pumps for hydraulic fracturing are put back to work. Dave Lesar, chief executive of Halliburton, the oilfield services group, argued last month that its businesses serving US shale producers “will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages”.But savings achieved through efficiency gains will be permanent. Vicki Hollub, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, told analysts that about 80 per cent of its savings in the Permian Basin of west Texas came from improved well design and drilling techniques, lower materials costs and enhanced logistics.The savings mean that US shale reserves, which a few years ago were in the upper-middle section of the global cost curve, now include some of the world’s lowest-cost sources of new oil, according to Wood Mackenzie, the research company.Meanwhile, the view that shale production will always need a sustained inflow of capital is fading, as companies cut spending to live within their means. In the second quarter, 58 leading E&P companies covered by Bloomberg reported total capital spending that was just $2.7bn greater than their operating cash flow, compared to a $9.7bn deficit in the equivalent period of 2015.Falling costs have made it possible for activity to rise even as spending has shrunk. As Mr Lesar puts it, the industry is “getting back to business”.Last week there were 316 rigs drilling the horizontal wells used for shale oil, up 68 from the low point in May, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group.This increase has come even though US crude has never been above $52 per barrel though that time, and at one point was below $40.In 2015, the recovery in rig use had a false start. It got going when US crude was about $60 per barrel and evaporated as oil slipped lower in the second half of that year. The cost cutting done since then means that this year’s upturn is more likely to be sustained.The pressure on costs and capital spending remains intense. US crude production dropped by 800,000 barrels per day between April 2015 and May 2016, and is still in decline. Companies including Marathon and Continental have indicated that US crude needs to recover to about $60 before they would be happy to make the investments they need to increase production. Pioneer and EOG, which are projecting robust growth at prices around $50, are unusual.However, the fall in US oil output is now gentler than seemed likely in the spring. Some companies, including ConocoPhillips, Continental and Pioneer, have even raised their guidance for expected production.The shale oil industry, born at the end of the last decade, has still not yet been through a complete cycle of rise, fall and recovery. With no precedents, there was inevitably uncertainty about how it would respond, and that has not been dispelled completely. But the industry has now faced its first real test. So far, it is passing.ed.crooks@ft.com
11;EOG;Eog Resources;2016-07-26T04:00:45Z;Dismal delivery puts big oil and gas energy projects at risk;The majors can no longer afford delays or cost overruns on ‘megaprojects’;Oil companies have tens of thousands of employees, tens of billions of dollars in reserves, and decades of experience in running large investment projects.Yet time and again big oil companies prove themselves incapable of completing their projects on time and on budget.In 2009 Chevron’s Gorgon, a liquefied natural gas project in north-west Australia, was expected to cost $37bn and start production in 2014. It has ended up costing about $54bn and came on stream this year. Soon after it started, it suffered a gas leak that meant production had to be shut down.Kashagan, a $50bn oil development in the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan, took nine years to move into production after it was given the go-ahead in 2004.Within weeks of celebrating first oil, the international consortium running the project was forced to shut it down after corrosive gas was discovered to be leaking from pipelines.Royal Dutch Shell, one of the companies in the consortium running the project said in March that the group expected to restart production around the end of 2016.Those are far from isolated occurrences. A study of 365 oil and gas “megaprojects” by Ernst & Young, the professional services firm, found 64 per cent faced cost overruns and 73 per cent were behind schedule.Of the 20 largest, only seven were being delivered in line with the budget approved when the final investment decision was taken. Three were running 75-100 per cent over their initial budget, and the average cost overrun was 23 per cent.Analysis published in June by McKinsey, the management consultancy, showed eight recent large oil and gas projects had ended up costing more than twice as much as originally estimated.“The industry has got a real problem,” says Chris Pateman-Jones of Ernst & Young. “Projects are becoming larger and more complex and more challenging . . . Even if they were to hit their targets, they could still be uneconomic.”Such analysis illustrates the quandary facing the oil majors such as BP and Chevron, challenged by the boom in shale oil and gas production from their smaller, nimbler rivals in North America and by state-controlled rivals in resource-rich countries. Their fortunes are also threatened by policies to cut carbon dioxide emissions that are curbing demand for fossil fuels.Yet with oil prices low and capital spending plans slashed, the prices of oil services and equipment are falling. So, this could be a good time to start spending on projects that will come into production as oil prices recover.But such a strategy will only pay off if those projects are completed efficiently. “To reap the benefits of investing in these large projects at the bottom of the cycle, it’s critical that the operators deliver them on time and on budget,” says Angus Rodger of Wood Mackenzie, the research company. “The industry’s recent record at delivering major projects has been dismal, so that needs to improve.”Even before the oil price crash of 2014, large developments were falling out of favour because of rising costs and declining profits across the sector. In 2007-13 there were about 40 large projects approved by the oil and gas industry worldwide each year, Mr Rodger says. Last year there were just eight, and this year there are likely to be about 10.Chevron has signalled a shift away from large projects towards smaller investments, including in shale in North America.But even those that do have shale reserves find it hard to compete with their smaller, more agile rivals such Devon Energy and EOG Resources, which have made all the running in the industry. In shale, bigger is not better.If projects cannot be made more efficient, they may never get off the ground.For big oil companies, projects such as deepwater oilfields or liquefied natural gas plants will continue to be critical to their future.There are steps that they can take to improve the economics of those investments, some of them learned from other industries.One is to use new technologies to cut costs. 3D printing, for example, can reduce the need for large inventories of parts to be kept or delivered to projects that are often in remote locations. Another is better contract design that gives suppliers an incentive to hold down costs.“The history of the industry is that there has been an adversarial relationship between operators and contractors not because they are bad people, but because the business incentives set it up that way,” Mr Pateman-Jones says. “I think we will move to much more effective ways of delivering projects.”If projects cannot be made more efficient, he adds, then they may never get off the ground. “If I were investing in some of these really big projects, I would be questioning whether they really made sense over a long period of time.”

Among the top performers was Williams Companies, an energy infrastructure group, which rallied 6.9 per cent to $20.57. EOG Resources, a large oil exploration and production company, rose 2.4 per cent to $81.26.Chevron, the second-biggest US energy group, rose 0.8 per cent to $101.42.Chesapeake Energy also rose after the second-biggest US natural gas driller narrowed its quarterly loss.It reported a net loss of $921m, or $1.44 a share, for the quarter to the end of March. That is down from a loss of $3.74bn, or $5.72 a share, a year earlier and in line with market expectations.Chesapeake also sought to quell investors’ concerns over its debt pile, which stood at $9.4bn at the end of March — or more than twice the company’s market capitalisation of $4bn.The company said on Thursday it was selling a portion of its holdings in an oil-soaked patch of shale in northern Oklahoma known as the Stack to Newfield Exploration for $470m. The sale comes on top of $700m of asset disposals announced in late February.The sale should give a boost to Chesapeake’s liquidity position. The company ended the quarter with just $16m in cash compared with $2.9bn at the end of March of last year.Chesapeake’s stock traded as high as $6.47 a share at the opening of the market before paring back its gains to trade 1.1 per cent higher at $5.71.The energy sector has risen 9 per cent in 2016, making it one of the year’s top performers, as the price of oil has surged almost three-quarters since mid-February.West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, gained 1.2 per cent to $44.23 a barrel on Thursday with the international marker Brent rising 0.9 per cent to $45.01.The rally was sparked by a wildfire that struck around Fort McMurray, Canada’s oil sands hub.“More production and pipeline capacity is being shutdown” as a result of the fire, said Olivier Jakob, managing director at Switzerland-based energy consultancy Petromatrix, who reckons the supply disruption could reach 1m barrels a day.Elsewhere, L Brands shares tumbled after the owner of Victoria’s Secret said it expected to post quarterly profits that are weaker than Wall Street estimates.The Ohio-based company said it expected adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings per share “at the high end of its previous guidance of $0.50 to $0.55”. Analysts expected profits of $0.58 a share.The group has been under pressure since February when it announced the departure of Sharen Jester Turney, chief executive of Victoria’s Secret, L Brands’ biggest unit. Its shares dropped 12 per cent to $70.53 on Thursday and have plummeted more than 26 per cent this year.At the close, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat at 2,050.6 and 17,660.7, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.2 per cent to 4,717.1.

The Russell 2000 energy sector tumbled 3.4 per cent before rebounding to a gain of 2 per cent.Oasis Petroleum, an E&P group, having traded lower earlier in the day, ended 0.9 per cent higher at $8.71.Big global oil producers, including Opec leader Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, were expected to agree on Sunday to freeze production at January levels as they looked to stabilise oil markets amid sustained low oil prices.However, the meeting ended in disarray after Saudi Arabia took a tougher stance with Iran, which has sought to increase production after its international sanctions were lifted in January.“A resurging market share battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran . . . casts a veil over the timing of the realignment of supply and demand” in the energy market, said Michael Scialla, an analyst at Stifel, who advised clients to “stay on defence” regarding US E&P companies.West Texas Intermediate, the US crude oil marker, traded down 1.4 per cent to $39.78 a barrel, having fallen nearly 7 per cent in Asia trading.Elsewhere, Hasbro rallied after posting a jump in quarterly profits and sales as the toymaker benefited from strong demand for Star Wars-related toys, rising 5.8 per cent to $87.18.Profits rose to $48.8m, or 38 cents a share, in the first quarter, from $26.7m, or 21 cents a share, in the same period in 2015.Sales climbed 16 per cent to $831.2m. Wall Street analysts forecast earnings of 24 cents a share on sales of $779.3m.The group is also “very encouraged with global demand and our outlook for 2016”, said Brian Goldner, chief executive.That came as good news since concerns have grown in recent months about the state of the world economy. The International Monetary Fund this month reduced its forecast for world economic growth in 2016 by 0.2 percentage points to 3.2 per cent.At the close, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,094.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 18,004.2 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4 per cent to 4,960.Every main S&P 500 sector was in the black. Energy and consumer discretionary stocks posted the biggest gains.In addition to the focus on oil, investors were also bracing for a number of quarterly earnings reports and a European Central Bank meeting this week.

EOG Resources shed a loss of 2.6 per cent to rise 0.6 per cent to $76.13.Small cap energy companies, which are generally seen as more susceptible to fluctuations in the oil price since they frequently have relatively weaker balance sheets, fluctuated in a wider range. The Russell 2000 energy sector tumbled 3.4 per cent, before cutting its losses to only 0.3 per cent.Oasis Petroleum, an E&P group, is trading 4.5 per cent lower at $8.24, having tumbled by as much as 9 per cent earlier. Atwood Oceanics, an offshore rig contractor, was down by roughly the same margin at $8.67.Major global oil producers, including Opec kingpin Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, were expected to agree on Sunday to freeze production at January levels as they look to stabilise oil markets amid a sustained period of low oil prices. However, the meeting ended in disarray after Saudi Arabia took a tougher stance with Iran, which has sought to increase production after sanctions were lifted recently on the Middle Eastern nation.West Texas Intermediate, the US crude oil marker, recently traded down by 2.5 per cent to $39.34 a barrel, having fallen nearly 7 per cent in Asia trading.

However, the decline was shallower than many analysts predicted.While all of the biggest lenders put more money aside to bolster their defences against potential loan losses from the energy sector, executives suggested the trouble was isolated to a relatively small portion of the market and that exposure remained manageable.JPMorgan was up 7.2 per cent on the week at $61.88, BofA climbed 8.6 per cent to $13.99, Wells advanced 2.5 per cent to $48.25 and Citi jumped 11 per cent to $44.94.The financials sector more broadly was up 4 per cent on the week, its best performance since the week of March 4.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the two biggest US investment banks, are set to post their first-quarter results next week, along with 99 other companies listed on the S&P 500.Elsewhere, Bats Global Markets, a US exchange operator, made its public debut on Friday. The Kansas-based company’s shares gained 21 per cent to $23, after pricing its initial public offering at $19 a share on Thursday evening. The move came as vindication for the group after its failed IPO attempt in 2012.The shares of many energy companies declined on Friday as the price of crude oil fell for the third session in a row.The drop came as traders await a meeting this weekend of several of the world’s biggest oil producers, including Russia and Saudi Arabia. The group is expected to freeze production at January levels However, Iran, an important marginal producer, may not participate as it looks to intensify output after sanctions have been lifted.EOG Resources, a large US exploration and production group, dropped 2.7 per cent to $75.71. Kinder Morgan, an energy pipeline group, fell 1.9 per cent to $18.15.Reports that Altice, the multinational cable group controlled by serial dealmaker Patrick Drahi, is close to receiving approval for its proposed $17.7bn takeover of Cablevision sent the latter’s shares up 1.9 per cent to $33.59.Shares in Cablevision have been trading at below Altice’s all-cash offer of $34.90 since the deal was announced in September, amid concerns that the deal will not close.New York City has said it has “a number of important concerns” about the merger and believes it has the power to deny the deal if it finds it is not in the public interest. Cablevision’s 3.1m customers are concentrated in the greater New York market.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 had dipped 0.1 per cent to 2,081, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower at 17,897 and the Nasdaq Composite conceded 0.2 per cent to 4,938.

For much of the industry, though, the outlook has hardly brightened at all.The North American shale boom of the past decade was driven by real technological progress but also a rapid accumulation of debt. Now the boom has gone but the debt remains, and it will hang over the sector for many years to come.Oil and gas: Debt fears flare upRosneft runs to stand still amid oil crashSaudi Arabia loses oil market share to rivalsUS crude has risen from about $26 a barrel in February to about $37 on Monday. Over the same period, the S&P 500 exploration and production companies index has increased about 23 per cent, and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch high-yield energy bond index has risen 26 per cent.For many US oil and gas companies, however, financial pressures are still growing. Hedges that helped support revenues are being used up; banks are expected to reduce many companies’ borrowing facilities in the round of reserves revaluations now under way, and bond markets have been closed for all but the strongest groups.The rebound in oil makes a big difference to some companies and not much difference at all to many others, according to Jeff Schlegel of Jones Day, the law firm.“There are companies where the price could go to $50 and it still wouldn’t help,” he says.In mid-2014, as US oil prices began to fall from a peak of $107 a barrel, the industry had a cost structure and a debt burden that were manageable if crude stayed at about that level. Since then, production expenses have been driven down as companies have struggled to stay afloat. Productivity has kept rising, and service companies’ profit margins have been crunched.Chesapeake Energy, for example, told investors at a conference last month that it had cut the cost of drilling a well in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas from $5.9m in 2014 to an expected $4.2m this year. Every other company has a similar story.The process of restructuring the industry’s debt burden, however, is only just beginning.Steven Woods of Moody’s, the credit rating agency, says the entire US oil industry is under financial stress with prices at today’s levels.“At $40, the industry doesn’t work,” he adds. “Companies can’t earn an adequate return on capital.”Some companies, though, are more stressed than others. It is no coincidence that the four US exploration and production companies that sold bonds in the first quarter were some of the largest and most secure in the sector: Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Anadarko Petroleum and EOG Resources.There have also been 17 US oil and gas producers that have held share offers this year, raising a total of $10.6bn, the second-highest tally of any quarter on record, according to Dealogic. They were typically ones with assets that have attractive long-term potential, including Pioneer Natural Resources, with its shale position in the Permian Basin of west Texas.Those companies with access to the capital markets may be able to hang on and wait for the eventual upturn. But many do not have that option. The gulf between the stronger and the weaker companies is widening.“The longer this goes on, the more you will see companies either filing for bankruptcy or selling all their assets,” says Dewey Gonsoulin of Bracewell, the law firm.Last week brought another string of companies approaching default on their debts. SandRidge Energy, an Oklahoma-based gas producer, said it had hired advisers to look at a possible bankruptcy, and warned there was “substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern as it is currently structured”.Privately-held Chaparral Energy said it was considering bankruptcy, Ultra Petroleum missed a $26m interest payment and Goodrich Petroleum said it would enter bankruptcy as part of an agreed restructuring.Attempting to avoid the same fate, US oil and gas companies cut their capital spending by about 40 per cent last year on average, and are planning for a further 50 per cent reduction this year.The number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the US has dropped 77 per cent since September 2014, falling a further 14 last week to 450, the lowest level since the data were first collected in 1940.As a result, US oil production has started declining, too. The drop has been modest but it is expected to continue through the year. Although there are a few exploration and production companies still forecasting growth in 2016, most expect their output to fall.When the oversupply in the global oil market that has been depressing prices finally ends, and crude starts to rise again, more US production will become commercially attractive once more. A price of $60 a barrel looks like a critical level in terms of stimulating a revival in drilling. Occidental told investors recently that just 14 per cent of its potential shale well locations in the Permian Basin would be economic to drill with oil below $50 a barrel, but 40 per cent would be viable below $60.The rate at which those potentially profitable opportunities are drilled will depend on how much money companies have to spend. For now, the inflow of new capital from private equity is sluggish.Merger and acquisition activity, which could reallocate assets to companies that have the financial resources to develop them, has also been slow, dropping to its lowest quarterly level for at least a decade.Bitter experience, including the shortlived rally in crude prices in the first half of last year, has taught investors to favour caution.“Growing for growth’s sake worked in a world of $100 oil. It doesn’t work now,” says Brad Carpenter at Cantor Fitzgerald.Espen Erlingsen of Rystad Energy, a consultancy, says the guiding principle among the shale companies now is to cover their capital spending from their cash flow.To stabilise total US production and stop it falling, oil would need to be about $40 to $50 a barrel, he adds. To go back to the boom years of 2012-14, when the US was adding about 1m barrels a day of additional supply every year, oil would need to be more than $80.The shale revolution will not be reversed; in fact, the technology is continuing to advance. But every revolution needs to be followed by a period of consolidation, and this one is no different. The high-growth period of the industry’s history is over, perhaps for a long time.This is the fourth part of a Financial Times series entitled Oil: Lower for longer, looking at the consequences of the prolonged decline in crude prices."
17;EOG;Eog Resources;2016-02-24T17:51:37Z;Energy investment vehicle Silver Run rises in debut;;Silver Run Acquisition Corporation, a vehicle that plans to invest in the energy sector, climbed in its market debut on Wednesday, as investors hunt for bargains amid the wreckage left by an extended period of low oil prices.Silver Run, which is partly owned by New York-based private equity company Riverstone Holdings, rose 2.8 per cent in mid-day trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, after raising a stronger-than-expected $450m in its initial public offering, writes Adam Samson in New York.The offering represented the biggest US IPO this year, according to Bloomberg data.Silver Run said it plans to buy companies that are fundamentally sound, but have taken a hit due to the collapse in oil prices that has eaten into the bottom line of many companies that operate in the energy sector. The company said in a filing:Even fundamentally sound companies can often under-perform their potential due to a temporary period of dislocation in the markets in which they operate.The group will be led by Mark Papa, who was the chief executive of EOG Resources, one of the biggest players in the US shale revolution, from 1999 to 2013.While the market has punished energy companies recently, with the S&P 500 energy sector tumbling almost 30 per cent over the past 12 months, private equity companies such as Blackstone Group have sought to buy energy companies’ debt and equity at bargain prices.
18;EOG;Eog Resources;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Obstacles hold back US oil sector M&A;Pressure is building for deals but flow has been slower than expected;"Pressure is building for a surge in dealmaking in the energy industry — but there are several obstructions still holding it back.With Brent crude languishing at about $35 per barrel, a shake-out is looming in the oil industry worldwide, and particularly among heavily indebted US shale producers.Weak oil prices encouraged industry consolidation in the mega-merger wave at the end of the 1990s, and conditions today might seem similarly conducive to making acquisitions. To put the US shale business on a footing for a sustained recovery, there will have to be a reallocation of assets between companies. “There are companies that are very good technically but overextended themselves financially,” says Vance Scott at Ernst & Young. “The industry has to have M&A to reset its capital structure.” So far, however, the flow of deals has been slower than expected, with some of the factors behind the lack of transactions expected to linger in the future. Many oil executives believe crude prices are set to rise over the next few years, suggesting now would be a great time to buy assets that can benefit from the upturn. Jay Horine, head of North American energy investment banking at JPMorgan, argues that the companies that are in stronger financial positions “will try to take advantage of the change in oil prices” by making acquisitions. However, he adds, the timing of those moves is hard to predict. Forecasts from a year ago that there would be a surge in takeovers by the end of 2015 went unfulfilled. The number of deals agreed in the US oil and gas industry went down 30 per cent last year, according to Dealogic. Volatility in the oil price has been one obstacle. When the price is changing rapidly, and expectations about the future vary widely, it is harder for sellers and buyers to agree on valuations. Another is that the oil and gas companies’ shares still do not fully reflect the latest commodity price declines. Greg Weinberger, co-head of global M&A at Credit Suisse, says the main barrier to corporate dealmaking is that companies that have attractive assets are still trading as if oil prices were higher. Bank of America Merrill Lynch calculated earlier this month that the share prices of EOG Resources and ConocoPhillips implied an expected US crude price of $50 per barrel, the Pioneer Natural Resources share price implied oil at $55, and Occidental Petroleum’s shares implied oil at $65. Royal Dutch Shell had to work to persuade its investors that its acquisition of BG Group, which closed this week, was still worth pursuing even though oil and gas prices had fallen since the deal was agreed. Meanwhile, some sellers are reluctant to dispose of assets because of the low prices and the number of companies with strained finances simultaneously trying to make disposals to raise cash. John Watson, chief executive of Chevron, said last month it was “a terrible market to be trying to sell most assets”. Chevron is trying to raise $5bn-$10bn from asset sales in 2016-17, but Mr Watson said that if the transactions proved difficult, they would be shelved. Skip McGee, founder of the energy-focused boutique advisory firm Intrepid Partners, says companies that are not facing a financial crisis will ""try to hold on for longer, as selling in volatile times is tough"". Companies in financial distress are unlikely to be attractive takeover targets, according to Tom Watters, managing director of oil and gas at Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency. “If a company has debt trading at 30 cents on the dollar, why come in and buy it, when you have to make the creditors whole?” he says. “You’re better off waiting for it to go into bankruptcy, and buying the assets.” Asset sales can also be difficult, however, because of the time needed for buyers to evaluate possible deals. Many producers have stubbornly refused to look at asset sales while prices are low, according to Trevor Wallace of PetroMark Energy, an investment firm.Now, he says, “some have suddenly glanced up and recognised that they're about to hit the wall.” They might need to sell assets to avoid bankruptcy, but find potential buyers are unable to do their due diligence fast enough. Given time, all of these obstacles can probably be overcome.Mr McGee says that a growing number of distressed companies are warming up to the idea that they might need to sell their all or part of their operations to avoid bankruptcy. ""The mood has changed significantly,"" he says. ""With oil prices around or below $30 a barrel, it’s a whole different situation from a year ago.” Companies that have been trying to “extend the runway”, access to equity and non-investment grade debt has been cut off for most companies, and financially strained companies are running out of options. Private equity firms say they have raised tens of billions of dollars to invest in US energy, and some deals have been announced recently. Last month a large area in the Permian Basin of west Texas was bought by a new business called Luxe Energy, which is backed by private equity firm NGP Energy. If M&A activity in the US oil industry does finally start to take off, it would show that the restructuring has begun. “Because there was so much capital available, some of those guys were able to hang on much longer than they should have,” says Dennis Cassidy of AlixPartners, a consultancy. A pick-up in M&A would be “a positive sign that recovery is well on the way.”"
19;EOG;Eog Resources;2016-02-03T00:58:53Z;Standard & Poor’s cuts ratings of US oil and gas groups;Chevron hit and shale producers are downgraded to junk;Standard & Poor’s has cut the credit ratings of some leading US oil and gas companies, including Chevron, the country’s second largest, as a result of the agency’s lowered expectations for long-term crude prices.The decisions show how the plunge in oil and gas since the summer of 2014 is hitting not only the highly indebted exploration and production companies that borrowed to finance their growth during the US shale boom, but also the more financially conservative independent companies and even the large international oil groups Chevron and ExxonMobil. Three leading shale oil and gas producers, Continental Resources, Southwestern Energy and privately held Hunt Oil, were downgraded from investment grade to “junk” status. Exxon, the largest US oil group and one of only three companies in the country with an AAA status, was put on watch for a possible downgrade of the rating. S&P said it would decide on Exxon within 90 days.The moves follow the agency’s announcement last month that it would be using lowered long-term oil and gas price expectations to calculate ratings. Its new projection is that both international benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate crude will average $40 this year, $45 next year and $50 from 2018 onwards. In December 2014, S&P was using a long-term Brent price assumption of $85. The agency said on Tuesday that the scale of the reduction in its price expectations meant that even investment grade companies were affected. It added that it expected many of those companies to continue to cut capital spending and raise their productivity, but “these actions, for the most part, are insufficient to stem the meaningful deterioration expected in credit measures over the next few years”. The agency said it would assess Exxon’s “financial policies and strategies for mitigating the potential impact of the downturn”, as well as look at its 2015 results. Exxon reported a 50 per cent drop in earnings for 2015, a smaller decline than for rivals Chevron and BP, and is cutting capital spending sharply, but its net debt rose by $10.6bn during the year to $35bn as it borrowed to pay its dividend. Ratings for Chevron as well as EOG Resources, Apache and Devon Energy, three large independent oil and gas producers, were cut but remained investment grade. Ratings for Hess, Marathon Oil and Murphy Oil, three other leading independent US exploration and production companies, were cut to BBB-, also still investment grade but just one notch above junk. ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, was also put on watch for a possible downgrade within 90 days. S&P said this would depend on the company’s ability to achieve cost savings and asset sales, and to cut capital spending without hurting production rates. There was good news for four others, however: Occidental Petroleum, EQT, Cimarex Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources were affirmed at investment grade ratings. The moves follow S&P’s announcement on Monday that it had cut Royal Dutch Shell’s rating by one notch to A+ from AA-, and put a negative outlook on other large European oil companies including BP, Statoil and Total.Yields on investment grade energy bonds, which move inversely to their price, have climbed rapidly as oil tumbled over the past year, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The yield on the US bank’s energy index had risen to 5.36 per cent on Tuesday, more than 1.9 percentage points above its low last April. The spread of the yield on the energy index above US government bonds has widened to its highest level since the country started to emerge from recession in 2009.
20;EOG;Eog Resources;2015-12-28T18:32:05Z;Oil companies brace for a grim 2016 amid sustained price crash;Majors including Shell plan more cost-cuts;"As a miserable year for the oil industry draws to a close, any relief executives might feel will be tempered by the knowledge that 2016 is shaping up to be even worse.The collapse in oil and gas prices that began in the summer of last year has already cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, and caused projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars to be cancelled or delayed. Today, the external environment is more challenging than it was a year ago, and the energy companies’ ability to cope with tough conditions is diminished.BP is cutting 4,000 jobs across its exploration and production business, in a further round of cost cutting as oil companies continue to feel the pain of a plunging oil price. Matthew Vincent asks Chris Adams, FT energy editor, how the industry is standing up to the tough market conditions.For oil and gas producers, 2016 will be a year of cost-cutting, restructuring, refinancing when it is possible, and in some cases bankruptcy when it is not. Merger and acquisition activity, which was sluggish this year because of disagreements over valuations, may pick up speed.Oil and gas producers that have other sources of revenues such as refining and chemicals operations, and that still have access to capital markets, will find life difficult but should be able to survive. Companies that are exclusively focused on production and have weak balance sheets will have done well if they can make it through the year.The outlook was already dire a year ago. Since then, Brent crude has fallen a further 39 per cent, to about $37 per barrel on Monday, and is trading at close to an 11-year low. Longer-dated oil futures prices have also dropped sharply, making it less attractive for producers to use derivatives to protect their revenues, and raising expectations that crude will stay “lower for longer”. Prices for natural gas, which are linked to oil under contracts used in Europe and Asia, have been falling too. In the US, the warm winter weather has helped drive benchmark Henry Hub gas to a 16-year low.Many of the levers available for responding to weak prices have already been pulled, according to Andy Brogan of Ernst & Young, the accounting firm. “Companies had oil price hedges in place, they had costs they could cut relatively quickly, they had capital expenditures that they could put on the backburner,” he says. “A lot of these things are going away.”Oil producers have cut costs through efficiency gains and by driving down the rates they have been charged by their suppliers, the oilfield services companies. ConocoPhillips, the world’s largest independent oil and gas producer by market capitalisation, said earlier this month that the cost of land rigs for drilling wells in the US had dropped by 32 per cent over the past year, while the cost of hydraulic fracturing to bring those wells into production had fallen by 38 per cent.US shale oil producers have also continued the steady improvements in productivity they have achieved in recent years. EOG Resources, for example, said last month it had cut the average time to drill a well in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas from 8.9 days last year to 7.7 days.Companies have also been cutting capital spending. BP of the UK said in October it proposed to spend about $19bn this year, down from an original plan of $24bn to $26bn.Such cuts have helped stabilise the industry’s finances. The leading listed oil companies will on average need a Brent crude price of $66 per barrel next year to cover their capital spending, interest payments and dividends from their cash flows, down from $81 this year, according to Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy. Before the cost and spending cuts, they would have needed $104 per barrel to achieve that cash break-even.The break-even level of $66 per barrel, however, still means that at today’s oil prices the industry’s borrowings are set to rise. The large international oil companies can accept higher debts, but do not want their borrowings to run out of control, and they have started to announce a new round of cost reductions. Royal Dutch Shell, which is trying to win shareholder approval for its proposed takeover of BG Group, said this month it planned a further 2,800 job cuts, about 3 per cent of the combined group’s workforce, once the deal goes through.Falling rates for oilfield services will continue to deliver lower costs for producers as contracts come up for renegotiation. For example, Transocean’s Deepwater Champion rig is under contract to ExxonMobil to work in the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of $395,000 per day from November to January, down 41 per cent compared to its previous day rate.How the energy landscape could be reconfigured by the dramatic slump in crude prices

Further readingThere are, however, limits on how far this cost deflation can go. Charges for oilfield services have to be high enough for providers to stay in business. Dave Lesar, chief executive of Halliburton, argues that rates in the US are already at unsustainably low levels. Companies have been raising productivity, for example by drilling in only the best areas, but there are signs that in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken of North Dakota, two of the three largest shale oil regions of the US, productivity gains are levelling off.Nor can companies continue to cut capital spending indefinitely without damaging their revenues. This year companies have typically been focusing on projects that have quick paybacks in production, while slamming the brakes on exploration and longer-term developments, but the natural decline of oilfields means that continued investment is needed to stop output falling.The prospect of tighter supply in the future is laying the foundations for a recovery in oil prices, and companies that have cut costs will be well-placed to benefit. “If oil goes back to $60, things might start to look a lot better,” says Tom Ellacott of Wood Mackenzie. “The sector should have reset at a lower cost base.”The one ray of hope in the oil industry’s Pandora’s Box of troubles is that the greater the cuts in exploration and development spending now, the stronger the eventual upturn is likely to be. The task facing oil companies will be to stay in business for long enough to enjoy that rebound when it comes.For small and midsized companies that use derivatives to hedge their revenues against commodity price risk, one of the mounting pressures in 2016 will be the exhaustion of positions put in place when oil and gas futures were higher than they are today.In the face of unattractive futures prices, for deliveries for years to come, companies have been hedging less. This year, 52 per cent of the leading US independent companies’ oil production was hedged, but only 39 per cent of 2016’s expected output was covered at the end of September, according to Energy Aspects, a consultancy.The hedges that are in place are typically at lower prices, too. The average floor price is $64.80 for 2016, compared to $74.80 for 2015, says Energy Aspects. Pioneer Natural Resources, which is one of the most hedged US companies for next year, has covered 85 per cent of its expected production for 2016, but at a price of $59 per barrel, compared to $71 per barrel for this year, adds the consultancy.The progressive weakening of hedging positions is one factor stoking investors’ anxieties about smaller oil and gas companies, and the more highly leveraged ones in particular. The energy sector of the Bloomberg US high-yield bond index has dropped 20 per cent this year.“A lot of companies [refinanced] this year, and their hope was ‘This will let us fight another day’,” says Steve Wood, managing director of the oil and gas team at Moody’s, the credit rating agency. “Now the other day has come, or is coming. And they are going to run out of money.”Fitch, another rating agency, has predicted that default rates for high-yield energy companies will hit 11 per cent next year, exceeding the most recent peak of 9.8 per cent in 2009, after oil prices plunged during the financial crisis."

Both figures were broadly in line with the consensus estimate among Wall Street economists.Dave Cote, chief executive, said the company would “plan costs and spending conservatively” while continuing to invest in high-growth areas and technologies.The upbeat news comes a day after 3M, another large diversified manufacturer, cut its 2015 profit guidance, “reflecting the realities of a continued slow-growth global economy”.Honeywell shares rallied 5.7 per cent on Wednesday to $104.08.ConAgra Foods climbed after Jefferies gave the company a “buy” rating and a price target that implied a 26 per cent upside.Analyst Akshay Jagdale said the market was “undervaluing” the company’s underlying assets.He cited involvement from Jana Partners, an activist investor, a new chief executive and substantial cost-cutting efforts as bullish catalysts that could drive the stock higher.ConAgra shares rose 3 per cent to $40.80, pushing the gain this year to 12.5 per cent.The S&P 500 energy sector was the worst performer by a wide margin after a US government report showed an unexpected swelling of crude inventories last week.US crude oil prices swooned more than 4.4 per cent to $35.69 a barrel.Among the laggards were oil exploration and production companies. EOG Resources, one of the biggest participants in the shale industry, dropped 2 per cent to $75.78. ConocoPhillips fell 2.4 per cent to $49.35.On the other side of the spectrum, the solar industry received a jolt of energy when Guggenheim Partners flagged it as a “big winner” in a US spending bill that could be passed in Congress before the holiday break.SolarCity, one of the companies flagged in the note, surged 34 per cent to $53.69. First Solar, also mentioned, rallied 9.7 per cent to $65.62.CVS Health climbed after it increased the lower end of its profit guidance for 2016.The pharmacy chain sees adjusted profits of $5.73 to $5.88 a share, compared with Wall Street expectations of $5.80. It increased its quarterly dividend by 21 per cent to 43 cents a share.CVS shares climbed 5.4 per cent to $97.56, bringing its gains for the year to 1.3 per cent.After the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates, the utilities and telecommunications sectors led the way higher for US stocks, while energy and materials lagged behind.By the close of trading, the S&P 500 had risen 1.5 per cent to 2,073.07, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had increased 1.3 per cent to 17,749.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5 per cent to 5,071.13.

Among Thursday’s big gainers were companies that have bet on America’s shale oil boom.EOG Resources, one of the biggest names in the industry, saw its shares climb as much as 4 per cent, helping bring down its year-to-date fall to 20 per cent by markets close.Smaller names rode the wave higher as shares in Apache advanced 1.4 per cent to $39.72 while those in Devon Energy rose 1.8 per cent to $37.75.The S&P 500 energy sector remained static in choppy trading on Thursday, slightly outperforming the broader stock market. That represents a sharp change in sentiment from the third quarter, where the sector shed more than 18 per cent.An early rally in crude oil futures helped propel the gains after the price of crude fell more than 20 per cent last quarter. US crude oil rallied as much as 3 per cent before pulling back gains to a 0.8 per cent loss.Energy majors, which have more diversified operations, benefited, but enthusiasm soon faded. ExxonMobil and Chevron, both blue-chip companies, zigzagged between gains and losses and settled 0.4 and 0.6 per cent lower at $74.05 and $78.40 respectively by close.The rally comes just a day after the US Department of Energy said American crude oil supplies jumped by some 4m barrels last week.Stocks remain at the most elevated level for this time of year in at least 80 years. Adding to potential headwinds for the sector, Morgan Stanley said this week it expected technological advancements would help companies continue making money at lower prices, meaning supplies could remain elevated for some time.General Motors climbed 2.2 per cent to $30.67 after it reported a 12 per cent increase in September auto sales.

24;EOG;Eog Resources;2015-09-06T12:37:25Z;US shale industry braced for bankruptcies;Falling oil prices put groups with high costs under severe financial strain;"The world may run on oil, but the oil industry runs on capital, and for US shale producers that capital is starting to dry up.Earlier in the year it was still relatively easy for US exploration and production companies to raise capital by selling debt or equities, in spite of last year’s oil price crash caused by a global glut. Now those sales have slowed sharply, and the financial strain on the industry is growing.The next turn of the screw is approaching, in the shape of another round of redeterminations of “borrowing bases”: the valuations of companies’ oil and gas reserves used by banks to secure their lending.The shale industry, which has been responsible for rapid growth in US oil production since 2009, is not about to die. There are plenty of strong companies that have healthy balance sheets, low costs, or both, and they should be able to ride out the downturn. But there are very wide differences in resilience between companies. Those with high costs or high debts, or both, face a turbulent future.“In retrospect, easy money and a difficult time for finding the right thing to invest in led to an overshoot in US [oil] production growth,” says Edward Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup. “Companies that should never have been brought to life were brought to life.”Now that overshoot is heading for a correction. Analysts expect a wave of asset deals, acquisitions and corporate bankruptcies, as weaker companies struggle to avoid collapse, not always successfully.Already 16 US oil production companies have defaulted this year, according to Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency.The biggest failure has been Samson Resources, which was bought by a consortium led by KKR in 2011 for $7.2bn, and said last month it intended to seek bankruptcy protection in September.There are eight oil producers with credit ratings of triple-C or lower, meaning that “they’ve got about a year or less before they burn out of cash”, says Thomas Watters, a managing director at S&P.The next hurdles facing many of those companies will be their borrowing base redeterminations, which typically take effect on October 1.The previous round in March and April was less brutal for the companies than some had feared. This one is likely to be significantly tougher, draining liquidity away from struggling companies.Since the spring, expectations that oil prices might rebound have quickly faded, meaning that banks will be using lower assumptions when valuing reserves.The banks are also being warned by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the federal regulator, to watch out for the risks involved in lending to oil and gas companies, prompting fears that loans could be withdrawn from businesses that would be financially viable if they were given a little more time.Mark Sadeghian of Fitch, the rating agency, argues that banks will again try to avoid cutting back their lending too sharply. “We don’t expect anything cataclysmic,” he says. “It makes sense for banks to broker a deal, as opposed to driving companies to the wall.”Even if they keep fragile companies alive, though, the banks are still likely to want to cut their lending, he adds.Buddy Clark, chair of the energy practice at Haynes and Boone, a law firm, says that when companies announce their new borrowing limits, investors should make sure they read the fine print. In some cases borrowing bases will be set at a comfortable level, but could be scheduled to reduce over six months, or have a shorter review period.“The hope is that the market will pick up in time to allow them to sell equity to shore up the balance sheet,” says Mr Clark.As companies seek to persuade investors and banks to back them, their costs are critical. Under pressure from the slump in the prices of both oil and natural gas, US exploration and production companies have achieved remarkable feats in cutting costs — in some cases by as much as 25 per cent — and raising productivity.EOG Resources, the first company to produce shale oil successfully, said last month that it had reduced the cost of drilling a well and starting production in the Eagle Ford formation of south Texas to $5.5m, down from $6.1m last year, while making it yield more oil.Whiting Petroleum, the largest producer in the Bakken formation of North Dakota, said earlier this month that “enhanced completions” — using higher volumes of sand when fracturing wells to release oil — could raise production by 40 to 50 per cent while increasing costs by only 15 per cent.How the energy landscape could be reconfigured by the dramatic fall in crude prices

Further readingHowever, the sector is a heterogeneous group. A recent study found that the oil producer with the lowest full-cycle cost per barrel — a measure that combines the expense of extracting crude plus the investment needed to replace reserves — was Seven Generations, at about $20. The highest-cost producers were Breitburn Energy Partners and Denbury Resources, at about $70, according to Moody’s, the rating agency responsible for the study.The median full-cycle cost per barrel was about $51 for oil-focused companies, implying that at present prices of about $46 for US crude, more than half of the producers are losing money.Eventually, supply and demand in the global oil market are expected to come back into balance, sending crude prices higher. US oil production is already falling, according to the government’s Energy Information Administration, reflecting the 58 per cent drop in the number of rigs drilling for crude since last October.But this rebalancing of the market could be a lengthy process. While it is working through, more US shale producers are sure to fall by the wayside.One factor increasing the financial pressure on small and mid-size US oil companies is that their hedging positions, using derivatives to guarantee higher revenues than the current short-term crude price, are running out.Hedges taken out in the first half of last year could have secured a price of about $90 per barrel for US crude, roughly twice today’s level.With prices for oil for delivery both now and in the future having fallen sharply, US exploration and production companies are markedly less enthusiastic about hedging. The revenues they can lock in with derivatives are much now lower compared to about 18 months ago.The leading US shale oil producers have hedged about 63 per cent of their expected production for this year and just 43 per cent for next year, according to Energy Aspects, a consultancy.That compares with them having hedged 75 to 80 per cent of their 2014 production by the summer of last year.“A lot of companies, when prices are falling, are not inclined to put more hedges on,” says Buddy Clark of Haynes and Boone, a law firm.Any remaining eagerness to hedge will have taken a blow from the latest slump in prices. US crude for delivery in December 2016 has dropped from $63 per barrel in May to about $53 by early this month.Even so, says Virendra Chauhan of Energy Aspects, many companies are still hedging some of their production.In some cases, it appears to be because companies have got a good grip on their costs, and know they can make a profit even at the low prices they can secure by hedging.US fracking model does not bode well for UK / From Dr G Rayner"
25;EOG;Eog Resources;2015-05-06T18:03:00Z;Shale looks more like dotcom boom than Lehman debt bubble;How David Einhorn flagged up important weaknesses in shale oil business model;"In November 2007, hedge fund manager David Einhorn gave a presentation at the Value Investing Congress in New York, raising concerns about Lehman Brothers. He queried the bank’s accounting and suggested it might have to recognise as-yet undisclosed losses. “If they do, everyone will be surprised,” one of his slides read. Within a year, the bank had collapsed, and the bets against the investment bank, called shorts, taken by Mr Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital paid off lavishly. Reputations are made by such bold calls, and Mr Einhorn made his.So when he stood up on Monday at the Ira Sohn investment conference in New York and turned his fire on US shale oil production companies, people paid attention.His presentation is essential reading for anyone interested in energy. If he is right, there are profound implications not just for investors in US exploration and production companies, but for the world.His broadside had three principal elements. First, he criticised earnings reporting by oil companies, especially bespoke measures such as Ebitdax, which “basically stands for earnings before a lot of stuff”.Second, focusing on cash as a more reliable guide to the true health of the industry, he highlighted how the large shale producers had since 2006 spent $80bn more in acquiring and developing reserves than they have made from selling oil. They were kept in business only by a constant inflow of capital.Third, he observed that investors who believe oil prices are going to rise would do better to invest in the commodity itself than in shale producers’ shares.All those points are justified to some degree. Are they proof that shale oil is a bubble that is about to burst? Maybe not.Looking at shale companies’ cash flows is vital, as Mr Einhorn suggests, but the picture is not as bleak as he paints it. His suggestion that the companies have nothing to show for their $80bn net cash outflow is misleading: they have been building up lease positions in oilfields that they can drill out in the future, and they have been acquiring expertise in how to extract that oil.Moreover, their cash position had been on an improving trend. Last summer, before oil and gas prices plunged, leading US exploration and production companies were collectively on course to reach cash flow break-even in 2015.The oil crash has moved that point further away, of course, but shale companies have kept it within reach by cutting their costs sharply. Pioneer Natural Resources said on Wednesday that by the end of this year its cost for drilling and completing a well would be 20 per cent lower than last year.It is clear that even after the rebound in US crude prices from below $43 per barrel in March to above $61 today, the shale industry still needs a higher price if it is to start growing again. It may not be all that much higher a price, though. EOG Resources has talked about resuming growth at $65 or more.Bulls in charge as Brent rises towards $70 a barrel but longevity of rally in question.Continue readingMr Einhorn is also right when he points out that shale oil companies’ equity valuations imply higher crude prices than the futures market. Some enterprising hedge funds may already be exploiting that arbitrage opportunity. Still, as anyone who knows the commodity markets will tell you, a futures price is not a forecast, still less a reliably accurate one.With growing global demand, reduced investment jeopardising future supplies, and the risk of future geopolitical disruptions, it is certainly possible that oil prices will carry on heading higher.The shale oil revolution looks more like the dotcom boom than the debt bubble that brought down Lehman. The technological progress in oil production is real. But Mr Einhorn has identified important weaknesses in the shale oil business model, and there are likely to be further casualties, even if the industry itself manages to survive and grow.As in any commodity business, the decisive factor will be costs. If shale production is more expensive than other sources of oil, it will not survive, and producers need to be able to undercut other high-cost areas such as Brazil’s deep water and Canada’s oil sands. Lower-cost shale producers can be the Amazon and Google of this new world; the higher-cost ones will be Pets.com.ed.crooks@ft.com"

Prices later pulled back to nearer $68 as traders booked profits.Data from the US Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy, showed crude inventories fell by 3.9m barrels last week, having previously stood at 490m barrels, the highest since records began.While traders are looking for signs of lower US output, some of the largest shale producers are preparing to respond to the price rally. EOG Resources this week forecast a return to “double-digit” production growth if benchmark US crude rose to $65 per barrel or higher.“We expect our oil production to return to growth in the fourth quarter, building momentum as we head into 2016,” said William Thomas, EOG’s chief executive.The US benchmark on Nymex hit $62.58 a barrel on Wednesday, its highest this year.Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter and the most powerful member of the Opec cartel, has said it has no plans to change its production policy, which has seen it increase production above 10m b/d as it pushes to expand its share of the global market.Saudi Arabia’s production costs are in the low single-digits but it has been forced to dip into its cash reserve to pay for generous social spending programmes.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Opec is due to meet in Vienna next month and is expected to stick with the Saudi-led policy.Macro hedge funds and other large speculators have also provided a boost to oil’s rally by buying dollar-priced commodities as the greenback has weakened. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other major currencies, has dropped 5 per cent since early March.In Brent and US crude combined, hedge funds have established a net long position — the difference between bets on rising and falling prices — of almost 550,000 futures and options contracts, according to exchange and regulatory data.That is the equivalent of more than 550m barrels of oil on paper and one of the largest fund positions on record in crude."
27;EOG;Eog Resources;2015-05-05T18:39:28Z;Shale groups rise to oil price challenge;EOG raises prospect of production growth before the end of the year;EOG Resources, the largest shale oil producer in the US, on Tuesday raised the prospect of its crude production returning to growth before the end of the year.US shale oil companies have been detailing in their first-quarter results how they are cutting costs and increasing productivity as they grapple with sharply lower crude prices since last summer.Companies including EOG, Anadarko Petroleum, Concho Resources and Noble Energy reported steep cuts in both capital and operating costs, while their production is either growing or roughly flat.EOG said that if benchmark US West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $65 per barrel or higher — compared with its price of about $60 on Tuesday — then the company could resume “double-digit” production growth, while covering its capital spending from its operating cash flows.EOG reported a loss of $170m for the first quarter, and an $843m cash outflow, and reiterated its guidance that it expected its average production for 2015 to be roughly unchanged compared with last year.However, William Thomas, EOG’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday morning that the company had been building up a backlog of wells that had been drilled but not yet completed, and planned to start bringing some of these on stream in the third quarter.“We expect our oil production to return to growth in the fourth quarter, building momentum as we head into 2016,” he added.EOG’s statement came after David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager who made his name betting against Lehman Brothers before the bank collapsed, on Monday argued that shale oil producers were overvalued, labelling them “frack addicts” that failed to create value from their investments even when crude was over $100 per barrel.New extraction techniques and oil prices boost US oil production“A business that burns cash and doesn’t grow isn’t worth anything,” he said.However, US shale oil companies, while reporting losses or very small profits for the first three months of this year, are arguing that cost cuts put them on a course for renewed financial health once crude prices recover.Noble reported a $22m loss for the first quarter, but said it had greatly improved the efficiency of its drilling.Concho, which operates in the Permian Basin of west Texas, reported a profit of just $7.5m for the first quarter and said it had cut the number of rigs it was using from 36 at the start of the year to 18 today.However, it raised the midpoint of the range of its guidance for 2015 production growth from 18 per cent to 20 per cent.Timothy Leach, Concho’s chief executive, said: “We expect to deliver higher production growth on a lower capital spend and with fewer rigs.”Anadarko, which has offshore operations in Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as its US shale business, said it expected average production for 2015 to be slightly lower than in 2014, as it reported a $3.3bn loss for the first quarter, including a writedown of $2.9bn.The company said it had cut the average cost of drilling a well in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas by 14 per cent since the last three months of 2014.Al Walker, Anadarko’s chief executive, struck a cautionary note on the company’s call with analysts, saying it would be careful about stepping up spending and production growth in response to a recovery in oil prices.“As we achieve higher prices, we could see activity increase and prices, unfortunately, could suffer as a result of higher production than people are anticipating,” he said.“So we’re going to be a little careful in terms of adding to that production number.”

For many, that was true even when oil was at $100 per barrel.“Depletion gets ignored because it is not a cash item, and capex gets ignored because it is funding future growth,” he argued. “When someone doesn’t want you to look at traditional metrics, it is a good time to look at traditional metrics.”As well as Pioneer, the companies singled out in the presentation on Monday were EOG Resources, Whiting Petroleum, Continental Resources and Concho Resources.Mr Einhorn — who made his reputation shorting Allied Capital, a mid-cap lender in the US, from 2002 — likened the companies to St Joe, a Florida landowner that could not develop its land profitably even at the peak of the housing bubble.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

29;EOG;Eog Resources;2015-03-24T13:33:53Z;Low returns drag down US shale oil industry;Falling oil price puts pressure on groups to show profit on investment;"In the boom years of the US shale oil industry, profitability was something of an optional extra. Companies were focused on growth, it was easy to raise capital, and making a decent return on investment could be put off for another day.Now that growth is grinding to a halt because of the slump in oil prices, investors may become less tolerant of persistently low returns.The industry’s poor record of returns on investment was highlighted in a presentation last month from EOG Resources, the largest shale oil producer and one of the most efficient.EOG said it made a return on capital employed of 12.4 per cent in 2013 and 13.7 per cent last year, but noted that comparable US exploration and production companies had done far worse — making just 3.4 per cent on average in 2013 and 4.3 per cent in 2014.Given that those low returns were made with US benchmark crude prices averaging about $98 per barrel in 2013 and about $93 last year, prospects for profitability at today’s price of about $47 a barrel look dire.“Companies were so concerned with growth, they lost sight of profitable growth,” says Dennis Cassidy of AlixPartners, a consultancy.“People said the oil industry was doing great, and it was, in terms of growth and activity and feeling good about it. But when you looked under the covers, it wasn’t really,” he adds.Generally low returns across the industry meant that oil companies had to keep attracting fresh capital to finance their investment programmes.In 2013 and 2014 the US E&P sector raised $34.2bn in new equity, $62.6bn from bond sales and $191bn from syndicated loans, according to Dealogic.Even the most successful companies were spending more on drilling and completing wells than they booked in cash revenue.Continental Resources, for example, made cash from operations of $3.36bn last year, but spent $4.59bn on capital investment. Whiting Petroleum, the largest producer in the Bakken shale area of North Dakota, reported cash from operations of $1.82bn and capital spending of $2.86bn.Companies were so concerned with growth, they lost sight of profitable growthSo far, the flow of capital into the industry has not dried up. US E&P companies have so far this year raised $7.93bn from bonds, $11.7bn from syndicated loans and $8.42bn from new shares.Equity issuance has been particularly strong, with companies including Noble Energy, Encana, Concho Resources, Laredo Petroleum and Southwestern Energy announcing large placings.On Monday evening they were joined by Whiting, which had been looking for a possible buyer, but opted instead to issue up to 40.3m shares worth about $1.4bn, and raise up to $1.15bn from new convertible notes.Allen Gilmer, chief executive of DrillingInfo, an oilfield data company, says the willingness of investors and lenders to continue to support E&P companies is a marked contrast from other oil industry downturns, when capital investment dried up very quickly.At a time of low interest rates, he says, the oil industry still looks attractive to some investors. “The world is looking for yield,” he says. “That’s the basic problem: there’s not a lot out there.”There is a massive capital shortage on one side and a massive capital supply on the other, and they don’t seem to be holding hands yetThe surge in interest in oil and gas investment from private equity firms is more evidence of that. Blackstone has said it has $9bn available for energy investments, while others including Apollo, Goldman Sachs’s investment arm and Carlyle also have or are raising funds to put into the sector.But there are signs that investors are becoming less tolerant of low returns. Whiting shares opened down 20 per cent on Tuesday in reaction to Monday’s fundraising.Despite the amount of private equity capital available to put into energy, only a few deals have so far been done, suggesting a gap in expectations between companies and would-be investors.Greg Matlock of Ernst & Young, the professional services group, says: “There is a massive capital shortage on one side and a massive capital supply on the other, and they don’t seem to be holding hands yet.”Many E&P companies are trying to avoid raising capital by covering their investment spending from their cash flow. Chesapeake Energy on Monday announced another round of cuts in its drilling programme to achieve that objective by the end of the year.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionIf the US Federal Reserve follows through with plans to raise interest rates, the E&P sector is probably going to see its cost of capital rise further.“One day I expect the punchbowl will be taken away,” says Michael Hulme of Carmignac, the French fund manager.Investors will be selective, focusing on companies that can be profitable even at low oil prices, he adds.“What you’re looking for is the company that can put a dollar in the ground and get two dollars out; not the one that puts a dollar in and will get out 80 or 90 cents.”"
30;EOG;Eog Resources;2015-03-19T09:58:16Z;Demystifying the ‘Fracklog’;Number of uncompleted shale wells will drop as oil prices recover;Sometimes new words are useful additions to the language. Sometimes they can create confusion.“Fracklog” is the catchy neologism for the backlog of US shale wells that have been drilled but not yet brought into production.More prosaically known as “drilled but uncompleted” or “waiting on completions”, these wells still need to be fracked and fitted with production equipment for the oil to flow.Interest in the fracklog started picking up last month when EOG Resources, the largest US shale producer, said it would “intentionally delay” completing some of its wells.Some analysts think this tactic, spread across the industry, will be significant later in the year. They argue that as soon as US crude prices recover a little, companies will start production from those uncompleted wells, bringing a rush of extra supply on to the market. This could stifle any recovery in prices.There may be something in this argument. EOG expects to add about 85 uncompleted wells this year, while Anadarko Petroleum said recently it would drill but not complete 125 wells this year.Apache said it would defer some completions, without giving a number, while Chesapeake Energy said it planned to build a “little bit of inventory” in uncompleted wells in the Eagle Ford shale.For some producers, deferring completions makes sense. Completing a well can account for between a half and three-quarters of its total cost, so slowing completions is a quick way to start delivering the cuts in capital spending.The contango in crude futures, with prices significantly higher for next year than for immediate sales, also creates an incentive to leave oil in the ground and extract it at a later date.And with activity slowing sharply, the cost of completing wells could be lower later in the year, too, as the companies providing fracking and other services cut their rates.However, it is still unclear just how widespread the practice of deferring completions really is.The diversity of US shale producers makes it difficult to generalise about their strategies. Extrapolating from large, financially sound businesses such as EOG and Anadarko is particularly hazardous.There are likely to be many shale producers, with debt payments to meet or loans to repay, that cannot afford the luxury of a fracklog. They may also have commitments with drilling contractors that mean there are limits on how quickly they can lay down rigs. If they have paid for the rigs already, they might as well use them.125Number of wells Anadarko Petroleum said it would drill but not complete this yearIndeed, other leading shale oil producers including Marathon Oil, Whiting Petroleum and Hess, have said they do not plan to defer completions at all.The number of wells “waiting on completion services” has been rising sharply in North Dakota, home to the prolific Bakken shale formation. They have risen from an average of about 650 last October to 825 at the end of January.Some of that increase may, however, be due to tighter regulations on flaring. In the fourth quarter of last year and again at the start of this year North Dakota cut the proportion of associated gas from oil wells that can be burnt off, forcing producers to work out other solutions.Others may also be waiting for the cuts in North Dakota’s state taxes on oil production that will kick in once West Texas Intermediate crude has been below $55.09 for five consecutive months, a point that looks likely to be reached in May.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, expects that across the US, the fracklog will actually be lower at the end of the year than its estimate of about 3,000 todayUS exploration and production companies may be able to sustain their production this year, but only through intense efforts to improve productivity and cut costs. Expecting them to coast to growth on a cushion of drilled but uncompleted wells would be a mistake.The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
31;EOG;Eog Resources;2015-03-15T15:11:07Z;US shale industry shows remarkable resilience;Producers may be able to step up activity and resume production growth even with oil below $75;"For the US shale industry, competing against Saudi Arabia and the other low-cost oil producers in the Middle East is like stepping into the boxing ring with the heavyweight champion.At its latest meeting in November, Opec, the oil producers’ cartel, decided against a cut in output to support the crude price, sending it into freefall. Saudi Arabia, the cartel’s most powerful member, has insisted that this was not intended to be a “war on shale”, but Ali al-Naimi, the country’s oil minister, used a speech in Berlin this month to stress that it was not the role of Middle East nations to “subsidise higher-cost producers”.North American shale companies are among those higher-cost producers, and evidence of the impact on them of the near 60 per cent fall in US crude since last summer is now mounting: in declining profits, cuts in jobs and investment and idled equipment. A handful of shale producers have gone bankrupt, while some others are struggling with large debts.The number of rigs drilling for oil in the US has dropped 46 per cent from its peak last October, and this is starting to affect output. The US government’s Energy Information Administration said last week that in two of the three principal shale regions — the Bakken of North Dakota and the Eagle Ford of south Texas — oil production was expected to fall marginally next month. Only in the Permian basin of west Texas is it still rising.But, so far, overall US output seems to be only levelling off, rather than collapsing. If US crude stays at its present level of about $45 per barrel, then it seems likely that production will start falling later this year. But Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, is forecasting that US oil production will grow this year and next, if there is a rebound in prices to about $60 per barrel.The industry’s ability to keep growing at lower prices than in recent years will depend on how far it can reduce its costs. Adam Sieminski, head of the EIA, says: “We have seen that shale oil works very well at $100 per barrel. Now we are going to find out if it works at $50 to $75.”The round of earnings and outlook statements in recent weeks from the US exploration and production companies — the small to midsized independents that led the shale revolution — showed that while they are all cutting activity sharply, none is expecting a corresponding fall in output.Even more than conventional oilfields, shale puts operators on a treadmill because the flow from each well falls rapidly after it is brought into production. Companies need to keep drilling just to hold output steady. Yet the US independents are telling their investors that they can maintain production roughly level, even while running many fewer rigs.EOG Resources, for example, plans a 40 per cent capital spending cut this year but expects just a 3 per cent drop in production. Hess is cutting spending by 14 per cent but expects production growth of about 12 per cent.Achieving the outcomes projected by US shale producers for this year would represent one of the most remarkable productivity performances ever achieved by any industry.There is a precedent for such a dramatic improvement. After 2008, US natural gas prices collapsed, and some analysts predicted that shale gas producers would be wiped out.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingThe number of rigs drilling for gas fell from 1,606 in the summer of 2008 to just 268 last week. Yet US gas production has continued to rise.Moreover, it is often the same companies that coped with the fall in gas prices that are now facing the same phenomenon in the oil market. They have to show they can perform the same feat twice.The cost cuts and productivity gains that shale oil producers expect come in three categories.First, there are savings from putting pressure on suppliers of drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing and other services. Companies have generally been saying they expect reductions of 20 to 30 per cent this year.Second, companies benefit from focusing spending on their most productive assets. “You’re dropping all your worst-performing rigs and worst-performing rig crews and moving the rigs you have to your core areas,” says Randall Collum of Genscape, an energy research firm.Finally, there are productivity gains available from improved techniques.Companies are able to drill more wells with fewer rigs using methods such as “pad drilling”. This minimises the downtime between wells as rigs are dismantled, moved and reassembled by drilling several from a single location.EIA data show remarkable improvements in productivity, with production per rig from new wells rising in the past year by 24 per cent in the Eagle Ford, 29 per cent in the Bakken and 30 per cent in the Permian basin.Last October, the median break-even oil price needed for shale projects was estimated by IHS, a research group, at $57 per barrel. Falling costs mean this year that number will be significantly lower. If crude prices do start to pick up again, many analysts and executives think US shale producers may be able to step up activity again and resume production growth even with oil below $75.Although US shale is a higher-cost source of oil than some of the great fields of the Middle East, it may well turn out to be more resilient than Saudi Arabia and other Opec members would like.‘Assembly line’ drilling planned to cut down costsOne way that US shale oil producers are attempting to drive down costs is by developing a so-called “manufacturing model” for drilling.This involves standardising designs, equipment and techniques so that wells are less bespoke creations, and more like products coming off a factory assembly line.There were 37,500 wells drilled in the US last year, but many of the benefits of that large scale have not yet been captured.“Oil companies tend to change their minds a lot during the drilling process,” says Dennis Cassidy of AlixPartners, a consultancy.“So you have a supply chain that is very inefficient, because it has a lot of inventory and a lot of inefficiency so it can respond at the last minute.”Many companies are trying to learn from best practice in manufacturing to become more efficient. Some have even hired executives from leading manufacturers to show them how to do it.Drilling a well out in an oilfield is a different proposition from managing workflow in a factory, but Mr Cassidy argues there are still large savings available.“We’ve gone from the horse and buggy to maybe the Model T. We’re certainly not at the Tesla standard of state of the art modern manufacturing,” he says.“We may never get to an A+ standard, but there’s such a long way to go still that even a B+ is light years better than what we currently have.”Back to the top of the page"
32;EOG;Eog Resources;2015-02-19T17:18:55Z;Largest US shale group sees growth halt;EOG Resources delivers stark evidence of impact of weak prices;EOG Resources, the largest US shale oil producer, expects its rapid production growth of recent years to come to a halt in 2015, in the starkest sign yet of how weak crude prices are hitting the industry.The company told analysts on a call on Thursday that it was “intentionally choosing returns over growth”.However, it added that if prices were to rebound to about $65 per barrel next year, up from about $50 presently, it could resume “double-digit” growth next year.EOG is cutting capital spending by about 40 per cent this year, slowing the development of its reserves to avoid selling too much of its oil during what could be a short-term period of weak prices.Its plans, which are similar to those of other leading shale producers such as Devon Energy, point to a sharp slowdown in US oil production growth, and possibly falling output, this year.Noble Energy, another US exploration and production company, said on Thursday it planned to cut its capital spending by 40 per cent this year and expected its US oil production to grow by about 4 per cent on average for 2015 over 2014.EOG has been one of the biggest success stories of the US shale oil boom, increasing its crude production almost fourfold during 2010-14.Setting out its plans and reporting its 2014 earnings on Wednesday, however, the company said it expected its US oil production to be in a range of 264,000-293,000 barrels per day this year — about the same as the average of 282,000 barrels per day it reported for 2014.Jonathan Wolff at Jefferies estimated that by the end of the year, EOG’s US production would be running at a rate about 7 per cent lower than at the end of 2014.That abrupt slowdown contrasts sharply with last year, when its US production grew by 33 per cent. Mr Wolff wrote in a note that EOG had done “exactly the right thing”, but that its plans would be a disappointment for its “growth-oriented shareholder base”.The shares opened about 9 per cent lower on Thursday but quickly rebounded. By close of trading in New York, shares were down 2 per cent at $93.80.EOG is one of the most financially sound of US exploration and production companies, with a return on capital that is significantly higher and debts that are significantly lower than the average for its sector.Like rivals, however, it is slowing its drilling activity dramatically in response to lower prices.It will cut the number of rigs it has running this year by half to 27, and will focus on developing its most profitable prospects in its core areas of the Eagle Ford shale and the Delaware Basin, which are both in Texas.The Bakken shale of North Dakota remains a core area for the company but will be allocated less capital, EOG added, with only 25 wells completed this year compared with 59 last year.New extraction techniques and oil prices impact US oil productionBecause its borrowings are relatively low, with net debts of $3.8bn at the end of last year, or just 43 per cent of 2014’s underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, EOG is not under any imperative to stabilise its finances.It argues that it is likely to earn better returns by leaving some of its oil in the ground for longer.Because most of a shale well’s total output is generally produced in its first year, short-term prices make a significant difference to well economics.EOG’s latest investor presentation suggests that if oil prices rebound from $45 per barrel to $75, waiting six months to start production from a well would improve its after-tax rate of return by about 25 percentage points.Its executives said on the investor call that if prices rebounded to $65, it could achieve “very high” returns on capital and cover its spending on wells from its cash flows, making it possible to resume production growth.
33;EOG;Eog Resources;2015-01-02T14:03:59Z;US natural gas: withdrawal symptoms;Inventories are low, but supply is growing;Early last decade, natural gas was vaporous gold trapped under US soil. It was in short supply. Production from new wells declined quickly once they came on stream. Prices rose as much as sixfold between 2001 and 2005. The success of shale gas changed things, and most gas traders went short long ago. But last year’s frigid US winter tightened supplies, sending the gas price higher. Could prices jump again this winter?Probably not. US gas inventories are low for this time of year. This is not down to the pre-Thanksgiving snow storms, which dumped 10 feet of snow on parts of New York state. Rather, last winter’s supply reductions have not yet been refilled. Gas in storage remains slightly below the five-year seasonal average of 3.3tn cubic feet, a difference of just over one day of US demand.But the inventory number alone does not reflect this year’s increase in gas supply, due in part to new pipelines in the northeast. Previously, producers in areas such as the Marcellus could not get all their gas to market. Now they can. The added supply will more than cover any shortfall, according to the US Energy Information Administration. At nearly 73bn cf per day, the gas flowing exceeds last year’s by nearly 8 per cent. This could add 150bn cf to supply each month. At that rate any inventory shortage would disappear quickly. So gas prices have resumed their descent, down 29 per cent over the past month.Equity traders do not expect much improvement. Shares in US gas explorers have suffered with their oily peers. A price index of gas specialists such as Range Resources, Chesapeake and Southwestern Energy has lost 35 per cent since oil peaked in June, only marginally less than an index of oil explorers. Given the added gas supply, US oil explorers, such as EOG, should perform better versus gas specialists in the months ahead (ironically, EOG used to be a top gas producer).Only a much colder winter than last year will lift the natural gas price in the US.

34;EOG;Eog Resources;2014-12-09T18:08:39Z;US shale industry faces endurance test after Opec rejects cuts;Cartel’s refusal to cut oil output turns screw on US crude producers;"When Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries last month rejected calls for a production cut by Opec, the oil cartel, they put the responsibility for stabilising plummeting crude prices on to the US shale industry. Suhail al-Mazroui, energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, said US shale companies and other producers who had created an oil glut should “respect the needs of the market”. Less diplomatically, Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the leading shale oil producers, said Opec had “declared war” on the US industry.Two weeks on from that Opec decision — and against a backdrop of a 40 per cent fall in the oil price since June — evidence of its negative impact on US producers is starting to emerge.Rather than a war, the US shale industry is braced for a test of endurance. As the pressure on oil producers mounts, weak companies face the threat of dwindling investment, faltering production, forced asset sales and possible bankruptcy.The successful companies will be the ones that both entered the downturn in the strongest position and are most effective at improving their efficiency. They can hope to make it through to better days when the oil price recovers and are also likely to be able to pick up some undervalued assets.On Monday ConocoPhillips, the US’s largest exploration and production company, unveiled plans to cut its capital spending by about 20 per cent next year to $13.5bn — a steeper reduction than analysts had expected — and said it would defer drilling programmes in several North American shale areas.Last Friday Baker Hughes, the energy services group due to be bought by rival Halliburton, published data which showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas had fallen by 16 since October to 190. The number of rigs in the Bakken shale and related North Dakota formations had meanwhile dropped by 10 to 188.Also last week Drillinginfo, a consultancy, published figures showing that the number of new permits to drill wells had fallen by about 30 per cent in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford areas last month compared with October. That may overstate the likely drop in activity, because companies will have a backlog of permits they can use, but it is clear the industry is responding to a steep drop in the oil price.Allen Gilmer, Drillinginfo’s chief executive, said: “Because production from shale wells comes on fast and drops off fast, their economics are more exposed to short-term prices.” This applies more than for other types of oil production, where projects can take many years to come on stream, activity and output from shale can be stepped up and down quickly.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionWhile all shale companies are under pressure, their responses to the declining oil price will often be different. The companies vary widely in terms of debt levels, financing, hedging against price falls, product mix, location and quality of their assets and operational efficiency, and those differences have been reflected in share price movements over the past six months.One important issue for companies is their gas production. From 2010 until this summer, many US shale companies were shifting away from natural gas and towards more lucrative oil production.But now gas is back in favour. It has fallen less than oil and is likely to rebound if there is a cold winter in the US. As a result, the shares of gas-focused companies such as Cabot Oil and Gas have often been less affected than their more oil-focused peers.Another critical factor is debt. The shale surge has been built by borrowing: companies have typically spent more on drilling and completing wells than they have generated in cash flows and over the past decade about $163bn worth of high-yield debt has been issued by US oil and gas producers. Some have relied much more heavily on debt than others, however.If US crude were to average about $70 per barrel next year, EOG Resources and Anadarko Petroleum would have debts roughly equal to a year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — a very comfortable level, according to analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt, the investment bank. Other larger companies including Marathon Oil, Apache, Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy also have debt burdens that seem manageable.At the other end of the scale, companies such as Laredo Petroleum, SandRidge Energy and Range Resources would have debts about four times their ebitda, according to Tudor Pickering, while for Ultra Petroleum, Exco Resources, Goodrich Petroleum and Halcon Resources the multiple would be even higher.Beyond the financial metrics, the quality of a company’s assets is also important. Some of the companies that are focused on the Bakken shale, including Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, have been out of favour with investors, but the early evidence from rig activity and drilling permits is that there is no one “play” — as the different geological formations are known — that has been worse affected than any other.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingMore than the broad region where a company operates, it can be the quality of its specific lease areas within the region that matters, according to Cody Rice of Wood Mackenzie, another consultancy. In an area such as the Eagle Ford, companies in the core where the rocks are most productive can continue to thrive, he says, “but if you’re underperforming your peers, and you’re not in the core of the play, it’s not going to be so good for you”.The other crucial variable is operational performance. Reid Morrison, the advisory leader for US energy at PwC, the accounting firm, says that up until this summer there was very little focus on efficiency in the shale industry. When he tried to advise on cost savings, “the reaction we were getting was: ‘We agree with that, but it’s not important right now’,” he says. “There was a lot of confidence that the new floor for the oil price was around $90 per barrel.” Now that view has changed completely: interest in ideas for cost savings is soaring.Market upheaval: Unwelcome newcomer is likely here to stayWhen Opec members talk about the US contribution to world “oversupply”, they are referring to the growth in US crude production of about 4m barrels per day, about 80 per cent, since 2008. US shale has caused an upheaval in oil markets, and many rival producers, in Russia as well as Opec, hope it will go away.The existence of a group of financially strong shale companies such as EOG Resources and Devon Energy, however, suggests that the US industry is not about to crumble. They have been covering their capital spending from cash flow generation, unlike many of their rivals, and have little debt. They may cut capex next year, but do not face pressure to make deep reductions.Any good US shale assets owned by companies that cannot afford to develop them are likely to be picked up by financially stronger groups. If these can drive down costs, helped by increased spare capacity in the energy services industry, the oil prices needed for development to be commercially attractive could be lower than previous estimates have suggested.Many investors will suffer losses on exposure to oil and gas if prices stay at current levels. But some analysts expect the overall impact on US oil production to be relatively modest.“The rate of increase in production is going to slow down,” says Philip Verleger, an energy economist. “Even at $50 oil, though, US production probably plateaus, but it doesn’t start going down.”"
35;EOG;Eog Resources;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
36;EOG;Eog Resources;2014-11-12T12:18:20Z;US shale pioneers circle the wagons;Price war in oil market forces shale industry to reassess positions;"If there is “price war” in the oil market, as Adel Abdul Mahdi, Iraq’s oil minister, has suggested, the US shale industry is refusing to take flight at the first sound of gunfire.As the International Energy Agency, the watchdog backed by developed economies, said on Wednesday, the fall in oil prices by more than 25 per cent since June is set to cause a cut in investment by US shale companies.Some that have not yet decided their 2015 capital spending budgets have said that they are reassessing their drilling programmes. A few that had already set out spending plans have in the past couple of weeks announced cuts. So far, though, they look like tactical withdrawals to concentrate their efforts where they will be most effective, rather than admissions of defeat.Activity is already starting to slow. There were 1,568 rigs drilling for oil onshore in the US last week, 41 fewer than in mid-October, according to Baker Hughes, the oil services group.That figure is likely to fall further over the coming months. Halcon Resources, which operates in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas and the Bakken of North Dakota, said on Monday it planned to run just six rigs next year, compared with the eight it is running now and the 11 it had previously planned for 2015. Other leading shale oil companies have announced reductions in their capital spending plans: Continental Resources cut its 2015 budget from $5.2bn to $4.6bn; Rosetta Resources said it would spend about $950m next year, down from $1.2bn in 2014; and ConocoPhillips said it planned to spend less next year than the $16bn it is spending this year.Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, has made a bet that the recent pullback in oil prices will be shortlivedSee belowOther companies have suggested they are likely to follow suit. EOG Resources, one of the most successful shale oil producers, said at the time of its third-quarter results last week that it planned to ensure that its capital spending plus its dividend payments were in line with the cash flow it has coming in, and that would probably mean reduced activity in some areas.The pressure on shale producers is not so much profitability as liquidity. William Thomas, chief executive of EOG, said last week that even if oil fell to $40 the company could still earn a 10 per cent return in some areas, including the Bakken and the Eagle Ford shales.Pearce Hammond, an analyst at Simmons & Co, says that rate of return calculation is less important than another critical question: “How much cash do you have going out the door to drill the wells, and how much do you have coming in?”Debt has fuelled the shale boom, as producers outspent their cash flows and needed to borrow to fund investment. As prices fall, the companies that borrowed too much will find themselves under strain.The bond markets have already started to reflect some nervousness, with yields on junk bonds in the energy sector rising to their highest level in more than a year.Sean Sexton, an energy specialist at Fitch, the rating agency, says that last year he was surprised by how investors’ enthusiasm for oil companies’ debt was such that even low-rated companies were able to borrow at rates below 6 per cent. Now that discrepancy appears to be being corrected.Nevertheless, although oil prices at present levels of about $75-$80 for US crude will put pressure on some marginal companies, others should be fine, even if they still need to borrow to fund their drilling, Mr Sexton says.“They may have to pay a bit more in interest costs, but it’s not like they’re not going to be able to go to the market and raise money.”Pioneer Natural Resources, another shale oil producer, showed last week that the equity market was still open as a source of funds, announcing a planned share sale to raise $1bn to help finance its investment plans.While the debt and equity markets remain supportive, shale drilling activity is likely to ease off rather than collapse.Although they may be drilling less than they had expected, oil companies will also be focusing on maximising the production from the rigs they are using.John Richels, chief executive of Devon Energy, told analysts on a call last week that the company expected to cut the number of rigs it had running in the Mississippian region of northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas, described as an “emerging” business, and to shift them to more productive areas.Companies are also constantly pushing to use their rigs and other equipment more efficiently.Hess, one of the leaders in the Bakken shale, said in a rare presentation to analysts on Monday that it had cut the cost of each well there to $7.2m in the third quarter, down from $9.5m two years ago.Chesapeake Energy, founded by shale entrepreneur Aubrey McClendon but under new management since last year, said last week that it had cut its capital spending by 60 per cent from $14.2bn in 2012 to an expected $5.7bn this year, but had still increased production from its continuing businesses by 12 per cent in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the equivalent period of 2013.It is this sort of improvement that encourages shale producers to continue to project growth in output.Devon is talking about 20-25 per cent growth in its oil production next year, with capital spending about the same as this year, while EOG is projecting “double-digit” growth to 2017, if US crude stays at about $80. Continental is projecting growth of 23-29 per cent in its output next year, and Pioneer expects 16-20 per cent each year to 2016.These growth rates are based on annual averages, and these companies have been growing rapidly during 2014, so the comparisons with the end of this year will be less impressive.The companies’ predictions will not necessarily be fulfilled; it is important for them to show their investors they are still growing, so they have a temptation to err on the side of optimism. The IEA expects the impact of falling investment to show up not immediately, but in a decline in production in the “medium term”.Still, if the statements of the shale industry’s leaders are even broadly accurate, it looks as though oil prices may have to go significantly lower before US oil production starts to fall.Gambling with house moneyAs the oil price has been falling, many US shale executives have emphasised that they have a safety net in hedging strategies using futures and options that will protect their revenues against further falls in the crude price for the next year or two. Not Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources.He has decided to do without a net, announcing last week that the company had sold all of its hedges, for this year, 2015 and 2016, to raise $433m. If the oil price does fall further, Continental will face the full brunt of it.As Mr Hamm, who is the founder of one of Continental’s ancestor companies, owns about 68 per cent of the shares, he is taking a gamble principally with his own money.He is also betting the way he always has. He has long argued that any significant drop in oil prices could not last for long, and on a call with analysts last week he repeated the company’s “belief that the recent pullback in oil prices will be shortlived.”He added: “We feel like we're at the bottom rung here on prices, and we'll see them recover pretty drastically, pretty quick.”Like many in the US oil industry, Mr Hamm sees the long-term trends, with demand rising as hundreds of millions of people in emerging economies raise their standard of living, and constraints on supply in many parts of the world, especially the Middle East, and concludes that crude prices are likely to head higher.A couple of years of weaker prices, with slower production growth from shale companies, could be a good thing to allow global demand to “catch up” with the supply boom in the US, he said.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionHowever, the oil market is always tricky to predict, and has recently become more volatile after years of relative stability.Mr Hamm this week had some good news on his divorce settlement for his ex-wife Sue Ann, which was set by an Oklahoma court at $973m; significantly less than the multiple billions that some had expected, and about 7 per cent of his net worth.His decision on hedging could end up having a much more significant effect on his fortune."

38;EOG;Eog Resources;2014-02-05T18:20:09Z;US shale under fire over thirst for water;;Water shortages have put the US oil and gas industry on a “collision course” with other users because of the large volumes needed for hydraulic fracturing, a group of leading investors has warned.Almost 40 per cent of the oil and gas wells drilled since 2011 are in areas of “extremely high” water stress, according to Ceres, a network of investors that works on environmental and social issues. It highlights Texas, the heart of the US oil boom, and companies including Chesapeake Energy, EOG Resources, ExxonMobil and Anadarko Petroleum as the heaviest users of water.Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is essential for extracting oil and gas from the shale formations that have been responsible for the US boom of the past decade, and it requires large volumes of water: typically 2m gallons or more per well. The water is mixed with sand and chemicals and pumped underground at high pressure to open up cracks in the rock so the oil and gas will flow more freely. The water that flows back out again is often poured away into separate disposal wells.Water shortages can create tensions with local communities and force companies into expensive solutions such as bringing the water to the wells by truck.Monika Freyman of Ceres said water was a risk that was often overlooked. “People don’t worry about it until it’s gone,” she said. “If you are an investor in a company that is in a water-stressed area, you have to ask questions about how it is managing their water risks.”Shareholders including the employee pension funds of New York city and state said this week they would file resolutions for the annual meetings of companies including Exxon, Chevron, EOG and Pioneer Natural Resources, calling for more detailed disclosure of their environmental impact, including water use.Ceres identified Anadarko, Encana, Pioneer and Apache as the companies with the greatest exposure to water risk, meaning the greatest volume of water use in areas with extremely high stress. In those areas, 80 per cent or more of the available water has been committed for other users including homes, farms and businesses.Exxon said XTO, its shale oil and gas subsidiary, “works with local authorities to ensure there is adequate supply.” It added that that coal needing ten times as much water as gas produced through fracking for an equivalent energy content, and corn-based ethanol needed up to 1,000 times as much.Anadarko said it was “on the leading edge” of efforts to manage and conserve water, including recycling it wherever possible, and drawing on a range of sources such as municipal effluent and produced water from oil and gas wells. It is also working with environmental groups and others to develop best practices for water use.Fracking accounts for a relatively small proportion of US water demand: less than 1 per cent even in Texas, according to a University of Texas study, compared to 56 per cent for irrigation. However, in some areas with the greatest oil and gas activity, such as the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas, it can be much more significant.The potential problem in Texas is exacerbated by the protracted drought that has affected the state and the growth in its population caused by the strength of its economy.Jean-Philippe Nicot of the University of Texas said the state’s farmers were using less water for irrigation and shifting to crops that could cope with drier conditions. “More and more water is needed for urban centres, and fracking is part of the picture,” he said.“All the Texas aquifers are heavily taxed right now.”Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, argued in a report last year that the industry would need to address the issue to be able to develop shale oil and gas production around the world, with many of the most promising reserves in China, Africa and the Middle East in areas of water scarcity.Jim Matheson of Oasys Water, a company that develops water treatment technology, predicted an “inexorable but slow” movement towards recycling.“We’re very early in the evolution, but the future is one in which we’re going to have to figure out how to clean and reuse the same water resources,” he said.
39;EOG;Eog Resources;2013-08-11T11:13:28Z;Mid-sized independents riding high on shale oil success;;While it was a downbeat quarter for the majors, things looked much rosier for the midsized independents, which are riding high on a wave of shale oil success.EOG Resources, which has positions in two big shale plays, North Dakota’s Bakken and the Eagle Ford in South Texas, says it is expecting to increase crude oil production by 35 per cent this year.In contrast, ExxonMobil has said its production will fall in 2013 for a second straight year.In many ways the comparison is unfair. EOG has a market value of $42.5bn, while Exxon’s is $406bn. EOG’s production of 506,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day pales into comparison with Exxon’s 4.1m.But that isn’t stopping investors drawing parallels between the two – often to the detriment of the majors.“The smaller companies are beating them into a pulp when it comes to results,” says Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer and Co.EOG is not the only one piquing investors’ interest. Shares in Cabot Oil & Gas, which has operations in the Eagle Ford and Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale, and expects production to grow by as much as 54 per cent this year, have risen 77 per cent over the past 12 months.Oil majors such as Exxon and Shell also have big shale positions. But they seem to be less successful at developing them than the specialised exploration and production companies, or E & Ps. Shell just announced a big writedown of its US shale oil assets.“E & Ps, even very large-cap ones, have greater flexibility to shift corporate strategy in favour of higher returns,” says Eric Gordon of Brown Advisory. He cites the example of Occidental, which late last year slowed down the pace of its investments in the US in order to cut operating and capital costs. The move was successful, improving returns on capital and boosting the company’s share price.In contrast, the majors have seen declining returns amid increasing capital spending and diminishing profit expectations. The market will continue to punish them, he says, until this trend reverses. “In a rising global market, these equities seem doomed for underperformance,” he says.
40;EOG;Eog Resources;2013-01-28T23:42:44Z;Fracking: Industry faces up to hurdle of water pollution;These are, potentially, exciting times for companies that can reduce the environmental risks and the waste, reports Ed Crooks;The recent feature film sounding the alarm about the US natural gas boom, Promised Land, opens with its star Matt Damon washing his face in a bathroom. The film sets out its theme from the start: the greatest source of concern about the extraction of gas from rocks is water pollution.The use of water mixed with sand and chemicals in hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”, has made the shale oil and gas boom possible.The demand for that water – and the disposal of the produced water that emerges from wells after they have been fracked – are at the heart of the debate over whether tighter controls should be imposed on the industry.They are also potentially exciting opportunities for companies that have ways to manage water that are economically efficient and reduce the environmental risks.“Everybody is relying on fracking to make the US more energy independent, but there are major issues with water,” says Riggs Eckelberry, the chief executive of OriginOil, a company that has recently entered the business of water treatment for the oil and gas industry.He adds: “It’s becoming critical to the entire US strategy to do something about this water.”Dennis Danzik, a director of Ridgeline Energy Services, another small company that has been developing water treatment technology, agrees.He says: “Eventually, we’ll need a full waste water treatment policy, or we’ll have the country dotted with quarter-acre ponds. We have to have the energy, so the issue is not going to go away. It has to be dealt with.”A typical deep shale gas well needs 4m-6m gallons of water for hydraulic fracturing, according to a 2011 report from the National Petroleum Council, an advisory group to the US government that includes both industry representatives and environmentalists.That does not make the industry a particularly large user of water. As gas companies like to point out, in terms of water use per unit of energy produced, shale production compares very favourably to other sources such as coal or gas-fired power generation.In some parts of the US, however, water use can be a problem, especially during the drought conditions that have hit much of the country over the past year.Scott Anderson, of the Environmental Defense Fund, who has worked on the issue for the NPC, says there are some counties in Texas where 70 per cent of the growth in water consumption is a result of oil and gas production.Even in states where water is plentiful, it needs to be transported to wells, adding cost and creating disruption for communities that will be plagued by streams of trucks.The more serious problem, however, is the disposal of waste water that emerges with the oil and gas. It includes “flow back” fracking water – between 10 per cent and 70 per cent of water used for fracking comes back out again, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.That water, contaminated with salt and the chemicals used for fracking, needs to be managed. It is generally either pumped into injection wells or sent to plants for treatment.Neither method is ideal. Injection wells have been blamed for causing small earthquakes in Texas and other states, and there have been warnings that in some areas the volume of waste water needing to be stored will overwhelm the available capacity. Standard water treatment plants are not able to handle all the substances in flow back water. In 2010-11 Pennsylvania moved to limit the levels of pollution in waste water that gas producers were able to send to the state’s treatment facilities. Plants were also compelled to monitor for radioactive radium and uranium, which can be present in produced water.The solution for many companies is to treat and reuse water close to the well-site. More companies now offer water treatment technology, including big engineering groups such as General Electric and Siemens, oilfield specialists such as Halliburton, and smaller businesses such as Ecosphere.OriginOil was a specialist in technology for processing algae for biofuel production, but spotted an opportunity in fracking water treatment. It says its process, which it will demonstrate in Texas, will remove 98 per cent of carbon contaminants from waste water.Some processes can be expensive, but Mr Eckelberry says OriginOil’s system, used with further processing, can treat water for as little as 7 cents per gallon, less than the 21-26 cents of other methods and less even than the 11 cents typical cost of a gallon delivered to the well-site by truck.Ridgeline, meanwhile, has reached the point of selling its services to oil and gas producers, including ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources and Devon Energy.Mr Danzik suggests a cost of 1-8 cents per gallon for its electro-catalytic process, compared to about 22-24 cents for rival methods.He also argues that the use of water treatment will have to be much more widespread. Government regulation may also play a part. With the EPA studying the impact of fracking on water resources – its report is due late next year – the industry could face tighter curbs.“Technology can help, but technology alone isn’t a solution,” says Evan Branosky, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank. “We need to better understand the full water risks to inform smart decisions for responsible development of shale gas.”
41;EOG;Eog Resources;2012-01-24T19:00:28Z;Chesapeake tackles oversupply issue;Move may signal others to do same;"Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake Energy’s ebullient chief executive, has a nice turn of phrase when discussing his company’s principal product. Natural gas, he reportedly said, is not oversupplied in the US; it is under-demanded.He has backed that argument with efforts to increase the use of gas for power generation and road transport, extolling its benefits for pollution and energy security.In the face of gas prices that fell last week to a ten-year low, however, Chesapeake accepted that the supply side of the equation would have to move, too. On Monday, it announced a planned 8 per cent cut in gas production and a 67 per cent cut in the number of rigs drilling gas wells, from an average of 75 in use last year to 24 by the second quarter of this year.The market reacted positively to the news, sending the February gas future price up 7.8 per cent on Monday and a further 2.4 per cent on Tuesday morning. Shares in Chesapeake and other US gas companies such as Range Resources, Southwestern Energy and Cabot Oil & Gas also rose.However, analysts believe that for gas prices to mount a sustained recovery, other companies will have to follow Chesapeake’s lead. Producers are likely to remain under pressure from low gas prices, until more of them crack.Chesapeake stands a better chance than most companies of being able to curb US gas output and send prices higher. It is the second-largest producer in the US, accounting for 9 per cent of the country’s gas output and a much higher proportion of the growth over the past decade.Yet even its shift of about 50 rigs away from gas drilling is not enough to cut activity to the point where US gas production begins to fall, according to Mary Barcella of IHS, a consultancy.According to Baker Hughes, the oil and gas services company, there were 780 rigs drilling for gas in the US last week, down from 906 a year ago. Ms Barcella calculates that figure needs to drop below 700 before gas production will fall. Even then, she expects a lag of about five months, as wells that have been drilled and completed are brought on stream.Martin Craighead, Baker Hughes’ chief operating officer, said on Tuesday he expected the gas rig count to keep dropping “until there is a meaningful increase in gas prices”.A few other companies have talked about cutting their investment in gas production. Talisman Energy of Canada has announced a sharp cut in rigs drilling in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Halliburton, another services company, revealed that it was redeploying crews for hydraulic fracturing, used to open up difficult reserves, away from gas production and into oil.The problem for the industry is that every company would prefer that someone else cuts back production.Jeb Armstrong, an analyst at CLSA, describes it as the “classic prisoner’s dilemma”, in which individually rational behaviour has a collectively damaging outcome.”Everyone in the industry knows they need to choke back on production to boost prices, but I don’t think any of the others will follow Chesapeake’s lead and do so,” he says.Other reasonable-sized gas producers such as EOG Resources and Anadarko Petroleum will be reluctant to cut production, he argues.Fadel Gheit, oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer, believes that eventually they will be forced to respond.“There is no compelling reason for companies to keep drilling themselves into bankruptcy …I would expect all large gas producers without exception to scale back production this year.”For many companies, including Chesapeake, a shift to producing oil and natural gas liquids, which earn much higher prices than “dry” gas, will sustain their finances, enabling them to keep on drilling.Liquids production also often produces gas as a byproduct, which will stop supply falling.So while the correction may be inevitable eventually – gas prices are now below the cost of production in parts of the US – timing it will not be easy.Ms Barcella of IHS believes prices are likely to remain around $3 per million British thermal units for the rest of the year; not much higher than today’s level of about $2.50 and a level that will be painful for many producers.“We are in uncharted territory,” she says, “and just feeling our way through it”."
42;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-12-12T17:47:13Z;Argentina poised for shale oil and gas boom;;Argentina could be nearing a shale oil and gas boom similar to the one that transformed the US energy landscape as former state monopoly YPF eyes another 1bn barrel discovery adjacent to a Patagonian field whose reserves were more than six times bigger than thought.YPF has almost finished drilling a 502 sq km area just north of the discovery zone and believes full results will be equally vast. Two of the three wells are in production and “the yield is exactly the same,” says Tomás García Blanco, YPF’s executive director for upstream.Asked if this heralded another 1bn barrel discovery, Mr García Blanco says: “Yes. But until the third well is drilled … I would like to be cautious. We hope to know by the end of the year or January 2012.”The group, which is 57.43 per cent owned by Spain’s Repsol, announced in November that it had discovered 927m barrels of oil equivalent in a 428 sq km zone of the Vaca Muerta (“Dead Cow”) formation in south-western Argentina – more than six times higher than its initial estimate in May of 150m barrels. The discovery is three-quarters oil and one-quarter gas, it says.That, Mr García Blanco notes, is based on “conservative” estimates that only 4 per cent of all the hydrocarbons will be extracted. Some in the US believe recovery rates of 8 per cent or even 15 per cent may be possible in time – something that will lead to eye-popping estimates of the potential for shale worldwide.Argentina has some of the world’s biggest and best-quality reserves of shale hydrocarbons, which are trapped thousands of metres underground and released by fracturing rocks using high-pressured water, sand and chemicals. The US Energy Information Administration this year ranked Argentina third globally in terms of technically recoverable shale gas resources with 774,000bn cubic feet.With the YPF results and intensive exploration by companies with shale experience in North America – such as ExxonMobil, Total, EOG Resources and Apache – Argentina believes it can emulate the US in going from a mature, but declining hydrocarbons producer to a shale superstar.“The flood of companies started six months ago. Now we’re starting to get results,” says Sam Lee, portfolio manager of the $70m Melchior Resources Fund. It has 8 per cent of its assets in Americas Petrogas, which has a shale farm-out deal with Exxon, and some 5 per cent in other junior companies, and sees 2012 as “an inflection year for Argentina’s oil and gas industry”.Hydrocarbons output has nosedived in Argentina in recent years amid market unfriendly policies and heavy regulation of the sector that discouraged investment. As a result, the government expects to import a record 80 cargoes of liquefied natural gas next year, a 20 per cent increase on 2011.But industry observers note that royalties are low relative to other resource-rich countries and Argentina is offering higher prices for shale gas and oil under the Gas Plus and Oil Plus programmes, creating potentially advantageous conditions for a shale boom.Vaca Muerta, which lies at a depth of 2,500m to 3,000m and had been ignored for decades as geologists long considered such rock unproductive, compares favourably to major US shale formations, says Mr García Blanco: it is three times as deep as Eagle Ford in Texas and yields could be double, he believes.“It does seem to have some similarities to some very productive US plays,” agrees Robert Clarke, manager of the unconventional gas service at Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy.YPF remains upbeat that there could there be more shale-rich bedrocks, such as Vaca Muerta in the Neuquén basin. Next year, it plans to spend $40m to drill three wells on the Molles formation, which lies below Vaca Muerta at a depth of 3,500m to 4,000m. “Our expectations are very high,” Mr García Blanco adds.YPF is also looking further south, at the D-129 bedrock in the San Jorge basin, to explore shale potential there, he adds. In all, the company expects to drill 40 shale wells next year, at a cost of $11m to $12m per well.“Until two-and-a half years ago, I thought we would maintain production but never grow in oil, and in gas we would maintain or decline a bit,” Mr García Blanco admits. Now, he reckons that within five years, a third of YPF’s production will come from the Vaca Muerta shale, and the company will be self-sufficient in supplying its refineries.
43;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-12-01T22:15:41Z;Enron: 10 years after;The energy trader’s crimes should not be minimised, but ...;Here’s a take you may not hear elsewhere on the 10th anniversary of Enron’s collapse – the company also left a positive legacy. In some circles that is tantamount to noting that Joseph Stalin had some virtues too, but keep reading.Enron and its leaders utterly transformed the buying and selling of electricity and natural gas, leaving a lasting legacy. This was not out of altruism, of course – it made tremendous (mostly legitimate) profits. Tens of billions of dollars in lasting benefits that trickle down to utility customers were also unlocked through its innovations. This is because risks were taken and infrastructure fully utilised that would not have been otherwise for lack of financial techniques to do so. And, though Enron is blamed for the fallout from energy deregulation such as California’s brownouts and soaring commodity prices, much of the fault lies elsewhere – with shortsighted politicians, for example.So were they really the smartest guys in the room? The evidence certainly is mixed. A decade on, companies formed out of their unwanted assets – such as EOG Resources and Kinder Morgan – are success stories while Messrs Lay, Fastow and Skilling are dead, disgraced and incarcerated, respectively. And companies such as Dynegy and Reliant that mimicked Enron’s swashbuckling, asset-light strategy nearly went bust as a result. But many veterans of the energy trading boom that Enron and its competitors spawned have gone on to make fortunes in hedge funds or run energy trading desks at investment banks. Long after they retire, fat and happy, the innovations they were part of will endure.That is not quite up there with defeating fascism, and Enron’s crimes should not be minimised either. It is a pity, though, that they are conflated with benign market forces even a decade later.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

45;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-10-19T23:40:34Z;British Columbia in race for business in Asia;;The western Canadian province of British Columbia is stepping up efforts to compete more aggressively against Australia for business in Asia, giving priority to construction of a $4.5bn liquefied natural gas export terminal on the Pacific coast.Pat Bell, the provincial cabinet minister spearheading a new job-creation strategy, told the Financial Times that the government was determined to clear away remaining regulatory hurdles so that construction of the Kitimat LNG project could start next year.“I think that will send a very positive signal to investors around the world that we’re open for business and that we can make big projects happen quickly,” he said.Federal regulators approved an export licence last week for the LNG project, owned by Houston-based Apache, EOG Resources and Calgary-based Encana.The project, with an initial capacity of 700m cubic feet a day, includes a pipeline from gas fields in north-east British Columbia. Shipments are due to start in 2015.British Columbia’s moves coincide with a rising concern that Canada risks being left behind in the race for commercial opportunities in China and other fast-growing Asian economies.A report published on Wednesday by the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, a lobby group, concluded that “Canada has a reputation in Asia of showing up there but not being serious about establishing long-term relationships”.Lorraine Mitchelmore, head of Royal Dutch Shell’s Canadian unit, warned last month that Canada lagged far behind Australia in Asian-targeted energy projects. “Every major energy exporting country in the world is going after that market,” she said. “We are the only major oil and gas exporter in the world that does not have access to a global market.”The Kitimat LNG terminal is closer to Asian markets than similar projects in Australia.British Columbia is also seeking to attract more Asian students, partly by capitalising on a series of racial incidents on Australian campuses over the past few years.“It certainly seems to us that [the Chinese] are looking for a new place to send their kids,” Mr Bell said.“Australia has been very aggressive in its international education efforts, so we think there’s a window of opportunity that exists for us.”An estimated 94,000 foreign students, including 20,000 from China, are enrolled at British Columbia schools and universities.Randall Martin, executive director of the British Columbia Council for International Education, a non-profit group that coordinates its foreign marketing, said that “our reputation for safety, tolerance and diversity has stood us in good stead”.Mr Bell said that British Columbia was also seeking Asian investment in large mining projects. “We think they will be of real interest to the Chinese in terms of a long-term offtake opportunity, perhaps the Koreans, the Japanese or the Indians as well.”He cited the Galore Creek copper, gold and silver deposit in north-west British Columbia owned by NovaGold and Teck Resources. Construction was suspended three years ago because of rising costs, but the partners are now in the midst of fresh feasibility studies. NovaGold expressed confidence last week that the project could become one of North America’s biggest copper producers.The government has set up an office to speed up the biggest projects. Mr Bell said that the group had an open agenda item at cabinet meetings. “They will be able to get instantaneous decisions. Their sole mandate will be to move that project forward in a very timely fashion,” he said.
46;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-10-10T16:35:26Z;Pipelines: US advances change rules of the game;Sheila McNulty reports on a shift of market emphasis;Canada has long billed its oil and natural gas resources as a solution to its southern neighbour’s ravenous demand for energy. But the discovery of a way to extract natural gas from tightly packed shale rock has meant the US no longer needs to import as much natural gas.And an environmentalist movement against the high carbon nature of Canada’s oil industry has raised questions about whether there will be big exports to the US as planned.The protests have centred on the proposed Keystone XL– a 2,673km pipeline extension that would start in Alberta and run south-east through Saskatchewan, Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. It would incorporate a portion of the Keystone Pipeline that runs through Nebraska and Kansas to serve Oklahoma and, eventually, Port Arthur in Texas.The pipeline would be the third that imports fuel from Canada’s vast oil sands deposits, also known as tar sands. TransCanada, the pipeline operator, is waiting for the US State Department’s decision by the end of the year whether to let it build the Keystone extension.Roger Ihne, in the energy and resources practice at Deloitte Consulting, says: “Being in the industry, it’s easy for me to see what drives the project. The oil will be produced and consumed somewhere in the world. It is more economic and environmentally friendly to pipe it to the US than ship it to China or elsewhere.”Environmentalists are not only objecting to the higher carbon content of oil sands fuel, but also that the first Keystone pipeline has had a series of spills in its first year of operation. Russ Girling, president of TransCanada, says that nearly all the oil releases over the past 12 months “have been minor – averaging just five to 10 gallons of oil”.Mark Lewis, a partner at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, believes the arguments against the Keystone XL are red herrings. “Since 1972, we’ve been talking about energy security,” he says. “It seems a little silly to turn away this resource from the north.”Nonetheless, there is talk of building a pipeline to the coast to ship out what oil sands fuel the US does not buy. The export project makes sense to Tony Reinsch, senior director in the upstream and gas group at PFC Energy, the consultancy, regardless of what President Obama decides on Keystone XL.“The US and Canada won’t absorb all the oil sands [production] in North America,” Mr Reinsch says.Canada has 170bn barrels of oil sands reserves. The extension was being put forward as an exclusively oil sands development, yet it had other selling points, he says. “While the Keystone XL pipeline will move oil sands product to the Gulf Coast, it will also carry crude from the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota, where production is poised to grow from 400,000 to 700,000 barrels a day to 1.2m.’’He says that neither the industry and environmentalists have paid much attention to this point, presenting the likely passage of the Keystone XL as a debate between jobs and the environment.Yet the US needs to move its crude out of central states as shale oil production rises.Mr Reinsch says: “Right now, access to alternative markets is constrained, noting the differential between West Texas and Brent crude because of the glut of regional crudes in Cushing, Oklahoma.“There is strong industry focus on increasing pipeline access to the Gulf Coast refineries. You don’t want to be constraining US oil production with inadequate pipeline capacity.”On top of that, he says, the pipeline will provide jobs. “Pipelines are one of the few labour-intensive segments of the oil sector,” Mr Reinsch says. “It’s shovel-ready.”The industry’s position is that the project has undergone years of environmental reviews and would be constructed to the highest standards.Regardless of whether the US approves the Keystone XL, he says, Canada was likely to go ahead with at least one of the two proposals being considered for an alternative pipeline to move oil sands production to the west coast for export to Asia.Canada is also rich in natural gas, and a project to export that fuel is under way.Janine McArdle, Apache’s senior vice-president of gas monetisation and president of Kitimat LNG, a project to liquefy and export natural gas from Canada, says the company is in discussions with several north Asian buyers, including China, Japan and South Korea.The project, which is owned by Apache, EOG Resources Canada and Encana, already has its environmental approvals and Apache expects to make its final investment decision in the first quarter of 2012.Initial capacity will be 700,000 thousand cubic feet a day, but there is room to double that to improve the economies of scale, though that would require amending some of the permits.Apache is looking to supply natural gas in contracts running 15 years or longer, with the selling point that it has a “long life and a safe, reliable source of supply”, Ms McArdle says. The company’s view is that Canada must look beyond the US.“Historically, their big export market was the US,” Ms McArdle says. “But shale changed that. We have, in the US been pushing back on imports. It is important for Canada to find another outlet for its resources.”

The index dipped from positive to negative territory late in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve cut US growth forecasts and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent to 12,109.67 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,669.19.According to Investment Company Institute, the last two week were the worst fortnight for equity outflow since May 2010, the week of the flash crash. This did not help the mood in the markets.Wall Street was hurt by a move in the dollar, which edged higher after the Bernanke press conference. This weighed on the industrial, energy and material sectors.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, although these losses were pared somewhat by L-3 Communications, which spiked 4.6 per cent to $86.21 after reports that investors were pushing the defence company to spin off some units.The S&P energy and material sectors were both down 0.4 per cent.In the materials sector, CF Industries was down 2.8 per cent to $142.25 while Allegheny fell 2.5 per cent to $59.91.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.9 per cent to $142.25 while EOG Resources lost 0.8 per cent to $101.34.But the technology sector was the worst performing in the session, led lower by Adobe Systems, the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500.The software company that makes the Photoshop and Illustrator programs for media and internet professionals gave a disappointing earnings forecast, which dragged the stock down 6.3 per cent to $30.01.These losses came despite the fact that the company reported a 54 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings.Many analysts were still upbeat about the software maker in the long term.Analysts at Citigroup said that there were “lots of small things to quibble about” but that the “big picture [was] still bright”.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Autodesk was down 1.5 per cent to $36.47 while Juniper Networks lost 2.4 per cent to $29.53.The S&P technology index was down 0.8 per cent, although losses were pared by strong gains from Jabil Circuit. The electronics contractor was up 3.2 per cent to $19.45 after reporting powerful earnings and a share buy-back.Homebuilders also saw gains after home prices as tracked by the Federal Housing Finance Agency rose 0.8 per cent in April from the previous month, which was better than the 0.3 per cent fall that had been expected. PulteGroup was up 0.4 per cent to $7.49 while DR Horton added 1.4 per cent to $11.54.Consumer staples stocks also suffered, led by Lorillard Tobacco, which was down 1.7 per cent to $110.01.In the previous session, the US Food and Drug Administration released nine warnings on the ill-effects of smoking – combining graphic images and text – that must appear on cigarette packets as well as in advertisements no later than September 2012.The S&P consumer staples index was down, 0.7 per cent.CarMax, the used-car dealer, enjoyed the strongest gains on the S&P 500 after reporting first-quarter earnings up 25 per cent, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares were up 7 per cent to $32.66 as earnings came in at $126.3m, or 55 cents a share, which was ahead of the 47 cents expected.AeroVironment’s fourth-quarter earnings rose 20.6 per cent on a jump in contract-services, leaving shares in the maker of unmanned aircraft up 19.6 per cent to $34.51.
48;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-05-27T20:47:17Z;Commodity prices buoy Wall Street;;Upbeat guidance from Marvell Technology Group lifted the technology sector, while in the wider markets positive data on consumer sentiment and some firmer commodity prices helped Wall Street to pare nearly all of the losses suffered during another lacklustre week.The maker of chips for personal computers and mobile phones released disappointing first-quarter results, reporting a 29 per cent drop in earnings, but the strong forecast encouraged investors and the stock was up 11.1 per cent to $16.17.This helped lift related equities and Broadcom, another chipmaker, was up 5.4 per cent to $36.52, one of the best performing stocks on the S&P 500. Broadcom was also helped by news that FBR Capital Markets had added the stock to its “top picks” list.Cree, which makes LED and semiconductor materials, gained 4.9 per cent to $43.61 while the Philadelphia semiconductor index put on 1.1 per cent.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,331.11, with the index helped by gains for material stocks as commodity prices were broadly higher.But these gains were not enough to save the measure from falling 0.2 per cent overall over the five day period, the fourth straight week of losses on the index.This was the first time since June 2008 that the index went an entire month with no up weeksThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 0.3 per cent on Friday to 12,441.481, was still down 0.6 per cent over the week.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent to 2,796.86 in the session, down 0.2 per cent over the five days.On Friday, the materials sector saw the sharpest gains. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner by market capitalisation, added 2.7 per cent to $51.73 and Peabody Energy rose 1.6 per cent to $62.62. The S&P materials index added 1 per cent, up 2.1 per cent in the past five days.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, was down 0.3 cent to $84.72 as the oil price turned into negative territory in late trading.The S&P energy sector still added 0.2 per cent in the session, however, up 2 per cent over the week.The broad-based gains on Friday came as investors shrugged off terrible housing data and mixed consumer spending data, choosing to focus on the upturn in consumer confidence. Pending home sales plunged 11.6 per cent in April, which was much worse than the 0.9 per cent fall that economists had been expecting.Separate data said that personal consumption expenditure was up 0.4 per cent in April, below the 0.5 per cent that had been forecast by economists.But the Michigan index of consumer sentiment showed that consumers were more optimistic in May than they had been for three months.The consumer sentiment data was a relief to investors, as it went against the recent trend of weak economic news. The raft of disappointing news this month has helped bring about the four straight weeks of losses on the S&P 500.For example, in the previous session, the commerce department said that consumption growth in the first quarter was weaker than it previously thought and it also dashed hopes that national gross domestic product for the first quarter would be revised upwards from 1.8 per cent.“We are in a downward trend and most likely it will continue,” said Scott O’Neil, president of MarketSmith and portfolio manager with O’Neil Data Systems, reflecting the downbeat tone that is in fashion across much of Wall Street.“The best place to be right now is cash,” he said.The week on Wall Street began with sharp losses on Monday as slack global growth figures created fresh doubts over earnings estimates for the next quarter and added to the general sense of malaise.The S&P 500 has fallen 2.2 per cent this month.The losses on Monday left the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq below their 50-day moving averages. In the later half of the week the indices sought to reclaim these technical levels and the markets saw modest gains.One of the most widely-discussed events of the week was the initial public offering of Yandex, the Russian search engine, as it ties into a broader excitement about technology IPOs.On the first day of trading, the Russian group did not disappoint, and was up as much as 144 per cent. The stock settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its IPO price.But the stock has lost 11.3 per cent this week to $34.45 after its first day of trading.
49;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-05-06T21:47:28Z;Wall Street rallies on US jobs;;A volatile week on Wall Street ended on a high note after better than expected employment data pulled investor sentiment from the doldrums and helped energy and materials stocks rebound.Materials stocks saw some of the strongest gains of the session with the S&P materials index up 0.7 per cent, helping to pare some of the 4.5 per cent losses seen earlier in the week due to falling commodity prices.Material stocks had taken a particular battering on Thursday as commodity prices suffered their sharpest one-day fall since the financial crisis.But on Friday, investors speculated that the losses may have been overdone, and the sector rebounded. Cliff Natural Resources was up 1 per cent to $88.93 while Alcoa, the aluminium producer, added 0.8 per cent to $17.15.These gains helped the wider markets snap a four-day losing streak. The S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent to 1,340.20, still leaving the benchmark index 1.7 per cent lower over the week, however.Sentiment was lifted in the session by strong employment data. The crucial non-farm payroll figures from the labour department showed that 244,000 jobs had been added last month in the US, ahead of the 185,000 that had been expected by economists.The data showed that the government’s work force had fallen in April but that the private sector had more than taken up the slack, adding 268,000 jobs. The unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points to 9 per cent.These data were particularly market moving because a key reason for the losses on Wall Street earlier in the week had been worries that the non-farm payroll numbers would be sluggish.Because of this, the S&P 500 index jumped 1.2 per cent following the figures.But the markets then pared some of these gains after a report in a German newspaper that Greece was considering leaving the eurozone and abandoning the single currency.The S&P energy index was 2.3 per cent higher following the jobs report, paring some of the 7.3 per cent in losses seen earlier in the week, but the index was only 0.4 per cent higher at the close because of the speculation over Greece.In the energy sector, EOG Resources was up 2.3 per cent to $117.44, helped by healthy earnings numbers. Elsewhere in the sector, ConocoPhillips rose 1.4 per cent to $72.94 while Tesoro added 2.6 per cent to $24.91.A number of positive earnings reports also helped to lift sentiment. Shares in Kraft Foods were up 2.1 per cent to $34.08 as the food group reported a rise in revenue and margins.Elsewhere, Visa reported a 24 per cent increase in profits as a result of higher consumer spending and the stock was up 0.9 per cent to $79.41.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 per cent to 12,638.81 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,827.56. The indices were down 1.3 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively over the five days.The markets had opened on Monday in positive territory as the news on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed prompted a “risk on” trade across the world. But this quickly fizzled out as investors turned their attention to more prosaic matters and began to worry that the market was overbought following the technical highs reached in previous sessions.Late in April, the S&P index achieved a 35-month high, the Nasdaq rose to a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.The sense that the market was overheating was also compounded by weak economic data throughout much of the week. As well as lacklustre employment data on Wednesday and Thursday, the ISM non-manufacturing index showed a sharp decrease in the rate of growth in the US service sector in April.Earnings also failed to give the same lift to the markets as the number of companies beating expectations fell back.Two weeks after the start of the earnings season in early April, 80 per cent of companies had beaten analysts’ expectations with their quarterly earnings results. At the end of April, the positive surprise rate was 76 per cent, but now the rate stands at 73 per cent, with slightly less than 100 companies left to report.But the biggest drags on the S&P index over the week were energy and materials stocks as the correction in commodity prices gathered steam. The S&P energy index was down 7 per cent over the week while the S&P material index lost 3.8 per cent.
50;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-03-22T20:35:09Z;US stocks pause for breath after 3-day rally;;Walgreen tumbled after reporting disappointing second-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets traders paused for breath following three straight sessions of strong gains.Shares in Walgreen, the largest pharmacy chain in the US by sales, lost 6.6 per cent to $39.21 after reporting earnings that only met analysts expectations.Investors had been hoping for better margins and same-store sales growth, but this failed to materialise. The stock suffered its sharpest one-day fall since December 2008 and was the worst performer on the S&P 500 index.CVS Caremark, another pharmacy chain, was down 0.9 per cent to $33.41 while the S&P retail index was down 0.7 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 edged 0.4 per cent lower to 1,293.77 in a low-volume session, as traders paused to take stock of the recent rally that has seen the S&P index pare nearly all of the losses sustained following the earthquake in Japan.Fears of a nuclear catastrophe following the natural disaster left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in the first three days of last week. But as these worries subsided traders sought to pick up bargains pushing the S&P close to pre-tsunami levels.“The market wants to climb higher as the data show the US economy is largely on the right track,” said Harvey Neiman, manager of the Neiman Largecap Value Fund. “But every time we get a good run some disaster hits and we see a lot of volatility,” he added.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, spiked up 46.4 per cent early last week following the earthquake and tsunami, but has also calmed down as fears have eased. The index was down 2.4 per cent in the session, adding to the 29.9 per cent decline in the last few days. The measure of fear on Wall Street is back where it was before the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan.US equities have largely recovered from the effects of Japan, but the S&P 500 is still down 3.7 per cent since before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East in February. The Vix is up 22.5 per cent in the same timeframe.The 3.7 per cent loss on the S&P has been the first substantial retreat since Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his speech at Jackson Hole in late August 2010, where he hinted that the Fed would support financial markets with a renewed bond-buying program.The market subsequently gained 28 per cent in 5½ months until the rally was derailed by the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. “The market was in a position where it needed a correction,” said Robert Haber, the chief executive officer of Haber Trilix Advisors. “But there is a pretty good chance we have seen the short-term lows,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,018.63 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,683.87.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Jefferies Group, the investment bank, reported first-quarter earnings up 21 per cent in what the bank said was the second most profitable quarter on record. Shares in the company had added 4.6 per cent in early trading, but ended just 0.2 per cent higher at $24.48.Anadarko Petroleum signed a $1.55bn deal with the Korea National Oil Corporation for one-third of its interest in the Maverick Basin assets in Texas.The deal, which is the second-largest purchase of US oil and natural gasfields this year, will see KNOC pay all of Anadarko’s 2011 capital costs in the basin and then 90 per cent of costs subsequently until the $1.55bn is spent. The news sent shares in Anadarko up 1 per cent to $80.79.Elsewhere in the sector Newfield Exploration, the US oil group, was up 0.5 per cent to $75.58 while EOG Resources added 1.8 per cent to $113.36.Shares of Dollar General, the retailer, rose 1.5 per cent to $30.84 after the retailer reported that fourth-quarter earnings per share had more than doubled to 64 cents from 26 cents in the same period last year.Netflix gained 4 per cent to $221.39 following a note from Credit Suisse entitled “Don’t Stop Believing,” which upgrades the stock from “neutral” to “outperform”.Sprint Nextel, the number three US wireless carrier, was up 2.3 per cent to $4.47 following a 13.6 per cent loss in the previous session on news that AT&T was buying T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom.
51;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-02-14T21:45:42Z;Wall Street edges higher on deal activity;;General Electric’s announcement that it was making an energy acquisition worth $2.8bn lifted oil services stocks and helped the wider markets rise to new 30-month highs.The biggest US industrial group by market capitalisation said it was buying the well support arm of John Wood Group, the UK oil services company.The news sent shares in GE up 0.8 per cent to $21.50 and helped lift oilfield services stocks. Cameron International, which makes oil-and-gas pressure control equipment, was up 4.1 per cent to $58.84 while Schlumberger was up 2.3 per cent to $92.22. The S&P oilfield services sector added 2.1 per cent.The wider energy sector also gained as energy prices ticked up on news that China’s trade surplus had fallen to its lowest level in nine months, indicating strong domestic demand.EOG Resources, a natural gas company, was up 1.6 per cent to $104.90 while Denbury Resources, an oil and gas company, added 5.4 per cent to $22.52. The S&P energy index was up 2.1 per cent.Materials stocks saw strong gains as metal prices also rose. Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was up 4.9 per cent to $56.14 while Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coal miner, added 5.9 per cent to $92.67. The S&P materials index was up 1 per cent.This helped the S&P 500 close 0.2 per cent higher to 1,332.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,268.19 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,817.18.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters was up 6.7 per cent to $46.35 on rumours that it was in talks with Starbucks over a potential partnership. Starbucks was up 0.8 per cent to $33.60.In more concrete deal news, EchoStar, one of the largest satellite television companies in the US, agreed to buy Hughes Communications, a broadband satellite services provider, for about $2bn including assumed debt.Hughes Communications lost 3.7 per cent to $59.47 while EchoStar was up 3.2 per cent to $30.84.Elsewhere Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, the US private equity group, said it was buying Emergency Medical Services at a sharp discount to its current share price. Shares in Emergency Medical Services were down 11 per cent to $62.92 following an offer that, at $64 a share, was a 9.4 per cent discount to Friday’s closing price.The offer price, however, is still 19 per cent above the share price in early December, before EMS said it was looking at strategic alternatives.This string of mergers and acquisition news follows on from heavy deal activity in the previous week. Last Monday, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn while Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, also agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn. NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, announced last week that it was in advanced merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.Retail stocks lost ground in the session after JPMorgan Chase cut its recommendation on Walmart Stores from “overweight” to “neutral”. The world’s largest retailer by sales was down 1.6 per cent to $54.80.That weighed on related stocks. Macy’s was down 3.1 per cent to $23.87 while Sears fell 2.1 per cent to $89.29. The S&P consumer services index was 0.5 per cent lower.Equities across the S&P 500 index fell slightly after President Barack Obama announced $1,100bn in deficit reductions over a 10-year period in his 2012 budget.Netflix, the video rental and streaming service, was up 7.1 per cent to $247.55 after strong data from Nielsen, the media measurement group.MGM Resorts International was down 3 per cent to $15.07 after reporting lower fourth-quarter earnings at most of its Las Vegas resorts and declining casino revenue.Seahawk Drilling was down 41.1 per cent to $4.65 after announcing late on Friday that it was filing for bankruptcy protection.The company said it would sell its fleet of offshore drilling rigs to Hercules Offshore for $105m. Hercules was up 18 per cent to $4.27.Investors continued to react negatively to news that Nokia had entered into a “broad strategic partnership” with Microsoft. Nokia, which fell 14 per cent on Friday, was down 6 per cent to $8.84 while Microsoft was down 0.1 per cent to $27.23.
52;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-02-03T21:13:15Z;Rally in oil prices powers energy stocks to gains;The question now is how much fuel remains in the tank;The soaring price of crude oil has landed investors owning energy stocks with a dilemma.Since last August, the price of Brent, the North Sea benchmark, has risen 40 per cent to more than $100 a barrel. The S&P 500’s energy sector has, in turn, rallied 45 per cent.Among the 41 companies that comprise the S&P energy group, 35 are up more than 20 per cent. The best performer since August has been Massey Energy, with a gain of 95 per cent, while the laggard, EOG Resources, is still up 4.1 per cent.The question after such a stunning rally is how much fuel remains in the tank for further gains.“The big worry is that energy stocks can become a victim of their own success,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “If the price of oil goes too high, too fast, it can hurt the economy.”That was certainly the case in 2008, when oil prices topped out at $147 a barrel in July, before the world economy was hit by the financial crisis and slid into recession.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, admits he is torn over the energy sector. The firm cut recently its holding to “market weight” from “overweight”.“Energy stocks have done so well in such a short period of time and we have made good money in the sector. Now I’m debating whether we should go to ‘underweight’, but part of me is not so sure,” he says.There is certainly a case to be made that energy stocks are due for a pullback of some sort, but much depends on whether oil prices keep rising.Based on price-to-sales comparisons versus the overall market, Mr Ablin estimates the energy sector is 19 per cent above its median for the past 15 years. That looks high, but in 2008 and 2009, the ratio was much higher.One reason for Mr Paulsen’s uncertainty over energy stocks is that in the past year the price of oil has fallen against that of other commodities, such as gold, copper and grains.“As [well] as oil stocks have done, the price of oil should be around $120 a barrel if it had kept pace with commodity prices in general,” he says.Other investors are betting that the oil price, while not as astronomical as some commodities, will remain elevated over the next few years and thus provide a fertile environment for energy stocks to keep increasing in value.“Oil service stocks, particularly, have been benefiting from steadily high prices, prompting major companies to bring on more projects and spend more on exploration around the world,” says Nick Koutsoftas, a portfolio manager at GE Asset Management.Schlumberger, the largest oil services group, is up 60 per cent since last August, while Halliburton has gained 66 per cent.Mr Koutsoftas says he thinks oil prices will remain above $85 a barrel over the next five years because, among other things, “new oil is coming from harder-to-reach places and so the marginal cost for producers is increasing”.Yet while the underlying price of oil plays a major role in the valuation of stocks in the sector, there are concerns over valuations, particularly for gas companies, which are trading at very high prices based on their expected earnings.“I do worry about some valuations for gas companies,” Michael Kay, oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, says. Companies such as Pioneer Energy trade at a price-to-earnings multiple of 158 times, with Range Resources at 96 and Cabot Oil & Gas at 36 times.Gas groups such as these benefit from being growth companies, with successful exploration strikes transforming their bottom line.By comparison, ExxonMobil, the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalisation of $416bn, is already up 13 per cent this year and trades at 13.2 times prospective 2011 earnings.For some investors, staying in the energy sector is a bet that still looks good even if they would not come into the market for the first time now. “You have to enjoy the wave and, while it’s too expensive to enter now, we will hold energy stocks until they break down,” Mr Ablin says.
53;EOG;Eog Resources;2011-01-13T18:38:59Z;Marathon splits off refineries from exploration;;"Marathon Oil, the fourth-biggest integrated US oil and gas company, is to split into two by separating its refinery and pipeline operations from its exploration and production business.The move, which sent Marathon’s share price up $3.31, more than 8 per cent, to $43.84, joins a flurry of demergers of US groups including one announced by industrial conglomerate ITT this week. Marathon Petroleum – a newly-created company – will be the fifth-biggest refiner in the US; while Marathon Oil will focus solely on global exploration and production, with growth leveraged to crude oil production.David Pursell, head of Macro Research at Tudor Pickering Holt, the energy investment and merchant banking firm, said that as an integrated group, Marathon has had difficulty standing out.It is too small for investors to consider it a rival to other integrated groups, such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell. The split will allow each company to act in the best interest of its business segment, better attract talent and allow for more specific comparisons against competitors.Marathon’s exploration and production business can now be compared against companies such as EnCana and EOG Resources. Its refining business can be measured against pure refiners, such as Valero.“The market clearly likes the announcement,’’ Mr Pursell said.“This is a vote of confidence for other companies with similar assets to follow.’’Investors have supported other splits, including that by EnCana in 2009 and Questar in 2010. There has been talk of BP and ConocoPhillips demerging but analysts say the effort is more difficult and offers less value for companies of their scale.Marathon’s decision to split follows a long period of consideration that ended two years ago with a decision to remain integrated amid the financial crisis. “The substantial improvement in the global business and financial environments over the past two years has created the conditions under which we believe it is now appropriate to move forward with the formation of two strong independent energy companies,’’ said Clarence Cazalot Jr, Marathon president and chief executive.Marathon’s market value at Wednesday’s closing price was about $28.8bn. The company plans to distribute one share of Marathon Petroleum for every two shares of Marathon Oil. Marathon Oil will pay an initial divided of 15 cents per quarter, based on about 710m shares outstanding, and Marathon Petroleum will pay 20 cents per quarter, based on about 355m shares outstanding.The spin-off is expected to be tax-free and effective from June 30.Moody’s Investors Service placed Marathon’s Baa1 senior unsecured bond rating under review for possible downgrade, noting that the split would reduce scale and eliminate benefits of integration. Morgan Stanley is acting as financial adviser, Baker Botts as legal adviser and Bingham McCutchen as tax adviser."
54;EOG;Eog Resources;2010-12-07T19:49:16Z;US independents to buy into shale oil boom;;Plunging US natural gas prices are pushing independents that have long focused on gas to buy into the shale oil boom.To finance the switch they are selling their traditional businesses to cash-rich foreigners or international oil companies that can afford to wait for the rebound in gas prices.The independents have also to search for shale oil acreage, which is growing increasingly expensive with the rush to use new technology and expertise to reach this long-ignored resource.Yet companies have a strong motive to make the transition, says Raoul LeBlanc, senior director at PFC Energy, the consultancy. An mcf (thousand cubic feet) of US natural gas has historically sold for a tenth of the price of a barrel of oil, he says. But now that gap has widened and one mcf of gas is selling for one twentieth or even less of the price of a barrel of oil.“Almost everyone went too heavily into gas, thinking it was nirvana,” says Mr LeBlanc. “Everybody is trying to make a shift now. But like the Three Stooges all trying to go through a door, they can’t all fit.”Gary Flaharty, vice-president of investor relations at Baker Hughes, said the number of rigs focused on drilling for oil in the US had gone from 180 in May 2009, a low point, to 720 in November 2010. He expects that number to grow in 2011 as gas-directed drilling stays flat.EOG was among the first gas-focused independents to see the potential and in 2008 began snapping up acreage in the liquids-rich portions of the Bakken shale of North Dakota and Eagle Ford shale in Texas ahead of its competitors.The company projects that it will have gone from deriving 23 per cent of its north America revenue from liquids and 77 per cent dry gas in 2007 to 67 per cent liquids and 33 per cent dry gas by 2011.Even tiny companies are turning to oil. Nick Atencio, chief executive and director of Mainland Resources, a six-man company that has until now been focused on shale gas, is planning to try its hand at producing oil from shale in some new acreage picked up in Mississippi. “We’re just getting into it right now,” he says.Deals continue to be struck. Williams, a gas transport and production company, announced last month that it would pay $925m to an undisclosed seller for shale oil acreage in North Dakota’s Bakken formation.“If they don’t have an oil or liquids footprint, they’re trying to get one,” says Jon Wolff, a managing director at Credit Suisse.“There are countless examples.”Yet many independents are too strapped for cash to make the transition, given low cash flows from their dry gas-producing assets.The shale gas boom has pushed down US gas prices to the $3-$4 per million British thermal units range, from the 2008 record high of $13.69 per mBtu. Meanwhile, the rush to shale oil has pushed prices as high as $12,000 per acre in some areas, up from the $300 it was fetching just two years ago.To fund the switch, the independents must sell dry gas acreage, Mr Wolff said, noting this is something Range Resources, PetroHawk and EOG, have all announced plans to do.EOG said last month it would sell a portion of its Marcellus shale position to Newfield Exploration for $405m as part of efforts to unload $1bn of dry gas assets by year-end.Mr Wolff says those still keen to buy dry gas acreage are companies that can wait for prices to rebound.Chevron, the US’s second biggest oil and gas company, is a good example. It has just paid $4.3bn to buy Atlas Energy, which has a strong position in the Marcellus shale, a giant, dry gas field.Those with stronger balance sheets, such as Devon Energy, are hanging on to dry gas assets while they reposition rigs in liquids-rich areas.It plans to spend about 90 per cent of its capital expenditure on oil- and liquids-rich drilling next year. Devon expects capital expenditure for exploration and production to be between $4.5bn and $4.9bn, subject to board approval.
55;EOG;Eog Resources;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Gulf course;Big oil has not written off the Gulf of Mexico, despite the BP spill;It is no accident that companies packed with geologists seem to make their decisions using the geological timescale. The world’s truly big oil and gas prospects can be so technically daunting that evaluating them may take a decade and exploitation decades more. In that context, the Macondo spill – and the higher safety costs and legal liabilities it has brought – come to a mere speed bump for a region as promising as the Gulf of Mexico.Chevron’s announcement on Thursday of a $7.5bn investment in some of the deepest fields ever explored in Gulf waters should be the first of many signs that big oil has not written off the region. On the contrary, the stricter rules and unfamiliar geology of reserves lsuch as the huge Lower Tertiary age deposits that Chevron, Shell and others are targeting may leave supermajors more dominant than ever. Mid-major EOG Resources may be the first of many seeking to divest its Gulf holdings. Speculation that BP would offload its Gulf acreage remains just that.As chaotic and arbitrary as Washington’s knee-jerk response to the Gulf disaster has been, the US remains one of the least politically risky places in the world to search for oil. America is also one of the few places on earth where the supermajors (a title they no longer really deserve) are not forced into playing second fiddle to national oil companies, if they are allowed to participate at all.Even in some developing countries that let the old big oil play a leading role, capricious regimes can dictate new terms – potentially reducing returns on billions in fixed investment.There is risk and then there is risk. The oil companies’ willingness to tackle projects as technically complex as the one Chevron announced is a sign that while the US legal and political systems may keep them up at night, the worst nightmares are elsewhere.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
56;EOG;Eog Resources;2010-10-18T01:31:47Z;Low US gas prices to reshape industry;;Low US natural gas prices intensify pressure on producers, with analysts expecting many to form joint ventures and to sell off assets to raise cash.Prices have been trading at about $3-$4 per million British thermal units (mBtu) in recent months, down from the record $13.69 per mBtu reached in 2008. Raoul LeBlanc, senior director at PFC Energy, the consultancy, said that investors have revised down next year’s projected prices from $6-$7 per mBtu to $4-$5 per mBtu.“People are pretty bad off,” Mr LeBlanc said. Some continue to drill because leases require it in order to retain rights to the land. Others are producing at these prices because they are desperate for cash given heavy loads of debt.Yet some can no longer warrant drilling, he said, and are laying down their rigs. “We are beginning to see signs of slowing from select natural gas-focused producers,” said Credit Suisse Equity Research in a new report.It noted that SandRidge had dropped from eight rigs to one in the Pinon Field of West Texas, and that Chesapeake said that it would reduce the rigs it had been running to hold leases from about 45 to 30 by year-end 2011.Petrohawk Energy signalled that it was open to letting leases expire to preserve capital, the report said. EOG Resources said that it would let certain non-core leases expire.“There are a lot of companies looking to farm down acreage,’’ said Luke Parker, manager of Wood Mackenzie’s M&A research service. But buyers continue to show interest. Companies spent a record $21bn on acquisitions in the first half of 2010 to access the US shale gas boom, says Wood Mackenzie.Chesapeake, the US’s biggest gas driller, has been most active in finding partners to bankroll production.It has done deals with the UK’s BP, Total of France, Norway’s Statoil and Cnooc, the state-owned Chinese energy company. Cnooc agreed this month to buy 33 per cent of Chesapeake’s Eagle Ford oil and gas shale acreage in Texas for $1.08bn. A day earlier, Statoil and Talisman Energy of Canada joined in a $1.3bn deal to buy area assets from Enduring Resources for $10,900 per acre.So long as these companies pay top dollar, production will continue, analysts say, and the current glut in the market will not be cleared. The vicious cycle will keep pressure on companies to sign more deals with those who can afford to keep production going.“There is a lot of capital available to companies to maintain drilling activity,’’ said George Shiau, portfolio manager at hedge fund Copia Capital.
57;EOG;Eog Resources;2010-09-28T18:16:50Z;US energy firms rush into shale oil projects;;"A band of entrepreneurial oilmen have found an economic way to extract oil from shale rock, fuelling a frenzy for prospects that has pushed up lease prices and lifted hopes of the first rise in onshore US oil production in decades.Mineral leases in shale oil territory that would have sold for $10 an acre in the Niobrara Shale – which runs under parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming – just two years ago are going for $5,900 an acre, according to Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy.These small independent oilmen had used hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to triple estimates of US natural gas supplies and are now applying that same technology to get oil from shale rock.“Oil shale is booming,” says Raoul LeBlanc, senior director at PFC Energy, the consultancy.The process, used by EOG Resources, Continental Resources and Brigham Exploration, among others, involves drilling 10,000 feet down and then 10,000 feet across and pumping in water, in up to 40 stages, at high pressures to fracture the rock and let the oil escape.The method could add 1m barrels of oil a day to US supplies in five to eight years, says Pete Stark, vice-president of industry relations for IHS Cera, the consultancy.After decades of falling onshore oil production, Mr Stark says this marks the first time the US could see a “significant increase” in onshore oil production: “It’s a very big plus for the US economy and energy security. It’s new jobs, and it could offset 1m barrels per day of imports.”The US imports about 10m barrels a day of oil, so that would be replacing 10 per cent of imports.The growth estimates lead Jeremy Boak, director of the Center for Oil Shale Technology and Research at the Colorado School of Mines, to cast doubt on claims that the US had reached its peak in oil
discoveries: “There is oil to be found in the United States.”The predicted 1m barrels a day would add to a base of about 3m a day, much of it from the Bakken shale, which covers most of North Dakota and part of Montana.The US Geological Survey estimated in 2008 that the area has from 3bn to 4.3bn barrels of undiscovered oil technically recoverable with the new technology. That is a 25-fold increase over its 1995 estimate of 151m barrels of oil and now represents the US’s biggest oilfield outside Alaska.This year, the North Dakota Geological Survey estimated almost 2bn barrels of recoverable oil from the nearby Three Forks-Sanish zone of the Bakken, increasing total resource potential to more than 6bn barrels.Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, notes only one-third of US oil has been considered recoverable, given technology limitations. Success in the Bakken underlines the potential to recover more of those “unrecoverable resources”.“We’re using all the technology available to us today,” he says. “Will there be further advancements? Absolutely.”Lance Langford, executive vice-president of operations for Brigham Exploration, says the company intends to produce the field for the next 30 to 40 years: “We’re just getting started.”With operational costs in the Gulf of Mexico to rise following BP’s accident, Mr LeBlanc expects interest in these shale prospects will grow. Other fields, such as the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and the Niobrara Shale are now being targeted.“We'll see a doubling of the rig count in the next two years,” says Jon Wolff, a managing director at Credit Suisse Securities.Wood Mackenzie estimates shale oil extraction is profitable at $50 a barrel, far below the current $70 price, so even tiny companies are investing."
58;EOG;Eog Resources;2010-06-09T18:48:52Z;Industry feels the grip of tighter controls;;US regulators are taking an increasingly firm grip on oil and gas companies, with repercussions of the Gulf spill being felt as far away as Pennsylvania.The state has barred EOG Resources, a natural gas company, from completing drilling operations for 30 days on wells in the state after a June 3 blow-out. The incident sent natural gas and at least 132,600 litres of drilling wastewater into the sky and over the ground for 16 hours. No one was killed or injured, but the authorities are investigating the blast and EOG’s entire drilling operations. EOG says it “regrets this incident’’ and is co-operating.John Hanger, secretary of Pennsylvania’s department of environmental protection, said he wanted to send a message to doublecheck processes, equipment and personnel. “I’m hoping the industry, and the companies in it, are pausing and asking the tough questions.’’This message is being delivered in more subtle ways in different states. And while most in the industry seem to accept a tightening of regulations for the offshore deepwater gulf, the worry is that the crackdown will go too far.One company tells of regulators asking workers to increase drying time of cement on a well to 12 hours from the normal eight. A meeting with regulators over a minor matter that might have once been settled in a 30-minute telephone call is being done in person and requiring hours.Another says state authorities have asked companies to submit detailed reporting on concrete and how it was prepared, poured and tested on wells.Some fear Congress will get involved rewriting regulations. Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, US’s biggest oil and gas company, addressed this point at the annual shareholders meeting on May 26. “I think it’s important before anyone jumps to the conclusion that the regulations were inadequate or that the procedures are inadequate until we know exactly what the cause of the incident was.’’The authorities have imposed a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling and issued on Tuesday stronger safety requirements for operating in the shallow and deep waters of the Gulf. They include certification by the chief executive that operations are in compliance with regulations and equipment has been tested, personnel properly trained and procedures reviewed.Greg Kerley, chief financial officer of Southwestern Energy and a panellist, told the conference, “The news of the last several months, in general, does not bode well for legislative oversight going forward.’’
59;EOG;Eog Resources;2009-09-08T20:32:49Z;Wall Street bolstered by commodities prices;;"US stocks climbed higher for the third day on Tuesday after rising commodity prices and renewed merger and acquisition activity bolstered investor confidence.“While recent momentum has been positive, the continuing theme of the last few sessions has been one of regaining recent losses and ongoing consolidation rather than the start of a new bull trend,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC markets.The S&P 500 ended the day 0.9 per cent higher at 1,025.39 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq also rose 0.9 per cent to 2,037.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 9,497.34.From the opening bell, the materials and energy sectors led the market after oil prices rose and the gold price crept above the psychologically significant $1,000 level.United States Steel gained 2.2 per cent to $43.28 while ExxonMobil rose 2.1 per cent to $70.65.The industrials index was buoyed by General Electric. Its shares rose 4.5 per cent to $14.5 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock.EOG Resources, the oil and gas producer, also climbed 4.5 per cent to $73.64 after Barron’s, the influential investor magazine, said the company may benefit as it shifts from natural gas to potentially more lucrative oil production.Investor confidence was further boosted by a flurry of M&A activity, which has slumped during the recession.Shares in Intellon, the semiconductor company, surged 42.4 per cent to $7.12 after Atheros Communications agreed to buy the company for $244m in cash and stock. Atheros, which makes wireless communications chips for Hewlett-Packard computers, fell 2 per cent to $27.43.Kraft Foods, the biggest food group in the US, fell 5.9 per cent to $26.45 after its £10.2bn ($16.7bn) takeover bid for Cadbury was rejected on Monday.Hershey rose 1.3 per cent to $39.13 on speculation that it could also put itself forward in the bidding war for Cadbury, which produces chocolate bars such as Flake and Wispa as well as chewing gum.The British company has vowed to mount a staunch defence against the unsolicited takeover offer, which comes in the middle of rapid consolidation in the confectionery industry.Elsewhere in the consumer industry, Smithfield Foods, the pork processor, reported a first-quarter loss of $107.7m compared with a loss of $13.2m last year.The company blamed its deteriorating performance on concerns over swine flu and weaker demand for pork. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $12.75.Costco Wholesale, the biggest warehouse club chain in the US, added 2.3 per cent to $56.73 after two broker upgrades.Its membership-only stores, which sell branded food, household and electronic products, have been picking up business as
middle-class Americans seek to save money by buying groceries and other essentials in bulk.The tech sector was buoyed by a report from Morgan Stanley, which raised the US systems and PC hardware sector to “attractive” from “in line”.Apple rose 1.6 per cent to $172.93 after the company raised its price target from $195 to $200.Although Dell was one of the companies that was downgraded by Morgan Stanley, it benefited from the sector’s momentum,
rising 1.7 per cent to $15.96.IBM was also downgraded and lost 0.3 per cent to $117.16, even though the group said it was “well ahead” of its plan of achieving earnings per share of $10 to $11 for 2010.The healthcare sector was the only S&P 500 index group in the red.Health insurance stocks continued to suffer ahead of President Barack Obama’s address to Congress today, when he is expected to
outline his proposed reforms of the healthcare system.WellPoint, one of the largest US health insurers, fell 4.3 per cent to $51.84. UnitedHealth Group fell 3.6 per cent to $27.84.A report late in the day showing US consumer credit had dropped by more than forecast did little damage to the day’s rally. According to the Federal Reserve, consumer credit fell by $21.6bn in July, compared to a revised decline of $15.5bn in June."
60;EOG;Eog Resources;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
