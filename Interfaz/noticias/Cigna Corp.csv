But New York Life’s $6.3bn swoop for Cigna’s life and disability insurance business on Wednesday underscores the pressure on US life insurers to find new sources of growth.Life insurance companies profit from investing premiums paid by policyholders until the claims are due. The Federal Reserve’s about-face on interest rates this year has depressed bond yields, making it considerably harder for insurers to meet their liabilities. Yield on investment grade corporate bonds has fallen by over 130 basis points to 2.92 per cent since the start of the year, according to the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexThis makes underwriting the businesses that do not promise a guaranteed return attractive. One example is pet insurance company PetFirst Healthcare. It was snapped up by MetLife, the biggest US life-insurer by market value, earlier this month. Another is the Cigna unit that New York Life is buying. Its accident, disability and life insurance plans are sold to companies to offer to their employees.Demand for these policies is growing as ageing workers look to protect themselves. Cigna’s unit generated around $4.1bn in premiums and fees in 2017, up nearly a third from five years ago.New York Life had to stump up to seal the deal, beating other bidders. It is paying the equivalent of about 16 times the unit’s 2018 adjusted earnings. But then again, as a mutual company privately owned by its policyholders, it probably has a lower cost of capital than its publicly-listed peers.For Cigna, the sale will allow it to focus on its core health insurance business. It will also benefit from the cash injection. The company is saddled with tens of billions of dollars of debt following its blockbuster $67bn takeover of pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts last year.The fact that Cigna is not planning to plough all the proceeds towards debt repayment should raise some eyebrows though. More than half of the expected $5.3bn in net proceeds will be spent on share buybacks instead. Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly.

1;CI;Cigna Corp;2019-12-18T14:39:27Z;New York Life aims to diversify with $6.3bn Cigna deal;Companies confirm takeover that will expand buyer’s non-medical insurance offerings;New York Life Insurance said on Wednesday it had clinched a $6.3bn deal to acquire a Cigna unit that sells employers non-medical insurance products, broadening the company’s offerings beyond the core life insurance and annuities businesses for which it is known.The Cigna group life and disability insurance business provides companies, non-profit organisations and other groups with accident, disability and life insurance plans that they can offer to their employees. The sale will provide a significant cash injection to Cigna, which was laden with debt after its $67bn takeover of pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts last year. The deal was expected to be completed in 2020, the two companies said. Cigna added that it would use the proceeds from the all-cash transaction to pay down debts and buy back shares.The takeover, which the Financial Times first reported had been agreed earlier this week, is the latest move by New York Life chief executive Ted Mathas to further diversify the insurance company. Mr Mathas has presided over a string of acquisitions since he took over as chief in 2008. In 2013, the company purchased Dexia’s asset management arm for more than $500m to bolster its investment unit, and over the past several years it has bought small stakes in a number of financial technology companies.“This transaction increases the value we can deliver to our policy owners, strengthens our well-defined business model, and adds millions of customers to the New York Life family,” said Mr Mathas.New York Life, founded in 1845, is one of the largest insurers in the US. It is a mutual company owned by its policyholders and does not trade publicly. The group is known for its life insurance policies and thousands of insurance agents. It claims to be the largest seller of direct-to-consumer life insurance plans through its partnership with AARP, a US non-profit organisation that advocates for older people.The purchase of the Cigna unit, which attracted several other interested buyers including MetLife and SunLife Financial, will catapult New York Life into one of the largest providers of non-medical insurance for group benefit programmes.It also could help expand New York Life’s offerings at a time when the biggest companies in the industry are trying to cope with sliding interest rates and fend off stiff competition from venture-backed start-ups pushing into more traditional insurance offerings.Analysts at Citigroup said last week that a sale of the unit would give Cigna the “financial flexibility” to pay down some of its roughly $39bn of debt and could save the health insurer more than $200m a year in interest expenses.The unit being sold to New York Life is part of one of Cigna’s smaller business lines, which generated $5.1bn of adjusted revenue last year — just over 10 per cent of the company’s $49bn of sales in 2018.Cigna shares were unchanged in pre-market trading on Wednesday, valuing the health insurer at $72bn.New York Life was advised by Credit Suisse, while Cigna received financial advice from Bank of America.

3;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;New York Life in talks to buy Cigna unit for nearly $6bn;Insurer emerges as frontrunner over MetLife and Sun Life Financial;New York Life Insurance is in advanced talks to acquire a Cigna unit that sells nonmedical insurance coverage to employers for nearly $6bn, according to multiple people briefed on the negotiations.The deal would bolster New York Life as it seeks to broaden its business beyond its core life insurance and annuities franchises, units that have come under pressure from a slide in interest rates and intense competition from rivals.New York Life had emerged as the frontrunner over MetLife and Sun Life Financial in the auction for the Cigna unit, which sells accident, disability and life insurance plans to companies to offer to their employees, the people said.New York Life and Cigna could ink a deal as early as this month, the people added. However, they cautioned that no agreement had yet been signed and another bidder could emerge with the Cigna unit if negotiations with New York Life break down.Cigna, MetLife, New York Life and Sun Life declined to comment.A sale of the unit would provide Cigna with a significant cash infusion after its blockbuster $67bn takeover of pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts last year. That deal saddled Cigna, which has a market value of about $72bn, with tens of billions of dollars of debt and prompted credit rating agency S&P Global to downgrade its opinion of the health insurance group.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the sale of the unit.
4;CI;Cigna Corp;2019-04-09T17:34:02Z;Pharmacy benefit managers face bipartisan criticism;Republican and Democratic senators accuse industry intermediaries of harming consumers;Republican and Democratic senators joined together at a hearing on Tuesday to accuse pharmacy benefit managers of harming consumers as both parties prepare to make soaring drug prices a key issue for the 2020 US elections.Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate Finance committee, said healthcare industry mergers are “increasingly prompting concerns” and questioned whether they help patients or could open the door to “anti-competitive activity”.Pharmacy benefit managers, known as PBMs, bridge the gap between drugmakers and insurers, deciding which drugs will be covered by insurance plans and negotiating rebates and discounts.But the three biggest players are now part of broader healthcare conglomerates. Last year, health insurer Cigna bought PBM ExpressScripts for $54bn, pharmacy chain and benefits manager CVS Health bought insurer Aetna for $69bn, and United Healthcare, which already owned PBM OptumRX, added smaller pharmacy chains.PBM profits are based on making a slice of the prescription drug pie more expensiveThe Federal Trade Commission is already looking into competition in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The three leading companies count 71 per cent of Medicare patients enrolled in prescription drug plans as their customers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research institution.Rising drug prices have become a key issue in the run-up to the 2020 polls, with both President Donald Trump and leading Democratic candidates trying to appeal to voters who feel they face higher out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions.Many senators spoke of meeting constituents who were skipping doses to try to control their drug bills. The price of insulin has come under particular scrutiny after some diabetics died from not receiving the vital hormone.Senator Ron Wyden, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat, accused PBMs of being more secretive about pricing than HBO is at guarding the end of Game of Thrones — calling them as “clear a middleman rip-off as you are going to find”.“PBMs actually make more money when they pick a higher priced drug over a lower priced drug,” he said. “PBM profits are based on making a slice of the prescription drug pie more expensive.”Five executives from the PBMs testified on Tuesday, insisting they operate in a very competitive market with over 60 players. Steve Miller, chief clinical officer of Cigna, said it was “wildly competitive” with many regional or local rivals, and that the consolidation of the industry helps them take better care of patients.The PBMs insisted that they passed all rebates on to consumers. But they pushed back on full public transparency, saying it would hamper their ability to negotiate effectively with drugmakers.When drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Merck appeared in front of the Senate in February, many blamed a complex system where pharmacy benefit managers do not pass rebates on to the patients.Alex Azar, health and human services secretary, has put forward a proposal to ban the complex system of rebates in the two major government-backed health plans — Medicare, for seniors, and Medicaid, for the poor — because of fears they are not passed on to the patients.But on Tuesday, pharmacy benefit managers pointed the finger at drugmakers, criticising them for deliberately delaying when lower-priced generics can come on to the market. John Prince, chief executive at Optum RX, said manufacturers continue to raise list prices because of a “lack of meaningful competition”.The executives also cited the rising cost of speciality drugs, only used by 2 per cent of patients, but which they said were set to account for about half of all drug costs by 2022. They pushed for drugmakers to consider more “value-based pricing”, where a drugs costs are dependent on successful treatment.Shares in Cigna rose 1.4 per cent to $169.83 in midday trading in New York, while United Healthcare ticked up 0.3 per cent to $249.56. CVS was flat at $54.10, while Humana was flat at $273.42.
5;CI;Cigna Corp;2019-02-01T17:25:37Z;Cigna says doesn’t expect meaningful impact from rebate rule;Insurer issues disappointing earnings outlook, shares slip;US health insurer Cigna was bruised on Friday as investors assessed the implications of a proposed rebate rule change on a recently acquired business, even as the company said it does not expect a “meaningful impact” and delivered a disappointing earnings outlook.The US Department of Health and Human Services late on Thursday proposed a rule to lower the cost of prescription drugs and out of pocket costs for patients by ending discounts to pharmacy benefit managers. PBMs work as middlemen between insurers and employers that foot the bill for medicines and manage Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug plans.“The proposed rebate rule will not have a meaningful impact on our growth or earnings trajectory,” said Cigna chief executive David Cordani on the company’s earnings call. He added that it does not apply to the commercial marketplace.Cigna shares fell as much as 5.6 per cent before recouping some of those losses to trade 2.5 per cent lower.HHS said under its plan drug rebates, which amount to between 26 and 30 per cent of a drug’s list price, could be directly handed over to patients at the counter. Pharmaceuticals have routinely complained they are pressured to provide rebates or risk bring frozen out by the handful of PBMs that dominate the market. They have also argued that PBMs do not pass discounts on to patients.Lowering healthcare costs was a key pledge of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign but many wonder about its implications for companies like Express Scripts, which Cigna bought for $67bn, and others like Humana.Also weighing on Cigna on Friday was its disappointing guidance. It forecast full-year adjusted earnings of between $16 to $16.50 a share, missing analysts’ estimates for $16.74, according to survey of analysts by Refinitiv.The Connecticut-based insurer reported adjusted revenues of $13.8bn in the three months ended in December, up 29 per cent from a year ago and ahead of analysts’ estimates of $11.6bn, according to a Refinitiv survey.Cigna’s net income fell to $144m, or 55 cents a share, down from $266m, or $1.07 a share, in the year-ago quarter. The company recorded special item charges of $389m in merger-related transaction costs. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $2.46 a share topped analysts’ estimates.
6;CI;Cigna Corp;2018-09-17T19:15:45Z;DoJ clears Cigna’s $67bn acquisition of Express Scripts;;The US Department of Justice has cleared Cigna’s $67bn takeover of Express Scripts, the companies announced on Monday, sending shares of major insurers higher.The approval clears a key obstacle to the deal, which still requires approval from regulators in 13 states before it can be completed. “We are another step closer to completing our merger,” said David Cordani, chief executive of Cigna, in a statement.Cigna, a health insurer, announced the takeover of Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager, in March. Activist investor Carl Icahn criticised the deal last month but quickly dropped his opposition to the merger. Shareholders approved the transaction in August.Shares in Express Scripts jumped 4.2 per cent on the news while those for Cigna were 1.9 per cent higher.CVS Health and Aetna, which are also awaiting regulatory approval for their own $69bn tie-up, also got a boost to their shares. CVS is up 1.5 per cent while Aetna gained 1 per cent.A justice department spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.
7;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;M&A/activists: Carl cools it;Companies can fight off activists with good arguments;Nothing is guaranteed to terrify a chief executive more than Carl Icahn tweeting about his or her company. It does not have to be that way. Last week Mr Icahn expressed his opposition to Cigna's pending $67bn acquisition of Express Scripts. Cigna, a huge health insurer, was seeking to integrate its supply chain by acquiring Express. This manages prescription benefits for companies and insurers. On Tuesday Mr Icahn said he would back off. His opposition to the deal had been quickly and substantively challenged by another large Cigna investor. Big proxy advisers also registered support for the transaction.M&A are at all-time highs. But so is investor agitation around them. This is a positive development. It forces management teams to rigorously defend their capital allocation choices.Mr Icahn had argued that the business model of Express Scripts was effectively broken. He had sold its shares short and owned less than 1 per cent of Cigna. Glenview Capital, a well-regarded hedge fund focused on healthcare, had a $1.3bn stake across the pair and had been a Cigna shareholder for a decade. It published a detailed 13-page letter explaining why the deal was perfectly sensible, both strategically and financially.Smart investors can have differing views. The debate between Mr Icahn and Glenview was appropriately meaty. The transaction looks likely to be approved by shareholders, leaving regulators to weigh in if they need to. Contrast that with the outcome in the merger of retailers, Albertsons and Rite Aid. That transaction collapsed before a shareholder vote. The companies could not convince their investors that the stock swap made sense on the announced terms. Share registers are dominated by passive index funds. Thankfully, activists such as Mr Icahn sometimes weigh in ensuring there is a debate. While it benefits all investors to test the rationale of deals, activists are not always right. Management and supportive shareholders can fight back and can win. 
8;CI;Cigna Corp;2018-08-14T10:57:29Z;Carl Icahn backs down over opposition to Cigna-Express Scripts deal;;Activist investor Carl Icahn has abruptly dropped his opposition to Cigna’s $67bn acquisition of Express Scripts, only a week after launching a withering attack that branded the deal “inexplicably ridiculous”.Mr Icahn’s climbdown ahead of a shareholder vote on August 24 follows expressions of support for the deal from the influential proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis, as well as backing for the takeover from Larry Robbins’s Glenview Capital Management hedge fund.Previously short Express Scripts stock, Mr Icahn said last week that “the only shareholders we believe would vote for this very risky acquisition are those who also own Express Scripts and are desperate to save it even at the expense of losing a great deal of value in their Cigna investment”.Writing two days later, Glenview — which said it had been invested in Cigna for a decade — said the price was “cheap”, the financial rewards “compelling” and that management had a “strong track record worthy of respect for their views”.On Monday Mr Icahn backed down, writing in a new letter that “in light of the ISS and Glass Lewis recommendations in favour of the Cigna/Express Scripts transaction and the significant stockholder overlap between the two companies, we have informed the SEC that we no longer intend to solicit proxies to vote against the transaction.”
9;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
10;CI;Cigna Corp;2018-08-09T18:50:45Z;Glenview backs Cigna-Express Scripts deal after Icahn blast;;"Larry Robbins’s Glenview Capital Management hedge fund has come out in support of Cigna’s proposed acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts for more than $60bn, two days after Carl Icahn railed against the deal.Glenview, which said it has been invested in Cigna for a decade, told the US health insurer’s shareholders in a letter the agreed price is “cheap” for what it is getting. The hedge fund owns around $1.3bn across Cigna and Express Scripts, split roughly evenly between the two.“Sensationalist headlines and intentionally misleading assertions from those with conflicting interests and limited analysis should not carry more weight than balanced diligence,” Glenview wrote in the letter.Mr Icahn, who is short Express Scripts stock, slammed the deal on Tuesday, calling it “inexplicably ridiculous” and a “folly” in an open letter to Cigna shareholders. He argued the company was “dramatically overpaying for a highly challenged business” that was “facing existential risks on several fronts.”Glenview wrote:“Based upon our own analysis, which we further describe herein, we conclude the following:a) Management and the Board have a strong track record worthy of respect for their views;b) The proposed transaction is well valued, well financed and contains adequate margins of safety;c) The strategic merit of vertical integration between managed care and pharmaceutical benefitmanagement has been proven and widely adopted by others in the industry;d) The financial rewards of the transaction are compelling; ande) The opportunity to lower healthcare costs for current and future consumers is exceedingly large, strengthening Cigna’s ability to grow and serve its clients for many years to come.”Shareholders are set to vote on the takeover on August 24."
11;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Cigna/Carl Icahn: rewriting the script;Veteran activist’s unhappiness comes from his experience as a customer;Carl Icahn is not a customer to alienate. On Tuesday, the veteran activist confirmed that he will vote against Cigna’s $67bn acquisition of Express Scripts.Cigna is the massive US health insurer whose acquisition of rival Anthem was nixed by regulators in 2017.Express Scripts, its latest target, is similarly large. But Express Scripts is in a different business: managing prescription plans for insurers or large employers.Mr Icahn says nine of his portfolio companies use Express Scripts services to manage employee drug plans at costs high enough to provoke his ire.In a letter, he warned that new entrants — Amazon— and new regulations in pharma supply could disrupt prescription benefit managers (PMBs) like Express Scripts.Cigna is paying a premium price to double down on this besieged and inefficient industry. Mr Icahn’s intervention is justified.PBMs argue that their heft in negotiating with drugmakers keeps down consumer prices.Their critics point to a “rebate” system where they capture a large chunk of escalating drug prices. A jump in Express Scripts shares from $10 to $90 in the decade to 2015 backs up that criticism.Mr Icahn suggests that Cigna could simply forge a commercial relationship with Express without buying it outright.That would discount the value — if there is any — in the financial engineering embodied in the deal. With its highly valued stock and inexpensive debt, Cigna can produce short-term earnings and cash flow accretion immune from longer-term strategic challenges.In M&A, activism usually occurs when a target company’s investors demand a price bump. This is a rare example of an investor opining on the judgment of acquirer.The wider implication for investors is that consolidation may only delay rather than prevent disruption of US healthcare businesses.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

12;CI;Cigna Corp;2018-08-07T10:45:11Z;Carl Icahn attacks ‘ridiculous’ Cigna takeover of Express Scripts;Activist investor attempts to derail $60bn health insurance deal;Carl Icahn has described as “inexplicably ridiculous” a more than $60bn deal by the US health insurer Cigna to buy Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager, in an attempt to derail the tie-up ahead of a shareholder vote later this month.The activist investor called the takeover a “folly” in an open letter to Cigna shareholders, arguing that the company was “dramatically overpaying for a highly challenged business” that was “facing existential risks on several fronts”.The healthcare sector has been a focus for dealmaking activity over the past year, as providers have sought scale to help hold down the cost of drugs and medical procedures, and fend off the threat from Amazon, which has the industry in its sights. Cigna’s tie-up with Express Scripts was announced before Jeff Bezos’s retail giant’s latest foray into the sector, however. Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack, an online pharmacy group that delivers repeat prescriptions to patients with high medication demands, was announced in June and marked a clear step-change in the ecommerce group’s expansion into the sector. Mr Icahn wrote in his letter: When Cigna entered into this agreement several months ago I believed a $60 billion purchase price made no sense, but there were at least arguments that could be made by management to try to persuade us into thinking that it was not completely ridiculous. These arguments now disappear in light of certain material events of the last month, such as Amazon’s almost certain entrance as a competitor to Express Scripts and the government’s direct challenge to the highly flawed rebate system. As a result, Express Scripts’ earnings will almost certainly be seriously diminished, but even more importantly, Express Scripts will be existentially challenged, ie, their very existence might well come into question over the next few years. Even if they do survive, exposing Cigna, a thriving company, to these risks by acquiring Express Scripts now is inexplicably ridiculous.While pharmacy benefit managers are little known outside of the US healthcare system, they pay a critical role in that market, acting as a middleman between drugmakers and the employers and insurance companies that buy their products. They rely on accumulating large numbers of patients across different “payers” and using that scale to secure discounts based on volume. The model is threatened by the possibility that the Trump administration will do away with drug rebates, which are negotiated between pharmacy benefit managers and drugmakers.Mr Icahn said the recent moves by the White House to rein in high prescription drug costs had “raised the risk level and, by definition, further impaired the value of Express Scripts since the deal was announced”. He noted that rebate customers were among the highest margin clients for pharmacy benefit managers.Express Scripts said it remained “confident in the deal” and that the group was positioned well to grow, citing what he characterised as “solid” second-quarter earnings. He added that pharmaceutical groups could simply cut drug pricing, instead of relying on rebates. Cigna could not immediately be reached for comment.Healthcare providers have also been anxiously awaiting word from Amazon and its joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway. The three companies have clubbed together to try to lower the cost of healthcare plans for their employees without the middleman.Shares of Express Scripts fell 2 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday to $75.25. Cigna stock was little changed.The deal between the two companies was announced earlier this year in the latest round of consolidation in the healthcare industry. Drugstore operator CVS Health late last year struck a deal to buy insurer Aetna for $69bn, while other groups have held talks about potential tie ups. Cigna had agreed to pay Express Scripts shareholders $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of its stock for every share investors held, worth roughly $94.48 a share on Tuesday. Mr Icahn, who disclosed on Tuesday that he was short Express Scripts stock, has little time to scuttle a deal. Shareholders are set to vote on the takeover on August 24.
13;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;A frenzy of dealmaking in pharma points to cost pressure;Takeda’s offer to pay $65bn for Shire comes amid a rush of M&A deals in healthcare;"Overnight, drugmaker Takeda struck a deal to buy Dublin-based Shire for $65bn. The tentative agreement, which came after repeated efforts by the Japanese group to tempt its rival into talks, is in line to be the 13th largest acquisition of all time.Takeda’s frantic efforts to snag Shire stem from a specific need to expand beyond its shrinking home market. But the multiple bids come amid a full blown mergers and acquisitions frenzy in pharmaceuticals and healthcare more broadly.More than $183bn in pharma deals have been announced since the start of the year, an all-time record for the year to date and more than in all of last year or in 2016, according to Dealogic. The $275bn in healthcare M&A is also a year-to-date record.The rush of dealmaking comes in two main flavours, both driven by pressure to cut healthcare costs. Not only are pharma companies worldwide rushing to buy one another, but a wave of consolidation has hit the complex web of for-profit companies that deliver US healthcare.The latter trend is exemplified by this year’s second largest transaction, insurer Cigna’s March agreement, now valued at $70bn including debt, to buy Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager. The deal comes on the heels of the December acquisition of health insurer Aetna by pharmacy chain CVS for $69bn. Another insurer, Humana, saw its shares jump earlier this month on reports that it was in conversations with retailer Walmart, which includes pharmacies in many of its stores.Fundamentally, these deals are a response to complaints about rising healthcare costs from US employers, who foot most of the bill by providing insurance to their employees. The growing unhappiness was highlighted by the announcement in January that Amazon, JPMorgan and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway were teaming up to form a not-for-profit aimed at cutting healthcare bills.The dealmakers are seeking to merge some of the layers built into the US system. They hope this will allow them to squeeze out costs, grab market share and improve their negotiating position versus the other players, such as hospital groups, drugmakers and doctors.“Employers are saying to their providers, you are not controlling my healthcare costs,” says Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. “The more you take control of the care process, the more likely you are to achieve your cost target.”The pharma deals also have an element of cost-cutting. By buying rivals with similar specialities, drugmakers can save money through combining marketing staffs. Some groups are also seeking to escape downward pricing pressure by buying unique treatments that do not have cheaper alternatives.In theory, this could be good for employers and those consumers who have to pay their own healthcare bills. US drug costs are rising much more slowly: gross spending on drugs rose 1.4 per cent last year, below inflation and a fraction of the 4.8 per cent rise in 2016. If that shift could be replicated in other parts of the sector, it would go a long way toward addressing runaway healthcare costs.But there are reasons to be cautious. It is much easier to slash drug prices than change hospital practices, and the big consolidation deals — Cigna-Express Scripts and CVS-Aetna — could yet be blocked by US antitrust authorities.Furthermore, the last big pharma acquisition spree — in 2015 and 2016 — has not paid off as hoped. Last month, AbbVie’s shares fell after it said it would not seek early approval for a lung cancer drug after paying $5.8bn for its maker in 2016. Meanwhile Alexion’s 2015 $8.4bn purchase of Synageva has failed to hit sales targets.Finally, even if the deals go through and the cost-cutting works, there is no guarantee that the general public will benefit. These are, after all, for-profit companies; their investors are likely to come first.brooke.masters@ft.com"
14;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Record ‘megadeals’ push global takeovers beyond $1.2tn;More than half of acquisitions in the first quarter were worth in excess of $5bn;More than $50bn worth of takeovers were being lined up on Wednesday, in a final flurry of dealmaking that saw global volumes exceed $1.2tn in a record-breaking quarter.In the latest sign of how eager boardrooms are sparking a record number of “megadeals”, Japan’s top drugmaker Takeda revealed it was weighing a $40bn takeover of Irish rival Shire.Concho Resources, a US oil and gas producer, agreed to buy rival RSP Permian for $9.5bn including debt and CME Group, the Chicago exchange, agreed to buy Nex Group, in a deal that valued the UK group at nearly £3.9bn.Despite a heightened level of political uncertainty, a potential US-led trade war against China and fraught Brexit negotiations, companies have embarked on an unprecedented number of big acquisitions this year. The value of $5bn-plus deals is more than triple year-ago levels, according to data provider Thomson Reuters.More than half of the $1.2tn worth of acquisitions in the first quarter — the fastest start to a year ever — have been worth in excess of $5bn.The overall level of activity is up more than 67 per cent from a year earlier and about a third ahead of 2007, the previous high-water mark for takeovers.The surge of big transactions — with more than 20 deals worth at least $10bn — has been bolstered by a desire by boards to head off disruptive technological threats and accelerate growth, according to bankers and lawyers who spoke to the Financial Times.The deals have been spurred by quickening global growth and robust business confidence, as well as tax cuts passed in the US last year that have added to the firepower for marquee acquisitions.“In an environment where growth is back, companies feel the pressure to justify the multiples they are trading on,” said Alison Harding-Jones, Citigroup’s Europe, Middle East and Africa M&A head.Dealmaking in Europe has more than doubled from year-ago levels, led by accelerating activity in the UK, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. Some bankers and lawyers expect the pace of divestitures to accelerate, opening the door for private equity groups.That was apparent in a €10.1bn deal, including debt, clinched this week between Carlyle and Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel for the latter’s speciality chemicals business. The acquisition is one of the largest European private equity deals agreed in recent years.Stephen Arcano, head of M&A at Skadden, said companies were being vigilant about potential political risks but for the time being there was no evidence that the pace of deal talks would slow down later in the year.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi and James Fontanella-KhanHere are some of the significant themes that have emerged in the first quarter of dealmaking in 2018.Morgan Stanley dethroned its rival Goldman Sachs from the top of the world’s M&A rankings in the first quarter of 2018, due to a consistent pipeline of megadeals in the first three months of the year, writes James Fontanella-Khan.Morgan Stanley advised buyers and sellers around the globe for a total of $385bn worth of deals, about a third more than the $264bn worth of transactions Goldman advised on during the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.The advisory division led by Robert Kindler, Morgan Stanley’s vice-chairman and global head of M&A, worked on fewer deals than Goldman during the same period — 65 compared with 85 — but on significantly more big-ticket transactions.Morgan Stanley advised on six out of the 10 largest deals, including US health insurer Cigna’s $68.5bn acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts and European media group Sky, which was approached by US cable company Comcast in a deal worth $39.8bn.Although the data for Morgan Stanley were slightly skewed by the inclusion of Unilever choosing Rotterdam over London for its single legal base — which Thomson Reuters valued as a $90.5bn transaction — the New York investment bank would have still ended the quarter at the top.JPMorgan Chase and Citibank followed the two investment banks in third and fourth position in the rankings, respectively.Centerview Partners, which jumped from 21st to fifth in the ranking, was the only boutique investment bank to make it into the top 10.The firm co-founded by Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan advised Express Scripts in its sale to Cigna and Thomson Reuters in the $17bn sale of the majority of its financial and risk assets to Blackstone.Bankers and lawyers are blaming regulatory uncertainty and jittery relations between the US and China for a 15 per cent decline in Chinese cross-border dealmaking so far this year, writes Don Weinland.Chinese companies spent just $25.2bn on overseas assets in the first quarter, while the number of deals fell to the lowest mark since 2005, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The only sizeable negotiation so far in 2018 was Geely’s unsolicited $9bn investment in Germany’s Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz.Behind the low deal count is a deterioration of relations between China and the US and more resistance against China’s acquisitions of US technology.“For me the biggest challenge is the regulatory uncertainty in the US and the future of US-China relations,” said Miranda So, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Davis Polk. “It’s this risk that has subdued some of the appetite for overseas deals.”In a report for new tariffs on Chinese exports last week, the US named several companies that have repeatedly bought US businesses and technologies. The accusation from the US administration is that Chinese policy and cheap loans from state banks were behind the flurry of deals over the past three years.But M&A activity is expected to pick up in coming months as China’s political situation firms up, although the focus could fall outside of the US.“The government’s new economic team is in place in Beijing and everything has settled down,” said Tang Zhenyi, chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank CLSA. “Now the corporations can focus on going out, on going global. I think that means it will be a big year for Chinese companies doing overseas deals.”A series of sensitive political meetings kicking off in October of last year had disrupted deal flows in 2017, with companies such as HNA Group waiting for clarity on what types of outbound investment would be allowed.The crackdown was swift, just as much as it was unexpected. In short order earlier this month, the US government acted to, in effect, block the prospects of the largest technology acquisition of all time: the $142bn takeover of chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom, writes Arash Massoudi.The use of national security concerns by President Donald Trump to block a takeover that had yet to be agreed was unprecedented and spooked dealmakers around the world at a time when the US government is pursuing more protectionist policies.It is uncertain whether a further freeze in global dealmaking will take a hold, but for now cross-border mergers and acquisitions account for more than $511.7bn in overall activity in the first quarter of this year. That is up 76 per cent from the same period a year ago and advisers see no sign that a slowdown is coming.“M&A dialogue remains robust despite concerns about the potential impact of changes in America’s trade and national security policies on deal activity,” said Stephen Arcano, head of M&A at Skadden.One area where the US actions did have an effect however was in deals from China, with companies from the country registering just 4 per cent of the activity so far in 2018.US companies launched more than $101bn worth of overseas deals, with the largest move coming from cable group Comcast as it tries to break up a takeover of UK pay-TV broadcaster Sky.Other significant cross-border transactions in the period include Italy’s Atlantia and Spain’s ACS teaming up to jointly take over Abertis, the Spanish highway concessions group.The largest European deal into the US came in January when privately held consumer group JAB Holding agreed to pay $18.7bn in cash to acquire soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple and combine it with its Keurig Green Mountain coffee business.Global private equity deals have enjoyed their strongest start in five years, buoyed by the record amounts of cash flowing into the sector as institutional investors look for ways to boost their returns, writes Javier Espinoza.Buyout-backed transactions totalled $79.7bn in the first quarter, a 30 per cent rise from a year earlier. The figure represents 7 per cent of overall global dealmaking activity, according to Thomson Reuters data.The US saw the biggest increase in private equity transactions with a 52 per cent rise in deals led by buyout funds, accounting for a total of $46.4bn so far this year. In Europe dealmaking jumped 27 per cent, totalling $19bn and the most active year since 2007. Asian deal flow shrank slightly.The two largest transactions for the first quarter were Blackstone’s $17bn acquisition of the financial terminals and data unit of Thomson Reuters and Carlyle’s €10.1bn acquisition of Akzo Nobel’s speciality chemicals unit.Rob Pulford, head of financial sponsors for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs, said he expects activity levels to surpass those of 2017. He said: “This year is as good as last year and I think 2018 will be even more active. We are seeing the biggest deals in a long time.”Mr Pulford expects a bulk of the deals to come from private equity groups acquiring listed companies following a doubling in the value of such deals last year. “The level of dialogue and conversation around public to private transactions has accelerated from last year. Boards of companies have decided that what’s on offer is compelling,” he said.But as the pace of dealmaking speeds up, advisers to buyout funds have warned that there is a risk of overpaying for assets as multiples have already surpassed the record highs of before the financial crisis.* This article has been amended since original publication to correct the denomination of the Nex Group acquisition from dollars to pounds
15;CI;Cigna Corp;2018-03-08T19:38:09Z;Cigna grabs vital scale with $67bn deal for Express Scripts;Takeover of pharmacy benefits manager to provide clout when buying drugs and services;With its $67bn takeover of Express Scripts, health insurer Cigna is sending a signal that it will have to get bigger to deal with the most pressing malady of US healthcare: soaring costs.Express Scripts was the last large independent pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM, which acts a middleman in negotiations between drugmakers and the payers — the employers, insurers, and government, which buy medicines in the US. By buying the PBM, Cigna hopes to gain more scale so it can drive a harder bargain when buying drugs and services, not just from pharmaceutical companies, but also the doctors and hospitals that provide patient care. Since employers started funding healthcare during the second world war, the US system has fragmented into hundreds of for-profit companies, from insurers and private hospitals to blood-testing labs, pharmacies and drugmakers. Although all these companies insist they put patients first, they also have a competing duty to provide shareholder returns, and all have benefited in different ways as US healthcare expenditure, adjusted for inflation, jumped from $221bn in 1960 to $3.4tn in 2016, growing on average 5 per cent annually over that period.“The healthcare ecosystem puts tremendous pressure on our society, and by expansion on far too many individuals and families,” said David Cordani, chief executive of Cigna, on an investor call on Thursday, adding that the deal would make it “more affordable” for its customers to access care. With total US health spending forecast to hit $5.7tn by 2026, large employers from Walmart to IBM have started to worry that spiralling costs will eat into their profits and are demanding change. “The impetus behind this is that major corporates are really angry that insurance vendors like Cigna have been unable to contain the increase in costs,” says Roger Longman, chief executive of Real Endpoints, a health analytics company. “One of Cigna’s points is that they’ll have a lot more buying power after this deal,” he adds. That anger has prompted the formation of various alliances between large companies. Most recently Amazon announced it would start a new venture with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway with a mission to lower costs. And 40 large employers including American Express, Verizon and Coca-Cola have joined the Health Transformation Alliance, which is tasking the companies that provide healthcare to find ways to do more with less. So far, the response of companies such as Cigna and CVS Healthcare — the drugstore chain that recently agreed to buy health insurer Aetna for $69bn— has been to get bigger through megadeals, arguing that consolidation will give them the power they need to push down costs. Although the fragmented US healthcare system is still a far cry from the UK’s National Health Service, these deals are at least in part designed to emulate some of the huge power wielded by “single payer” healthcare systems. If a drugmaker wants to sell its medicines to patients in the UK, it must agree to sell those products at a price deemed acceptable by the country’s powerful gatekeeper, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or forgo those sales entirely. More often than not, pharmaceutical companies agree to sell their drugs at a considerably lower price in the UK, but insurers such as Cigna and Aetna can only dream of having such power. Drug costs, though, are only part of the problem: although spending on medicines has been rising well above inflation — especially for medicines prescribed by specialist doctors — drugs still only account for roughly 15 per cent of total healthcare costs. A far bigger chunk of the cash — about 60 per cent — goes to doctors and private hospitals, which earn more when spending is high. To tackle that part of healthcare spending, Mr Longman predicts that companies such as Cigna and UnitedHealthcare, the largest insurer, will start buying hospitals and clinics, and change their business models so they are incentivised to bring down costs. One of the driving forces behind the CVS and Aetna deal was a plan to turn CVS’s pharmacies into healthcare hubs, where Aetna’s patients could be directed to receive low-cost care. UnitedHealth has also moved into the “provider” sector, and in December spent $4.9bn on DaVita, which operates a network of clinics. It is still unclear, however, whether antitrust regulators in the US will agree that the megadeals being pursued by Cigna and CVS really are necessary to lower costs. Health insurers made much the same argument in 2015 when they tried to merge with each other in 2015 through big-ticket takeovers, but the Department of Justice blocked the deals.
16;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T06:59:50+0000;Cigna/Express Scripts: aggregator aggregated;US insurer’s decision to buy healthcare manager is an odd one;Cigna’s motto is “go deeper, go local, go beyond”. To which, one might add: “Just don’t go bust.” In fairness, the US insurer is strong enough to buy healthcare manager Express Scripts for $67bn including debt with little risk of that. However, the $3tn American healthcare market is undergoing a big shake-up. The unthinkable is readily contemplated. HIV medicine delivered by Amazon drone, for example.The inefficiency of the US healthcare system suggests the optimising hand of the market may be unseen only because it is absent. Political broadsides against high drug prices are just one token of public discontent. Costs will have to fall, with or without help from Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. This makes Cigna’s decision to buy Express Scripts an odd one.Vertical integration is less likely to irk trust busters than the horizontal kind. Savings of up to $600m a year should follow. But, as the biggest independent pharmacy benefits manager in the US, Express Scripts is intermediation writ large. For all their slick marketing, these businesses are just buying clubs. They pool demand for healthcare, squeeze bulk discounts from drugs and hospitals groups and keep a cut for themselves. Like Seth Rogen comedies, they are a US institution whose utility eludes other nations.Cigna’s strategic justifications for the deal are vague. Phrases such as “an expanded portfolio of health services” crop up. Some Express Scripts clients are insurers. They might resent dealing with a rival. Cigna’s promise to raise revenues by 6-8 per cent a year looks optimistic, given cost pressures.There is nothing penny pinching about the bid, even though Cigna shares would cover half the equity consideration. The premium to the undisturbed three-month price is around 26 per cent, according to S&P Global data. Savings, when taxed and capitalised, would cover less than half of that. Jefferies calculates an enterprise value of 12.7 times earnings before standard deductions, allowing for a big contract loss. That looks expensive, although debt assumed by Cigna should be manageable.A 10 per cent drop in Cigna’s shares showed it has persuading to do. CVS’s $77bn purchase of Aetna is even pricier. But the logic of combining pharmacies with insurance is more persuasive. When supply chains contract, middle men get squeezed out.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

17;CI;Cigna Corp;2018-03-08T12:26:32Z;Cigna unveils $67bn deal to buy Express Scripts;Purchase comes as one-time rivals buy each other to better cope with spiralling costs;Cigna, the health insurer, added to the deals frenzy gripping the US healthcare industry by announcing plans to acquire Express Scripts, a large pharmacy benefits manager, for $67bn including debt. Mergers and acquisitions activity in the healthcare sector is running at a record pace this year, with $127bn of deals agreed so far, according to Dealogic, the data provider. The fevered activity has helped push overall dealmaking to its fastest pace since the dotcom boom in 2000. In December, pharmacy group CVS agreed the $69bn takeover of health insurer Aetna, while Walgreens Boots Alliance, the drugstore group, has held talks with AmerisourceBergen, a leading distributor of medicines. Analysts and investors say the rapid consolidation is a response to the threat posed by Amazon entering the healthcare industry in an attempt to lower the soaring cost of drugs and medical procedures in the US. US healthcare spending is forecast to hit $5.7tn in 2026, up from $3.4tn in 2016, and companies such as Amazon — which fund healthcare plans for their employees — are worried the exploding costs will eat into profits.The Cigna deal comes weeks after Amazon said it was forming a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway with the task of lowering costs for the trio’s almost 1m employees and “potentially all Americans”.The transaction would combine the fifth-largest health insurer with a pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM, which acts as a middleman handling negotiations between drugmakers and the insurance companies and employers that buy medicines. PBMs are relatively unknown outside of the private market-based US healthcare system.David Cordani, Cigna chief executive, said the acquisition — the largest deal agreed so far this year — would create a company that was “well-positioned to drive greater quality and affordability for customers”.News of the deal sent Express Scripts shares rallying 10 per cent in early trading in New York. Cigna’s stock fell 10 per cent.The PBM business model involves amassing large numbers of patients from several “payers” and using that heft to demand rebates from drugmakers, who are often willing to offer large discounts to ensure their products are included on the list of medicines for which PBMs will pay. The largest PBMs — Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum — together negotiate on behalf of roughly 250m people or “covered lives”. Express Scripts was the last remaining large independent PBM after CVS bought Caremark in 2006. Optum is a unit of UnitedHealth, the country’s biggest health insurer.Express Scripts’ business model has come under attack from politicians and rival companies in recent months, amid claims it is incentivised to do deals with drugmakers that boost its own profits while pushing up costs for patients and clients — a charge it has vehemently denied. Cigna said it would pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 of its own shares for each Express Scripts share, giving the target company an equity value of roughly $54bn. The takeout value represents a premium of roughly 31 per cent over the target company’s undisturbed stock price. Cigna will also take on Express Scripts’ $13bn of net debt. Once the transaction is complete, Cigna shareholders will own about 64 per cent of the company while Express Scripts investors will hold the remaining 36 per cent.
18;CI;Cigna Corp;2018-03-04T20:00:10Z;How online MBAs are winning over employers by degrees;More companies recognise the quality of digital courses — but not everyone is convinced;Each year, Fiat Chrysler recruits 50 people globally into a leadership programme, most of whom have MBAs. The carmaker insists that it treats graduates of online and full-time MBAs the same when it assesses applications.“Online MBA students are equally as competitive as those attending classes on campus,” says Kathryn Lee, human resources director for North America at Fiat Chrysler.Employers’ attitudes vary, however. While some companies recognise the qualities demonstrated by studying online, such as independence and self-motivation, others prefer the familiarity of the traditional campus degree.Companies eager to find more experienced graduates often perceive advantages in recruiting from online courses. For example, the average online MBA participant at London’s Imperial College Business School is 35, with 11 years of work experience, whereas the average full-time student at the school is 29, with six years’ experience.An online MBA can also demonstrate that a candidate is adept at managing multiple priorities. “People who do online programmes usually have a wealth of experience, work full-time and balance the demands of their position with the MBA,” says Ms Lee at Fiat Chrysler. “They display qualities that are important in people we hire — a strong work ethic, project management and critical thinking skills.”However, she adds that reputation, brand and accreditation are more important for online MBAs because they are newer to the market. “A course without a strong reputation would be a concern because it indicates poor candidate quality. We look at benchmark data on the quality of online programmes — rankings.”People studying for MBAs online are not always seeking a new employer. Last year at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business in Pittsburgh, only 16 of the 33 online MBA students sought a job at a new company.Of those, 75 per cent had an offer within three months of graduation. Technology and finance were the largest recruiting sectors, followed by consulting. The average salary across the cohort was $116,800, a 38 per cent increase on pre-MBA pay of $84,500.Andrew Stevens is a 2016 graduate of the two-year, $60,000 Carey Online MBA at Arizona State University in the US. The 30-year-old stresses the importance of the career services team, which he says helped him secure a customer management job at McKesson, the healthcare supply chain company. “We had the same level of career support as campus students,” Mr Stevens says.“They helped me to align my story with the job, which was pivotal to getting it,” he adds. The MBA network helped, too — an alumnus at McKesson “got me in front of the right people”.“The degree is more prevalent now and employers are used to seeing folks who used online education in some form or another,” Mr Stevens says. “Employers never raised any concerns. They were more interested in the things I learnt from the programme, such as finance and accounting skills.”Some employers still have reservations, however — for example that students may miss out on group collaboration. Being able to work with a wide variety of people is among the top five skills sought by MBA recruiters, according to FT data. “The ability to interact with other participants and build communication skills is a concern,” says Lisa Umenyiora, director of Imperial’s careers service.Imperial has addressed the problem by becoming more sophisticated in the way it uses technology, she says. The Hub, Imperial’s virtual learning environment, enables remote group work at any time, regardless of location.Another concern for recruiters is that online MBAs are often smaller than campus courses, partly by design, as it is difficult to manage large online groups.Sandy Khan, founder of IN-CO, which runs events at which MBA students can meet business leaders, says that this smaller scale can be inefficient for employers looking to build a talent pipeline.“If you have a large number of jobs to fill, it makes more sense to go to a course with a large volume of candidates, which tend to be campus programmes.”Ms Khan, who was previously an MBA recruitment manager at Google, adds that some business schools still need to educate employers on the benefits of hiring online students. “Even in blue-chip, multinational brands, you would be surprised by how many recruiters do not even know what an online MBA is.”Some employers prefer to meet recruits in person on campus, which is a problem for online students who are not on often there.“We want to assess their fit with our culture,” says Daniel Robinson, medical economics manager at Cigna, the health insurer. “It is harder for an online student to demonstrate fit, even on a video, because they spend less time with us discovering our culture than those on campus do.”The Tepper school in the US has a novel solution: online students can “meet” recruiters on campus by remotely controlling the “TepperBot 3000” — a small Segway wheeled device with an iPad for a head, speakers and a microphone, that displays the student’s face, allowing real-time conversations.“Recruiters have told us it’s just as effective for interviews as the real thing,” says Stephen Rakas, executive director for careers.
19;CI;Cigna Corp;2018-02-01T17:02:08Z;Cigna shares fall on forecast of slower customer growth;;Shares in Cigna were down on Thursday after a drop in net income and predictions of slower customer growth took some of the shine off solid revenue growth last year.The health insurer reported net income halved to $266m in the fiscal fourth quarter from the three months ended September 30, and was down 30 per cent from a year earlier.Revenues grew 6 per cent to $10.5bn in the December quarter from a year earlier and 2 per cent better than the mean of analysts’ estimates surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Full-year revenue of $41.6bn was up 5 per cent from 2016.Cigna focuses on providing healthcare plans to large- and medium-sized corporates and sells international insurance. The company’s medical customer base was 15.9m at the end of 2017, a gain of more than 700,000 customers during the year, and was supported by growth in its commercial market segments.The total commercial medical care ratio — the proportion an insurer spends on medical claims versus income from premiums — was 84.3 per cent in the fourth quarter and 79.9 per cent in 2017, which Cigna said reflected “strong performance and effective medical cost management in our employer business, the impact of the health insurance tax moratorium, and expected seasonally higher fourth quarter medical cost.”However, it expects the commercial MCR to come in between 77.5 per cent and 78.5 per cent in 2018, meaning it should spend less of its premium on medical costs and related claimsCigna also forecast revenue growth of between 7 per cent and 8 per cent in 2018 but sees medical customer growth of between 300,000 and 500,000 this year. That would point to slower customer growth in both percentage and nominal terms from 2017.Shares were down 2.9 per cent in late morning trade in New York and are 0.4 per cent lower year-to-date.Like many health insurers, Cigna’s shares took a hit earlier this week when Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan announced they would form a non-profit company dedicated to lowering healthcare costs for their almost 1m employees.Asked about the trio’s announcement during Cigna’s earnings call on Thursday, chief executive David Cordani said “Employers will continue to push for more value . . . We think that creates more opportunity rather than less for us,” Forbes reported.JPMorgan is a health insurance customer of Cigna and United Health, according to analysts.
20;CI;Cigna Corp;2017-10-26T23:35:56Z;CVS Health holds deal talks with Aetna;Shares in health insurance group rise on takeover reports sending valuation to $60bn;CVS Health, one of the largest US pharmacy retailers, has held high-level talks about a combination with health insurer Aetna which would create one of the most powerful forces in the prescription drugs industry.The talks come at a time of potentially tectonic shifts in the pharmacy industry, which is abuzz with rumours that Amazon plans to enter the sector. Earlier on Thursday, it emerged the retail giant had received wholesale licenses from at least 12 US state pharmacy boards.However, CVS and Aetna have been exploring a number of deals throughout the industry in recent months and there is no certainty anything will come of the discussions, after premature revelations. CVS is working with bankers at Evercore Partners and Barclays, while Aetna is working with Lazard.A CVS-Aetna deal would combine the third largest health insurer in the US with the two planks of CVS’s business: a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) that negotiates the prices of medicines with pharma groups, and the country’s biggest drugstore chain with almost 10,000 stores.Investors sold off shares in PBMs, drugstore chains and pharmaceuticals wholesalers on the speculation of a possible deal and the Amazon move, with Express Scripts, Walgreens, RiteAid and McKesson shedding between 3 and 6 per cent. Shares in Aetna jumped by 12 per cent, giving the company a market capitalisation of almost $60bn, while CVS lost around 3 per cent, putting its stock market value at $74.5bn.Some other insurers also have an integrated model that combines an insurer with a PBM, such as UnitedHealth, which cuts deals with drugmakers through its OptumRx division, and a consortium of Blue Cross Blue Shield state health plans, which negotiate via Prime Therapeutics. Anthem, the second largest health insurer, also entered the PBM sector recently by launching a new operator called IngenioRx. But a CVS-Aetna deal would stand out if consummated because it combines a large drugstore chain with an insurer for the first time, and also because it would put the pharmacy group rather than the insurer in pole position. One analyst, who asked not to be named, said they viewed the talks as a direct response to fears that Amazon plans to enter the pharmaceuticals industry by selling drugs online, setting up a PBM, or doing both. Although the licenses Amazon has applied for do not necessarily mean the company plans to sell prescription drugs, the company has hired several executives and managers from the healthcare industry in recent months. CVS and Aetna declined to comment on what they described as rumours and speculation. The talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.It is far from clear that the CVS-Aetna combination would be approved by regulators: the Department of Justice recently torpedoed a tie-up between Cigna and Anthem as well as Aetna’s takeover of Humana, warning that both transactions would harm consumers by reducing competition.However, CVS and Aetna could present a deal as consumer-friendly because the combined company would potentially be able to extract better deals from drugmakers and help to contain the soaring price of medicines, according to one person briefed on the companies’ plans.President Donald Trump has described the prices charged for drugs by pharmaceutical groups as tantamount to “getting away with murder”.Drugmakers already say that PBMs, insurers and wholesalers are collaborating in ways that is hurting their margins, and generic drugmakers such as Teva and Mylan have blamed more powerful customers for price deflation that is roiling the industry.
21;CI;Cigna Corp;2017-07-23T11:37:31Z;US health insurers shrug off chaos over Obamacare;Share prices outpace the market as groups focus on other areas of their businesses;"Shares in US health insurers have outpaced the broader stock market rally, shrugging off the chaotic debate over the future of Obama’s signature healthcare law.The sector’s big five companies, including Aetna and Humana, have enjoyed share price rises of more than 30 per cent since the election, having stepped away from participation in unprofitable parts of the Obamacare system and thanks to improvements in other areas of their business.While the long-term fate of Obamacare’s individual insurance markets and expanded government-backed Medicaid programme hang in the balance on Capitol Hill, the insurers are being rewarded by investors for having stabilised their profit margins.“The hit from regulatory changes is behind them,” said Ana Gupte, a healthcare analyst at Leerink Partners. The decline in margins, which resulted from the Obamacare rules and regulations on coverage has “levelled off”, she said.Investors have focused, in part, on growth from a different government-backed programme, Medicare, which is largely unaffected by Republican lawmakers’ back-and-forth over whether and how to “repeal and replace” Obamacare. Insurers have been adding customers to their Medicare Advantage plans for senior citizens.Medicaid programmes that provide health insurance to low-income Americans have also proved lucrative, as insurers add members to the managed care programmes they operate under state contracts — although the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare would be thrown into reverse under the Republican reform plans floated so far.But the companies still face profound uncertainty over the way US healthcare will change under Donald Trump. The administration could take steps to further affect regulations on health coverage in the near term.Yet even as the latest Republican reform bill collapsed in the Senate last week, UnitedHealth Group, considered an industry bellwether, exceeded Wall Street’s expectations in its second-quarter earnings report. The company, which also operates a medical services arm known as Optum, recorded net income of $2.28bn, or $2.32 per share, up 30 per cent from the same three months in 2016. UnitedHealth Group revenues were up nearly 8 per cent at $50.1bn, even after it forewent business by withdrawing from several Obamacare insurance marketplaces.Since inception, the Obamacare insurance exchanges, which enabled some 20m Americans to purchase cover, often with government subsidies, have proved to be more of a headache than a boon for business. More sick people than expected and too few young, healthy individuals signed up for plans, skewing the balance of risk in insurance pools.However, an analysis of insurers’ first-quarter earnings by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests these marketplaces are becoming more profitable, as higher premiums and slower growth in the rate of patients’ medical claims lift pressure on the margins.As signs of near-term reform grew less likely this year, Aetna and Humana, whose proposed tie-up was blocked by a federal judge in January, opted out of the exchanges for 2018. Mark Bertolini, Aetna’s chief executive, told Yahoo Finance last week that there would need to be a “stable and predictable market” for the insurer to return in future years.The essential briefing for decision makers on global healthUnitedHealth filed 2018 plan rates in just two states after abandoning most of the exchanges in 2017. Connecticut-based Cigna filed to participate in six.Of the big five, Anthem is most exposed to the Obamacare exchanges; the insurer holds licences for the popular Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in several states. However, Joseph Swedish, Anthem chief executive, told analysts in April that the company might be forced to reduce its service area or exit some markets if subsidies are cut by the Trump administration. Insurers have until the end of September to commit to state exchanges for 2018.Those who filed to remain were projected to ask state regulators to approve premium increases of between 28 and 40 per cent, in part to account for uncertainty in Washington as well as rising healthcare costs, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman.Stephen Hemsley, UnitedHealth chief executive, told analysts last week that policy changes in Washington, including healthcare and tax reform, could have an effect on 2018 earnings. “Certainly at this stage in the national conversation, speculation about any outcome here would just be that,” he said."
22;CI;Cigna Corp;2017-05-11T22:07:23Z;US judge said to hand Cigna a win in fight to exit Anthem deal;;US health insurer Cigna said it has notched a win in its legal battle with rival and one-time prospective merger partner Anthem.A judge in Delaware on Thursday denied Anthem’s bid to enjoin Cigna from walking away from its proposed $48bn acquisition, Reuters reported, although implementation of the decision was stayed until Monday to give Anthem a chance to appeal.Cigna confirmed the decision in an emailed statement on Thursday, adding: “We look forward to closing this final chapter.”The two companies exchanged lawsuits in the wake of a separate ruling earlier this year that blocked Cigna’s proposed $48bn acquisition of Anthem, after US antitrust regulators ruled that its effect “may be substantially to lessen competition” in “what is already a highly concentrated market”.Shortly after that decision, Cigna sued Anthem to seek a reverse $1.85bn termination fee and additional damages “in an amount exceeding $13bn” including lost shareholder value, accusing Anthem of not using its “reasonable best efforts to secure regulatory approval for the transaction”.Anthem shot back that Cigna had no right to unilaterally pull the plug, even after the court decision blocking their tie-up. It has filed a petition asking the US Supreme Court to review that ruling.Anthem did not return a request for comment on Thursday. Both insurers’ shares were flat in after-hours trading.Cigna and Anthem aren’t the only mega-insurers to see their tie-up plans thwarted by courts this year. Humana and Aetna also had their proposed merger blocked by a federal judge, although their subsequent break-up has been far less litigious — Aetna said in February it would cough up a $1bn breakup fee for Humana.
23;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T06:59:50+0000;Cigna ends Anthem merger, sues for more than $14bn;;The fight will apparently go on. Health insurer Cigna said it will pull the plug on its planned merger with rival Anthem, following a judge’s decision that blocked the merger on antitrust grounds. At the same time, it launched a lawsuit against Anthem to seek a reverse $1.85bn termination fee and additional damages “in an amount exceeding $13bn.”To which Anthem has responded – not so fast.Cigna said in a statement that the damages it is seeking includes lost value to its shareholders as a result of Anthem’s alleged breach of their merger agreement – including lost deal premium, the missed upside opportunity from the hoped-for combined company and information about Cigna’s inner workings that Anthem gleaned through the deal process.Cigna further elaborated in a statement that Anthem was obligated under the terms of the merger agreement to “use its reasonable best efforts to secure regulatory approval for the transaction and its obligation to refrain from misappropriating Cigna’s confidential information”.It also accused Anthem of abandoning what it described as their an agreed-upon strategy to focus on the benefits that a combined company would bring to the health insurance marketplace – a strategy it hoped would win regulators’ blessing and assuage antitrust concerns. Instead, Cigna blamed Anthem for pursuing a “unilateral strategy” to bolster its Blue Cross Blue Shield network, which it said ultimately persuaded the judge that the deal would limit competition.“As a result, the path for regulatory approval of the transaction was fatally compromised and Cigna and its shareholders were harmed,” Cigna said in a regulatory filing.Anthem maintains that Cigna has no right to unilaterally pull the plug:“Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cigna does not have a right to terminate the agreement. Therefore, Cigna’s purported termination of the merger agreement is invalid. Anthem will continue to enforce its rights under the merger agreement and remains committed to closing the transaction.”Cigna said in a regulatory filing that it had reached out to Anthem in an attempt to resolve their differences over the merger agreement, but that they were unsuccessful in their efforts to reach a solution without litigation.Last week, a federal judge ruled in favour of the US Justice Department’s lawsuit to block Cigna’s $48bn acquisition of its rival insurer, which followed close on the heels of another judge’s determination that another proposed health insurer mega-merger between Aetna and Humana was also anti-competitive.Aetna said earlier on Tuesday that it would pay Humana a $1bn breakup fee after their proposed merger foundered in the wake of the court’s ruling.
24;CI;Cigna Corp;2017-02-09T04:28:12Z;US federal court blocks $48bn Anthem-Cigna merger;Judge says deal might substantially reduce competition in concentrated market ;Cigna’s $48bn acquisition of rival US health insurer Anthem has been blocked by a federal judge, marking the second time in as many weeks that US courts have knocked down a takeover in the industry on competition grounds.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington ruled late on Wednesday that the effect of the tie-up between Anthem and Cigna “may be substantially to lessen competition” in “what is already a highly concentrated market”, particularly in the sale of commercial health insurance to “national accounts” — customers with more than 5,000 employees, typically spread over two or more states.The decision, which will result in Anthem paying a $1.85bn break fee to Cigna, is set to further unravel the wave of consolidation that swept the health insurance sector in 2015 in the aftermath of then-President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare policy.Several large insurers believed there was a tacit agreement with the Obama administration that if they agreed to participate in the former government’s plan, which included providing health insurance to 20m people who had no coverage, they would have been allowed to merge with rivals to face higher costs.However, the Department of Justice filed two lawsuits last summer to block the Cigna-Anthem deal as well as Aetna’s $37bn takeover of Humana as it warned that both transactions would harm consumers’ interests by reducing competition.Aetna’s tie-up with Humana was also blocked last month by US District Judge John Bates, who ruled that the deal was anti-competitive.On Wednesday, Judge Jackson noted that the claimed medical cost savings, championed in particular by Anthem, were not “merger-specific, they are not verifiable, and it is questionable whether they are ‘efficiencies’ at all”.The merger first announced in 2015 between Anthem and Cigna — the second and third-largest medical insurers in the US — has been on shaky ground for months. A filing from the DoJ in September revealed the two companies had been trading accusations of breaching deal terms.All large insurers involved in the wave of dealmaking have since complained that due to so-called Obamacare they were incurring losses. They said this was because a large number of people who signed up to the new public marketplaces providing insurance were either much sicker or older than expected.Many insurers threatened to pull out completely from the Obamacare exchanges unless their deals were approved by the court.However, since Donald Trump was elected US president in November, the future of America’s healthcare has been in a state of uncertainty. The former New York property tycoon and reality TV showman signed an executive order within hours of becoming president that significantly reduced the enforcement of the Obama administration’s health act. It called on government agencies to waive or delay parts of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a “cost, penalty or burden” on individuals or insurers, as well as other businesses and states.Mr Trump said he plans to withdraw completely Obamacare but has not clarified what would replace it, leaving about 20m Americans in a state of limbo. The controversial decision, however, has raised the hopes of the health insurers who have seen their deals challenged, as some analysts expect that the new administration will be more open to consolidation.
25;CI;Cigna Corp;2017-02-09T01:46:15Z;US federal court blocks Anthem-Cigna merger on competition grounds;;The planned $48.4bn acquisition of Cigna by rival US health insurer Anthem has been blocked by a federal judge, marking the second time in as many weeks US courts have knocked back a takeover in the industry on competition grounds.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington ruled late on Wednesday that the effect of the tie-up between Anthem and Cigna “may be ‘substantially to lessen competition’” in “what is already a highly concentrated market”, particularly in the market for the sale of commercial health insurance to “national accounts” – customers with more than 5,000 employees, typically spread over two or more states.The ruling follows US District Judge John Bates’ decision in Washington DC late last month to block Aetna’s $37bn takeover of rival Humana, also on the grounds that deal would reduce competition.Judge Jackson noted that the claimed medical cost savings, championed in particular by Anthem, were not “merger-specific, they are not verifiable, and it is questionable whether they are ‘efficiencies’ at all.”The merger, first announced in 2015, between Anthem and Cigna – the second- and third-largest medical insurers in the US – has been on shaky ground for months.

26;CI;Cigna Corp;2017-02-05T13:37:24Z;US health insurers give notice on Obamacare marketplace;With lawmakers set to repeal healthcare reform, Aetna, Anthem and Cigna reassess role;Three of the biggest US health insurers have warned they could withdraw from the marketplace that enabled 20m Americans to purchase their own cover, as lawmakers in Washington scramble to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform law.Such a move could leave many Americans without access to any health insurance options in 2018, if lawmakers are unable to implement a short term Obamacare improvement or a replacement law. Joseph Swedish, Anthem’s chief executive, told investors last week that the company “needs certainty about short-term fixes” in order to determine the extent of its participation in the market next year. “If we can’t see stability going into 2018 with respect to either pricing, product, or the overall rules of engagement, then we will begin making some very conscious decisions with respect to extracting ourselves.”Aetna chief Mark Bertolini took a stronger stance, saying the insurer had “no intention” of being in the market in 2018. He added that the company would participate “where we think it is appropriate” next year. David Cordani, chief executive of Cigna, said they would assess whether to participate and to what extent by the spring.“If the marketplace is really unstable and a lot of insurers drop out, it means that a lot of people who depend on getting coverage through the marketplace are going to be left out in the cold,” said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national healthcare consumer advocacy organisation.Insurers must submit their 2018 rates for the exchanges by the spring, but many fear lawmakers in Washington will not move in time to reform, even temporarily, key aspects of the law. “If nothing is in place, then all chaos will ensue,” said Sherry Glied, an economist and dean of New York University’s Robert F. Wagner graduate school of public service. “Some certainty, at least for one year, has to be injected into the system.”Health insurers have struggled to make a profit on the Obamacare exchanges since they opened in 2013. Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group abandoned some exchanges altogether in 2016, claiming they contained too many sick members and not enough young and healthy ones to be profitable.The ability for insurers to manage risk in each of the exchanges could deteriorate further, if Congress removes the individual mandate that requires every American to buy insurance. Mr Bertolini told CNBC that the earliest he expected a new health insurance programme would be January 2019. House and Senate committees convened for hearings late last week to discuss steps to reform Obamacare.But the individual market is only one piece of the broader US health insurance business. Analysts point to healthy growth in the government services segment, especially Medicare and Medicare Advantage, as the elderly population increases.“Medicare is in a good place,” said Ana Gupte, a managed care analyst at Leerink Partners. “It’s clear Republicans are in favour of private coverage.”Aetna expanded its Medicare Advantage programme, the alternative to government-sponsored health insurance for senior citizens, by 111,000 members in 2016, and its Medicare supplement business by 119,000 members. Anthem expects to grow Medicare by 75,000 members in the coming year, primarily in the Medicare Advantage segment. Anthem and Cigna shares have largely outperformed the S&P 500 index since Donald Trump’s election. Aetna stock dipped below the broader market in January, when a US court ruled against the company’s proposed $37bn takeover of Humana, calling it anti-competitive. The company is considering an appeal. Anthem awaits a federal-court decision on its $48bn acquisition of Cigna.
27;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-11-30T20:33:02Z;Fitch predicts headwinds for major US health insurers in 2017;;"Prognosis: not so good.Concerns about a wave of mega-mergers and the profitability of plans sold on Obamacare exchanges could make the coming year a challenging one for major US health insurers, Fitch analysts said in a note on Wednesday.The ratings agency said that it had negative rating and sector outlooks for US health insurers, and that it expects “more health insurer rating downgrades than upgrades” over the next 12-24 months.“Leverage concerns tied to large mergers and concerns about the profitability of business sourced from health insurance exchanges are the key factors underlying Fitch’s negative outlooks,” said Fitch Ratings senior director Mark Rouck.It’s been a shaky year for many of the largest US health insurers, which have grappled with the implementation of President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform legislation, the Affordable Care Act – also known as Obamacare – and are now scrambling to figure out what will come next if Republicans follow through on their promises to repeal and replace portions of the law.While the law has expanded the number of Americans with health insurance, several of the largest insurers have already reported heavy losses as a result of plans sold on the exchanges set up under Obamacare, and had previously announced plans to pull back Obamacare offerings in all but a few markets.While a Republican repeal-and-replace could be a longer-term credit positive for the sector, Fitch said that “significant near-term uncertainty” exists about what shape those efforts could take.Another question mark that will linger over four of the five largest US health insurers until early next year are US antitrust officials’ lawsuits seeking to block to two mega-mergers. The first, Anthem’s $48bn bid for Cigna, is already on trial. The other, a proposed $37bn tie-up between Aetna and Humana, will go to trial later this month.But far from being a must-win for insurers, Fitch said that if the government wins and the deals are blocked, the resulting effect of acquirers “foregoing acquisition financing” would likely result in its removal of negatives watches on those companies’ ratings. “Given the size and significance of the companies involved this may be sufficient to contribute to a change in the sector’s rating outlook to stable,” Fitch said in the note.Compared to a year ago, Anthem’s shares are up 9 per cent; Aetna has risen 27 per cent, Humana has increased 25.1 per cent and UnitedHealth is up 40.5 per cent. Cigna is the only one of the big five insurers to be down, decreasing a modest 0.2 per cent from this time last year."
28;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-11-21T18:27:22Z;US health insurance mega-mergers on trial – key dates to watch;;"Four of the five largest US health insurers are headed to court to try to salvage two mega-mergers from being blocked by federal and state competition authorities, who claim that the deals will stifle innovation and consumer choice.Opening arguments kicked off in federal court on Monday in a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice and several states’ attorneys generals seeking to stop Anthem from completing its $48bn purchase of rival Cigna.In just a few weeks, before a different judge in the same Washington, DC court, attorneys for Aetna and Humana will head to trial to try to save their proposed $37bn tie-up. The insurers say that their deals will help them innovate and reduce costs, while federal and state authorities say that the wave of consolidation will stifle competition to patients’ detriment.Antitrust officials sued to block the planned deals earlier this year. The closely watched trials come as the US health insurance industry attempts to realign itself after sustaining heavy losses on plans offered through the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health-insurance reform legislation whose fate now hangs in the balance as Republicans prepare to retake the White House.Here are some key dates to watch:November 21 – Opening arguments begin in the Anthem/Cigna trial before US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. federal court. She will first hear evidence and testimony on how the proposed deal would affect the overall national health insurance market.December 2 – Both sides in Anthem/Cigna will submit their proposed findings – intended to underscore trial evidence and testimony they hope will guide the judge in drawing her conclusions – for the first phase of the trial.December 5 – Trial begins for the Aetna/Humana merger before US District Judge John Bates in Washington, DC. The Anthem/Cigna trial will take the week off.December 12 – Testimony resumes in Anthem/Cigna, in a second phase that is expected to focus on the deal’s implications for local commercial markets and healthcare rates.December 29 – Parties in the the Aetna/Humana case are scheduled to submit their proposed findings to the judge.December 30 – Closing arguments scheduled for the Aetna/Humana trial before Judge Bates. The Anthem/Cigna trial is also scheduled to end by this date.December 31 – Original closing date for the Aetna/Humana merger; Aetna’s executives said on a recent conference call that they now expect the deal to close sometime in 2017. The company will owe Humana a $1bn termination fee if it does not clear the final hurdles.January 4 – Parties in the Anthem/Cigna trial will file their proposed findings from the second phase of the trial to Judge Jackson.January 31 – Original closing deadline for Anthem/Cigna merger. However, the parties have the option to extend that to April 30, 2017. Anthem is on the hook for a $1.85bn termination fee if the deal fails to close.End of January 2017 – Judge Jackson is expected to issue her ruling on Anthem/Cigna by the end of January, Anthem’s chief executive said on a recent conference call with investors. There is no indication about when Judge Bates will rule on Aetna/Humana, although all of the insurers have argued for a speedy resolution to help part the clouds of uncertainty that the litigation has created."
29;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Health insurance stocks rally with Obamacare’s future in doubt;;Shares of a number of large US health insurers rose on Wednesday, in the wake of the election of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has pledged to repeal his predecessor Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act legislation.By mid afternoon, shares of four of the five largest US health insurers were in positive territory. Humana and Aetna’s stocks each rose more than 4.5 per cent, and Cigna gained 4.8 per cent. Anthem was up 2.1 per cent, while the largest of the five, UnitedHealth Group had pared some of its earlier losses to trade down 0.4 per cent.Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act has been dubbed, has been a mixed bag for these insurers. Since the law was enacted in 2010, 20m Americans have gained healthcare coverage, according to government estimates. But the influx of more people into the coverage pool has squeezed insurers, with several of them posting substantial losses as a result of plans offered on the Obamacare exchanges and eyeing an exit from some states’ markets. Recently, the US government said it expected insurance costs under Obamacare to jump by an average of 25 per cent next year.Republicans in Congress have attempted to repeal Obamacare numerous times, railing against its mandate that people buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty. But with Mr Trump in the White House, and Republicans winning majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives on Tuesday night, the odds of a rollback could be improving. This was underscored by comments from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who told Politico on Wednesday that repealing Obamacare is “pretty high on our agenda”.The “extent to which the president-elect’s policies will coincide with traditional Republican policies, given the limited number of his detailed and articulated positions at this time, remains to be seen,” wrote Fitch analyst Megan Neuburger in a note. “Successful efforts to repeal or materially replace the ACA would be a credit negative for healthcare providers as it is contributing to higher volumes of insurance patients.”But, she added:“Over the longer-term, healthcare companies will continue to invest in growth opportunities, as the fundamental outlook for the US corporate healthcare industry remains positive despite the election outcome…A repeal of the ACA may slow the nascent evolution toward value-based reimbursement schemes, but Fitch believes the shift toward linking pricing to patient outcomes will continue as patients and health insurers grapple with the growing burden of healthcare costs over the longer term.”

Such efficiencies don’t happen overnight; they require co-operation over months (if not years) to integrate the operations of these multibillion-dollar firms,” the DoJ said.“Because the breach letters reveal the current state of hostility between defendants, the letters evince barriers to integrating these firms and are relevant” to the defence’s case, said the DoJ.Anthem and Cigna declined to comment on the DoJ’s filing. Publicly the two companies have said they would fight the DoJ and continue to try to complete the deal.Anthem will be forced to pay $1.85bn if the deal falls apart. Anthem said in a separate filing earlier this year that Cigna would walk away if it cannot close the deal by April 30, when the transaction terms expire."
31;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-08-17T16:54:41Z;Aetna threatens to quit exchanges if Humana deal is blocked;Insurer is latest to pull ‘Obamacare’ plans, which it blames for millions of dollars in losses;Aetna, the US health insurer, threatened to pull out of exchanges where Americans can buy affordable coverage if regulators tried to block its $37bn takeover of a rival, escalating a dispute over its decision to scale back its commitment to Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform.Aetna on Monday became the latest insurer to pull its plans from affordable marketplaces, arguing it was losing hundreds of millions of dollars on policies sold through the exchanges. The company said it would stop selling plans in 11 of the 15 states where it operates and cancel its expansion plans.The public healthcare exchanges were launched in 2013 and were quickly billed as one of the biggest achievements of the Affordable Healthcare Act. Almost 13m Americans are covered by the plans, many of whom were previously unable to afford a commercial policy, or turned away by insurers for being too sick.However, the private insurers who sell plans through the marketplace have complained they are incurring significant losses, because the people who have signed up are much sicker and older than expected. Two of the largest insurers, UnitedHealthcare and Humana, recently announced plans to scale back their commitment to the exchanges.Aetna’s decision to pull back from the marketplace comes just weeks after the Department of Justice tried to block its $37bn takeover of Humana, and quickly sparked accusations that it was punishing the Obama administration for torpedoing its deal.Those accusations grew louder on Wednesday after a letter from Aetna to the DoJ was leaked, in which the insurer warned it would have to reduce its commitment to the exchanges if the deal was held up, and pull out altogether if it was ultimately blocked.“Instead of expanding to 20 states next year, we would reduce our presence to no more than 10,” said the letter dated July 5, which was signed by Mark Bertolini, Aetna chief executive. “It is very likely that we would need to leave the public exchange business entirely . . . should our deal ultimately be blocked.”Aetna did not respond to a request for comment.It is very likely that we would need to leave the public exchange business entirely . . . should our deal ultimately be blockedLast month, the DoJ filed a lawsuit to block the deal, and a second transaction: Anthem’s $48.6bn takeover of Cigna. Aetna and Anthem have vowed to appeal.Officials argued the consolidation would turn the health insurance market from one with five big players to three, with dire consequences for consumers and employers who foot the bill for the private system.In a Facebook post, Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator for Massachusetts, accused Aetna of using “the health of the American people . . . as a bargaining chip to force the government to bend to one giant company’s will”.However, critics of the Affordable Care Act, often dubbed ‘Obamacare’, seized on Aetna’s decision to pull back from the exchanges as further proof that the president’s landmark healthcare law is fundamentally flawed and needs to be repealed and replaced with something else.“Another health insurer is pulling back due to persistent financial losses on Obamacare plans,” tweeted Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.John McCain, the Republican senator for Arizona, said Obamacare was “unravelling at a rapid rate,” and warned “we’re going to have to go back and not only repeal, but replace and make healthcare available to every American.”In an interview with the Financial Times in March, Mr Bertolini said the Affordable Care Act “wasn’t going to be a disaster” and that the exchanges were “a very small portion of our business”, while calling on Republican and Democratic politicians to work together to improve the legislation.“If you look at every other social programme we’ve implemented through the New Deal, through the Great Society programmes, we always touch those programmes every year and make them better,” he said. “We have not touched this programme.”
32;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-08-05T16:32:56Z;US health insurers: knock on wood;There is nothing to fear but mean reversion;A casual reader of headlines might conclude that the US health insurance industry was in a nasty fight with a government determined to foil it. The feds are suing to stop mergers that would join four of the five largest players (the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals). And UnitedHealth, biggest of all, has all but walked out on the individual insurance exchange business, a cornerstone of Obamacare.Any such impression would be wrong. The industry is on a multiyear run of rising profits and share prices. Government-sponsored programmes have been the main source of growth.Since Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, shares of the five biggest insurers have all outperformed the S&P 500. The two largest by market cap, UnitedHealth and Cigna, increased revenues and free cash flow at double-digit compound rates over the period.The key in this bonanza has been sedate US medical cost inflation, which protects underwriting returns. This trend has traditionally corresponded with economic growth, but the link seems to have weakened in the latest recovery. The market apparently expects this forgiving trend to continue. Aetna’s price/earnings ratio, for example, has risen from nine to 15.Another helpful trend was the surge in managed plan enrolment by beneficiaries of Medicare (the programme for the old) and Medicaid (for the poor). At UnitedHealth and Aetna, member growth has compounded at double digits in both plans. Obamacare significantly expanded Medicaid membership. Compared with these programmes, the healthcare exchange business is a footnote.Can the prosperity continue? Put aside the merger issue. Medicaid won’t expand again, but the growth in managed care by government plans seems set to continue. The cost trend is trickier. It did tick up a bit in 2014, the most recent year for which data are available. And when a trend break is hard to understand, the conservative approach is to bet on mean reversion.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
33;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-07-31T15:09:13Z;The American consumer’s impotent rage;People sense that service providers pay more attention to regulators than to disaffected customers;Ask any American if they have lost their temper recently and there is a good chance it was on the phone to one of their service providers. Whether they were venting their spleen at a cable service company, a cell-phone operator, an airline or a health insurer hardly matters. What unites them is the impotent rage that comes from knowing how little you can do to punish the company in question.There was a time when the US consumer was still king. In most service markets, however, those days are over. If you are looking for a key to the American voter’s rage, keep in mind that the consumer is the same person. Most consumers — a steadily rising share according to surveys — are prone to moments of Trumpian rage nowadays. Lashing out usually makes things worse. But that is what people who feel powerless are liable to do.Many people’s instinct is to blame free markets for their sense of consumer impotence. In fact, the problem stems from lack of competition. Much like in politics, where congressional boundaries are rigged in favour of incumbents, most large US service sectors are dominated by a shrinking handful of players.Sectors where the top four companies have markedly increased their market share in the past decade — and thus their scope to treat consumers with impunity — include telecoms, information technology, transport, retail services and banking, according to a survey by The Economist. If you are still wondering why Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump did so well — taking more than 40 per cent of the two parties’ primary votes between them — both talked of how US politics is rigged. It is no accident that most Americans think the same about their economy.They have sound reasons to do so. The last people to grasp that things have gone wrong are the wealthy, the well-connected and the cognitive elites, which includes half the denizens of Washington. The wealthy’s share of the economy has risen sharply since the start of the century. The share of corporate profits in the economy has also soared.If you are rich you can afford what used to be normal for everyone — the privilege of interacting with human beings. Thus, high net worth individuals receive personalised banking, where your bank manager knows your name and needs. The wealthy also benefit from so-called concierge health services, which come with a human face. Many oligopolistic service providers keep clandestine lists of VIP customers who need not wade through robotic software before reaching a customer service agent. When they pick up the phone, a human answers.Ordinary consumers, much like most voters, know there are different rules for them. They also sense that the big service providers pay more attention to Washington regulators than to their disaffected customers. It is a perfectly rational thing to do. America’s capital is where the markets are rigged, after all.Politicians rank their priorities in much the same order. Voters come low on their list. Lawmakers devote chunks of their schedules to raising money from donors. In most districts, the voter barely matters since gerrymandering has rigged the election in favour of one or other party. Politicians with large war chests are far less likely to be challenged for their party’s nomination. The same logic leads companies to keep a strong lobbying presence in Washington.So what can people do? As consumers very little. If United Airlines keeps bumping you off flights, you might shift your mileage account to Delta or American. But your chances of mistreatment will not fall. Ditto for those who switch their health insurance from Cigna to Aetna, or their broadband from Comcast to Verizon. Perhaps you can start a new company? Alas, what goes in Silicon Valley for people seeking funding for social media start-ups does not apply to markets with high barriers to entry. America’s big four airlines might provide dismal service to most customers. But they are Olympic champions at stopping “open skies” competition.Maybe you should just shout at customer representatives? That is what many people do. But it usually backfires. Besides, on the rare occasions you reach a human, they are the last people you should berate. America’s mostly outsourced contact services industry is staffed by people reading instructions from a software manual. Every minute of their time is monitored. Consumers are not just voters — they are employees too.There are no easy ways to reduce market concentration, just as there are no easy fixes for corporate America’s grip on politics. But there are two simple ones. The first is to metastasise your consumer rage by voting for Mr Trump. This is the man who is best known to most Americans for saying “you’re fired” on television. For every problem America faces, he has a solution that is clear, simple and wrong. The second is to support aggressive antitrust action. Since Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency, trustbusting has a great history. It could also have a great future.Alas, no presidential nominee has yet found the conviction to champion breaking up the monopolies. The more is the pity. Taking on the titans would not just be great populism. It would also be smart policy.edward.luce@ft.com
34;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-07-29T10:51:01Z;Cigna slashes profit forecast as Anthem deal hangs in limbo;;Cigna slashed its full year earnings guidance on Friday after the the US health insurer delivered second quarter results that came in well short of analysts’ expectations.The news is expected to raise questions over Cigna’s prospect as a standalone company should its proposed $48bn takeover by rival Anthem gets blocked by US anti-trust regulators.Cigna blamed problems in its group disability and life insurance unit for the disappointing results. The unit fell into a $12m operating loss for the June quarter, compared to a $106m profit in the prior year period.Cigna said it expects pressure on the business to continue and as a result it now sees full year adjusted earnings at $7.75-$8.10 a share, a sharp leg down from its previous forecast of $8.95-$9.35 a share.“The Group Disability and Life business significantly underperformed our expectations in the second quarter,” the company said, adding:We are taking a series of corrective actions to stabilize and improve Group Disability and Life results while we continue to focus on driving innovation and enhancing value for our customers and clients around the globe, and remain fully committed to our long-term growth objective.Revenue for the quarter rose 5 per cent to $10bn. However, net income fell more than 13 per cent to $510m amid problems in the disability and life units and after the insurer took a series of one off charges, including a $26m after tax charge related to the Anthem deal.Excluding these, adjusted net income was $515m, or $1.98 a share, sharply down from the $664m, or $2.55 a share reported in the prior year period and well below the the $2.37 the market had predicted.Shares in Cigna have fallen by more than 7 per cent since the US Justice Department announced last week that it was suing to block the insurer’s merger with Anthem.
35;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-07-21T17:20:14Z;US justice department moves to block health insurance megamergers;DoJ files lawsuits to prevent Anthem’s $48.4bn takeover of Cigna and Aetna’s $37bn purchase of Humana;The US Department of Justice on Thursday moved to block two health insurance megamergers worth a combined $85bn, warning the deals would hurt competition and reduce the quality of care received by millions of patients.The DoJ said it had filed lawsuits to prevent Anthem’s $48.4bn takeover of Cigna and Aetna’s $37bn purchase of Humana, two deals that would have reshaped the private US healthcare system and shrunk the market from five big insurers to just three. Ten state attorneys-general also joined the DoJ’s efforts to block the mergers.“Competitive insurance markets are essential to providing Americans the affordable and high-quality healthcare they deserve,” said Loretta Lynch, the US attorney-general.She added: “These mergers would restrict competition for health insurance products sold in markets across the country and would give tremendous power over the nation’s health insurance industry to just three large companies.”The planned tie-ups are the latest in a string of big-ticket takeovers that have been thwarted by antitrust officials in the Obama administration, which has taken a much more active role in blocking large mergers and acquisitions than previous governments.Anthem accused the DoJ of basing its decision on “flawed analysis” and said it was “fully committed to challenging the DoJ’s decision in court”. The health insurer is required to pay Cigna a break fee of $1.85bn if the deal falls apart, even at the behest of regulators.Aetna also said it would “vigorously defend” its planned deal and that it was looking forward to making its case in court, “where a judge will review the transaction based on its merits”. The company would owe Humana $1bn if the tie-up were thwarted by antitrust officials.The DoJ said it was particularly concerned that Cigna and Humana, the smallest of the big five insurers, would disappear from the market, describing them as “two innovative competitors” and warning that their takeover would hinder efforts to reform the bloated US healthcare system.When the deals were hatched a year ago, many in Washington predicted the DoJ would eventually wave them through despite competition concerns, in an effort to support the 2010 Affordable Care Act.Health insurers have argued the law, commonly known as Obamacare, has made it harder for them to make a profit and said they need to consolidate in order to drive down costs and secure better terms from hospitals, doctors and drugmakers.But the DoJ said the mergers would reduce competition on the new public health insurance exchanges, which have provided coverage to more than 16m Americans who were previously uninsured, while also limiting choice for large employers that offer employee healthcare plans.So far under the Obama administration, the total value of large US deals abandoned following government intervention to either protect competition or block a company from moving its tax base abroad has risen to about $500bn, according to a Financial Times analysis.This year alone, the DoJ has torpedoed a $38bn merger between oilfield services companies Halliburton and Baker Hughes, while new tax rules introduced in 2016 by the government forced Pfizer to jettison its planned $160bn acquisition of Allergan.Several bankers and lawyers have criticised the administration for being anti-business, after a big increase in enforcement of antitrust rules amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions over the past two years.But others argue that the recent spike in blocked deals has more to do with the M&A cycle hitting a peak, as companies attempt to pursue larger deals that are riskier from an antitrust perspective.“The Obama administration is no more confrontational than previous Democratic administrations,” one lawyer told the FT ahead of the DoJ’s ruling on Cigna-Anthem.In the first six years of the administration, the DoJ, which together with the Federal Trade Commission is one of the main competition watchdogs, publicly challenged on average 17 deals a year from 2009 to 2014, the last year for which data are available.
36;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T06:59:53+0000;US sues to block Anthem, Aetna mega mergers;;The US Justice Department on Thursday moved to block a pair of giant health insurance mergers worth a combined $85bn, the latest mega-deals to fall within the Obama administration’s crosshairs.US antitrust officials are suing to prevent Anthem from acquiring Cigna and stop Aetna’s planned purchase of Humana, according to a person familiar with the matter, reports David Lynch in Washington.DoJ officials have warned in recent months they would scuttle mergers that appear likely to reduce competition in particular markets.The twin health care deals have drawn opposition from powerful Democratic senators, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, and California’s state insurance commissioner.Attorney General Loretta Lynch is scheduled to speak about what the department called “a significant antitrust matter” in Washington later this morning.
37;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-07-19T20:55:04Z;US justice department plans to block two health insurance deals;Anthem’s $48bn Cigna purchase and Aetna’s $37bn bid for Humana under a cloud;The US Department of Justice in planning to block two health insurance megamergers worth a combined $85bn amid fears that the deals would push up premiums for patients and reduce competition.Federal antitrust officials will file lawsuits as soon as this week to thwart Anthem’s proposed $48.4bn takeover of Cigna and Aetna’s planned $37bn purchase of Humana, according to a person familiar with the matter.The merger of four of the largest players in health insurance would have turned the market from a “big five” to a “big three”, in a move that many had argued would have a chilling effect on choice while pushing up costs for consumers.“That’s not a lot of competition,” said Diana Moss, president of the non-partisan American Antitrust Institute, who said that both patients with private health insurance as well as those on government-funded schemes would have suffered if the deals had gone through.A DoJ spokesman declined to comment.An Aetna spokesman said: “We don’t comment on rumours or speculation but we are steadfast in our belief that this deal is good for consumers and the healthcare system as a whole.” When the deals were conceived about a year ago, many analysts predicted the Obama administration would wave them through to support the president’s far-reaching Affordable Healthcare Act, which was passed in 2009.Under the healthcare law, known as Obamacare, many insurers were subject to limits on the amount of profit they could make from patients on government-funded schemes, prompting them to argue they needed to bulk up to survive.At the time, an adviser to Cigna said: “There is a tacit understanding in Washington that consolidation is not something they care about, as long as cost and quality can be preserved.”However, the Obama administration has warned in recent months that it would act to block deals that seemed likely to reduce competition. In May, Halliburton abandoned hopes of acquiring Baker Hughes amid DoJ opposition.There is a tacit understanding in Washington that [sector] consolidation is not something they care about, as long as cost and quality can be preservedWord of the pending government action sent shares in Anthem and Cigna down by 2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively. Humana fell 3.9 per cent while Aetna retreated 2.7 per cent. Merger partners that anticipate regulatory hurdles often try to mollify regulators with plans to spin off parts of the combined entity. But such solutions aren’t easily found in the case of big national deals, Ms Moss said.The proposed Anthem-Cigna marriage would have created the nation’s largest health insurer, measured by number of members, leapfrogging the current leader, UnitedHealth.“Negotiating a divestiture package with a firm with a national footprint is very, very difficult,” she said. “You’re basically trying to craft a remedy that would create a new national competitor.”Similar difficulties ultimately scuttled last year’s proposed Sysco-US Foods deal as well as the recent Staples-Office Depot hookup.The affected health insurers would likely sue to block the DoJ action, Leerink Research told clients. Anthem and Cigna’s chances of prevailing in court were “slim”, the company said.“It’s a tough case to litigate,” said one antitrust attorney. “I don’t love the odds.”On Wednesday, the market falls extended beyond the four health insurers in the DoJ’s crosshairs. Small health insurer shares also fell. WellCare Health dropped 0.4 per cent while Centene and Molina Healthcare were off by 0.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively.In Mr Obama’s first two years in office, proposed mergers already were eight times more likely to face a DoJ challenge than in 2005, according to a Financial Times analysis of government statistics.In 2015, the DoJ acted to block 20 deals — four times the figure from a decade ago. US companies have scrapped $370bn worth of large deals since 2009, including those abandoned in the face of a White House campaign to stem tax inversions. Justice department officials, such as Bill Baer who headed the antitrust division until April, have said publicly that Obamacare depends upon adequate competition among providers and insurers. The department’s antitrust experts also reject insurers’ arguments that they need to become larger to negotiate better with large hospital chains.Last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and six Democratic colleagues wrote to the DoJ opposing the two deals as bad for consumers. Dave Jones, California’s insurance commissioner, likewise urged the department to block the deal as anti-competitive.
38;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-07-19T15:23:20Z;Health insurers sink as DoJ said to prepare suits;;Shares in healthcare insurers were sinking fast on Tuesday after reports emerged that US anti-trust officials were preparing to file lawsuits to block two major deals in the sector.Anthem’s proposed $48.4bn takeover of rival Cigna and Aetna’s proposed $37bn tie-up with Humana are both in trouble after a Bloomberg report said the Justice Department is set to block the deals.The news sent shares in Anthem and Cigna down more than 3 per cent. Humana dropped 5.2 per cent while Aetna fell 4.3 per cent.Other smaller health insurers were also caught up in the sell-off. WellCare Health fell 2.5 per cent and Centene and Molina Healthcare were both down around 1.5 per cent.If the two deals do get blocked, it would add to the long list of big ticket mergers that have been thwarted since President Barack Obama came into power in 2009.According to an FT analysis of abandoned deals worth more than $10bn, more large M&A deals have been blocked by branches of the Obama administration than during the Clinton and Bush eras put together.In the past two years alone, the US government has blocked the $28bn tie up between Halliburton and Barker Hughes, torpedoed a $6.3bn merger between Staples and Office Depot, thwarted a $45bn deal between media giants Comcast and Time Warner Cable, crashed the $8.2bn marriage between food distributors Sysco and US Foods and derailed the proposed $200bn mega-merger of drug-making giants Pfizer and Allergan.
39;CI;Cigna Corp;2016-01-12T23:01:33Z;Lululemon jumps after holiday sales boost;US stocks climb, led by healthcare sector;Lululemon, the maker of yoga clothing, rallied on Tuesday after providing an upbeat sales outlook for the key holiday quarter.The company said late on Monday that sales for the three months to the end of January were “exceeding expectations”.The company now sees fourth-quarter sales in the range of $690m to $695m, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $679.3m.However, some Wall Street analysts remain sceptical. Jim Duffy, an analyst at Stifel, said the investment bank’s checks showed sales may be benefiting from “availability of ample clearance merchandise”, indicating higher sales could be coming at the expense of profit margins.Lululemon’s shares rallied 3.82 per cent to $56.82, cutting the 12-month loss to around 1.7 per cent.At the other end of the spectrum, Alcoa shares tumbled after the aluminium maker posted mixed fourth-quarter results after the closing bell on Monday.The company swung to a loss of $500m, from a profit of $159m in the same three-month period in 2014. The results included a $565m hit mainly due to plant closures and income tax charges.Sales slipped 17.8 per cent to $5.2bn, missing expectations of $5.3bn. Adjusted earnings per share clocked in at 4 cents a share, topping estimates by two cents.Alcoa’s shares tumbled 9 per cent, extending their fall over the past year to more than 55 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, a large copper miner, also sold off, skidding 4.64 per cent to $4.11.The energy sector also dipped, reversing course after starting the day with a solid advance.The culprit was crude oil prices. Brent, the international crude benchmark, fell as low as $30.43 a barrel — the cheapest in more than 11 years — before rallying back to $32.38, only to retreat again to settle at $30.86, down 2.2 per cent on the day.US West Texas Intermediate briefly fell beneath the $30 milestone as it traded in a similar pattern.Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, dropped 4.5 per cent to $9.19.Kinder Morgan, an energy infrastructure company, dropped 3.95 per cent to $13.60.Starbucks, the coffee chain, got a lift after it reaffirmed its commitment to the China market.Chief executive Howard Schultz said in a speech that “over time, it’s conceivable that China could become our largest market”.The shares rose 2.84 per cent to $59.46, extending a 12-month advance to around 45 per cent.Anthem said it expected adjusted earnings per share to exceed $10.80 this year, up from an estimated $10.16 last year. That compared with Wall Street expectations of $10.86 for 2016.The health insurer is in the process of acquiring Cigna in a $48bn deal. The company’s shares climbed 5.64 per cent to $135.60 on Tuesday.By the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,938.84, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed about 0.6 per cent to 16,517.52 and the Nasdaq Composite had advanced about 1 per cent to 4,686.18.The healthcare sector was the biggest gainer.
40;CI;Cigna Corp;2015-07-27T14:40:45Z;Anthem/Cigna/Aetna/Humana: Health risk;Antitrust worries and management incentives;"Anthem has an agreed deal to buy Cigna for $188 a share; Aetna and Humana have shaken hands on $230 for each of the latter’s shares. All four health insurers have expressed confidence that the deals will be good for their customers. The market is worried that US antitrust regulators might not see it that way. Cigna’s shares are at $146 and Humana’s at $182. The targets, in other words, are trading at discounts of over 20 per cent to the deal prices.Surely the companies have hired the best antitrust lawyers money can buy — who in turn believe the deals stand a good chance of going through? Why else would the companies bother?This logic, which has been offered up by at least one cheery sellside analyst, is reassuring and wrong. Anthem thinks it can wring $2bn of annual cost savings from the Cigna deal. Taxed and capitalised those are worth about $13bn. If regulators block the deal, Anthem will owe Cigna a $2bn break-up fee. Even throwing a few hundred millions in fees for bankers and the lawyers, and assigning a cost to lost management time, it would be rational for the two companies to give the deal a whirl even if they thought it had a 50/50 chance of getting through. The same logic applies to the Aetna/Humana deal, where the targeted synergies are worth perhaps $8bn and the break-up fee is $1bn.The question of how the value of the cost savings is divided between buyer and target is important, given that the break-up fee falls only on the buyer. If deal premium gives most of the value to the target, then the buyer will require a higher probability of success. But the buyer’s leadership team will also have in mind the much higher pay that comes with running a much larger company.There may be good reason to believe that both deals will sail through. But investors should not assume that the leaders of the companies involved have made an unbiased, optimistic assessment of the odds.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

If both deals are approved, the number of major US healthcare insurers would shrink from five to three.Steven Haas, partner at Hunton & Williams, the law firm, said Anthem and Cigna were under pressure to strike a deal. “In a rapidly consolidating industry, there is great risk that you end up being the last person standing and unable to compete. There was a chance of being left out in the cold.”Consolidation among health insurers has coincided with a deals boom among drugmakers and medical technology companies, with all the big groups in US healthcare facing pressure to become more efficient as Obamacare widens access to medical insurance.The Cigna-Anthem tie-up follows months of speculation and talks in which executives of the two groups had reportedly tussled over the management structure of the combined entity.The two companies said in a statement on Friday that Joseph Swedish, Anthem chief executive, would run the merged group, while David Cordani, Cigna chief, would be president and chief operating officer.Anthem said it was confident the deal would receive regulatory approval despite its size.But a person advising one of the groups had told the Financial Times that antitrust watchdogs could raise red flags given the two giant simultaneous deals. “The parties can expect a lengthy review process,” said Mr Haas.Under the terms of the agreement unveiled on Friday, Cigna shareholders will receive $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of an Anthem share for each share they hold, which the companies say values Cigna’s stock at $188 per share.Cigna shares closed at $154.26 on Thursday.Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink, said the deal was “strategically and financially attractive”.Anthem was advised by UBS and Credit Suisse and those banks also provided financing for the deal, along with Bank of America. Cigna was advised by Morgan Stanley.News of the two companies nearing a deal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
42;CI;Cigna Corp;2015-07-03T16:54:22Z;US health insurers: as good as it gets;Opportunities for buyers are flatlining as prices peak;"Good trades look so simple in retrospect. On 23 March 2010 the US Affordable Care Act — Obamacare — was passed. It was designed to ensure that more Americans had health insurance. It depended on health insurers to make that happen. Action: buy health insurers. Outcome: an index of the five largest (UnitedHealth, Anthem, Aetna, Cigna and Humana) has returned 270 per cent since. The S&P has only doubled.It did not look at all simple at the time. The impact of the law’s limits on profit margins was uncertain, as was the impact of the transparent insurance exchanges it mandated. Those worries have abated and, after the last big legal challenge to the law was swept aside last week, a frenzy of deals has ensued. Anthem (second in the market, by revenue) has bid for Cigna (fourth). Centene (sixth) bought Health Net (seventh). And on Friday Aetna (third) announced it would buy Humana (fifth).Time to close the trade? Merger arbitrageurs can still wager on which deals will get closed, of course. And UnitedHealth (the number one) could present a counterbid for one of the targets, or for Aetna.But there is the risk that one or more of the deals will fail, perhaps at the hands of the antitrust authorities. And the stocks are no longer cheap.Once they traded at a big discount to the wider market; now most are at small premiums. This for organic growth in the mid-single digits. Yes, the efficiencies the deals are designed to create are still to come — but they have already been paid for in premium cash and stock bids. The simple trade now is to sell.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

The climb added more than $3bn to HCA’s market value, bringing it to $34.5bn.Universal Health Services, another large operator, also saw its shares hit a new high of $140.78 following an 8 per cent gain. Rivals Tenet Healthcare advanced 12 per cent to $56.21 while Community Health Systems added 13 per cent to $62.45.Hospital groups have been significant beneficiaries of Obamacare, which has expanded health insurance in the US. A ruling against the administration had been expected to put coverage at risk for more than 6m Americans and ripple across the healthcare industry in the form of reduced revenues and higher unpaid hospital bills.UnitedHealth Group, Anthem, Aetna, Humana and Cigna — the five largest for-profit health insurers in the country — all also rose on the news, booking in gains of between 1 per cent and 7 per cent. The ruling has fuelled speculation of further takeover talks in the sector.UnitedHealth has reportedly approached Aetna about a takeover while Cigna recently rebuffed a $53bn offer from Anthem. Meanwhile Humana, the smallest of the main insurers, has put itself up for sale in an auction that could fetch roughly $30bn.Elsewhere, Eli Lilly jumped after the US drugmaker won a patent case that bars rival Actavis from selling a generic form of its blockbuster Alimta cancer drug in the UK before the patent expires in 2021.Alimta is Eli’s single biggest selling producer. It generated $2.8bn in revenues last year — or 14 per cent of total group revenue. The verdict, which reverses a 2014 decision by the English High Court, will also apply to France, Italy and Spain under a legal system of corresponding declarations, according to Eli.Shares in the company rose 3 per cent to $84.80, extending the stock’s gain this year to 23 per cent.Another dismal quarter of sales declines and losses pushed Barnes & Noble shares 1 per cent lower to $25.94. The struggling bookstore chain saw revenue for the three months to May 2 fall more than 10 per cent to $1.18bn as sales declined across all three of its businesses. Nook, its ereader business, registered the biggest drop, with sales down nearly 39 per cent compared to a year ago. Sales at its bookshops were down 9 per cent.The broader US equity market on Thursday continued the previous day’s losses.The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 2,102.31, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 17,890.36.

44;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;US appetite for hostile takeovers hits post-crisis high;$108bn in potential deals rejected at weekend as companies look to use cheap funding;Nearly $108bn in potential deals were rejected over the weekend amid a boom in US hostile takeover attempts not seen since before the financial crisis.43%Increase in this year’s deal activity over the same period last yearCigna, the US healthcare insurer, rebuffed a $54bn offer from larger rival Anthem, while Williams, the gas pipeline operator, turned down a $53bn offer from Energy Transfer, a similar sized competitor.The rejections mean the number of hostile deals launched by US companies since the start of 2015 has doubled since the same period last year, from 20 to 40, according to Thomson Reuters data.The increase comes at a time when deal data are being driven by a clutch of attempted and completed megadeals, as large corporates seek to take advantage of cheap funding to tighten their grasp on their sectors. Overall deal activity is up 43 per cent with $841bn worth of transactions announced in 2015, the highest activity since 2007, the data show.Senior bankers said that the stigma of carrying out an unsolicited takeover bid had diminished as some shareholders push cash-rich companies to create value via deals rather than doing more share buybacks.“Back in the day [pre-financial crisis] if a company went hostile it had to win or its stock would suffer. Now the stigma has gone,” said Gregg Lemkau, global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs.“Now buyers are being pushed by their shareholders to make bold approaches that will help their company grow and if they fail because the seller requested an unreasonable premium it’s not a tragedy,” he said.Mr Lemkau added that shareholders of the acquiring companies are more tolerant of failed bids because they want boards to walk away from deals that become too expensive to be justified.At the same time as buyers are becoming more aggressive, boards of target companies are more willing to take the chance of holding out for better offers given the current strength of equity markets.Targets are holding out because they want to get a better deal and the strong equity market gives them the power to ask for more“Targets are holding out because they want to get a better deal and the strong equity market gives them the power to ask for more,” said Jim Head, co-head of M&A in the Americas at Morgan Stanley.Last weekend’s events follow a string of other large contentious takeover battles, including Monsanto’s $45bn bid to win control of Syngenta, the Swiss agricultural chemicals group, and Teva’s $40bn offer to secure rival generic drugmaker Mylan.“Battles are becoming more hostile because nobody wants to be left alone with nobody else to consolidate,” said Mr Head. “That’s why we are seeing a lot of unsolicited bids.”Cheap financing has been an enormous incentive to strike deals now, said Chris Ventresca, global co-head of M&A at JPMorgan.“A company won’t buy just because the rates are low, but if there is a target they are interested in, they would rather do a deal now than later,” he said. “The economics are currently very compelling.”
45;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T06:59:53+0000;Anthem / Cigna: and your point is?;A potential merger founders for the wrong reasons;A nasty pair of letters, even by the standards of a genre known for brittle indignation. On Monday, Anthem, a gigantic US health insurer, went public with its efforts to buy Cigna, a merely huge one. In a letter to Cigna’s board (and the world at large) Anthem proposes paying $84 a share, or $54bn including assumed debt, for Cigna.That is $13bn more than Cigna was worth before deal news hit. A nice offer, in an industry with great enthusiasm for mergers. Why isn’t a deal agreed? Anthem says the deal (two-thirds cash, one-third shares) has foundered because Cigna, disregarding the best interest of its shareholders, insists that its chief executive lead the combined company, despite Anthem paying the premium and owning most of the new company. Cigna fires back that giving the keys to Anthem’s boss will not do, considering Anthem’s inferior share performance over the past half-decade, that the company “lacks a growth strategy” and instead buys back shares, and so on.Here, then, is the unhappy prospect of two companies fighting about issues at the bottom of investors’ priority lists. What matters is whether the growth and cost-cutting opportunities that the deal brings compensate for the considerable integration risks of the biggest deal in the history of the industry, in which a company with 38m customers will buy one with 15m. Anthem thinks the savings — wrung from back-office cost cutting, using scale to negotiate prices with medical providers, and so on — will hit at least $2bn a year. On the growth side, having a wider selection of products in more markets will, in theory, add growth.The $2bn savings figure is ambitious. It is larger relative to the companies’ administrative or medical spending than, for example, the savings targets in the 2012 Aetna/Coventry deal. If it is achievable, though, the savings are worth — well, well — about $13bn once capitalised and taxed.So Anthem is handing the entire putative value of the savings to Cigna as a premium. A very nice offer for Cigna shareholders, if the savings come through. They will want to know exactly where the savings are budgeted to come from. Anthem shareholders, on the other hand, will want to know about each one of the growth opportunities their company foresees — they are all that they are being offered. Told who will run the new company, both sides will shrug.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
46;CI;Cigna Corp;2015-06-21T21:47:25Z;Cigna rejects raised $53.8bn Anthem move;Groups in US healthcare insurance sector jostle for position;Cigna on Sunday rejected an increased $53.8bn bid including debt from Anthem, describing it as inadequate, as its rival seeks to emerge on top of a complex web of takeover attempts in the US healthcare insurance sector.Anthem had announced its raised offer of $184 per share over the weekend, amid a race to consolidate following the introduction of “Obamacare”.The offer, almost $29 per share above Cigna’s closing price on Friday of $155.30, represented the fourth and highest offer by Anthem, whose initial move to acquire Cigna on June 3 was worth $174.Cigna said on Sunday: “The Cigna board has unanimously determined the proposal is inadequate and not in the best interests of Cigna’s shareholders.” However, it kept open the door to a possible deal “under the right circumstances”.The new offer came as Aetna, the industry’s number three, is considering a bid to acquire Humana, and UnitedHealth, the market leader, is exploring its options. If Cigna had agreed to a deal it would be the biggest ever transaction in the managed healthcare industry, and beat CVS’s $26bn takeover of Caremark in 2006.A deal would also have seen a combined Anthem and Cigna become the top player in the sector, depending on whether UnitedHealth bought a rival.Investors and analysts say the industry is reacting to changes introduced by the Affordable Healthcare Act, which has provided health insurance plans to 16m previously uninsured Americans, prompting predictions that the current crop of five large groups will shrink to three.The decision by Anthem to make its offer public came amid wrangling over whether David Cordani, president and chief executive of Cigna, would become chief executive of a merged company.The Cigna board has unanimously determined the proposal is inadequate and not in the best interests of Cigna’s shareholdersBefore Cigna’s rejection of the offer, Joseph Swedish, president and chief executive of Anthem, said in a public letter to Cigna’s board: “We were stunned that the Cigna board continues to insist on a guaranteed CEO position for Mr Cordani over choosing to allow its stockholders to realise the significant premium being offered.”In a statement he added: “With the co-operation of Cigna management and board of directors, we expect that we could reach a mutually agreeable and negotiated transaction by the end of June 2015.”Cigna hit back at Anthem on Sunday, criticising Mr Swedish, who would have become chief executive, president and chairman of the board under Anthem’s most recent proposal, as well as leading the integration team.“Your insistence that one person (Joseph Swedish) assume four roles …is disconcerting and risky,” said Mr Cordani in a letter to Anthem’s board co-signed by Isaiah Harris Jr, Cigna chairman.However, Cigna remains open to the two companies joining.“A combination involving Anthem and Cigna under the right circumstances has the potential to bring together our complementary strengths in a manner that would provide substantial benefits to both consumers of healthcare services and healthcare professionals, while delivering immediate and sustainable economic returns to shareholders,” the letter said.UBS and White & Case are advising Anthem. Morgan Stanley and Cravath, Swaine & Moore are advising Cigna.Additional reporting by James Fontanella-Khan
47;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Anthem makes $45bn offer for rival Cigna;Health insurance industry consolidation spurred by Obama reforms;Anthem has started a complex takeover war in the US health insurance industry by making a $45bn approach for Cigna as the sector prepares for a wave of consolidation spurred by the introduction of “ Obamacare”.Anthem has tentatively offered $175 a share for Cigna, a premium of 27 per cent over the company’s closing price on Friday, valuing the fourth largest health insurer at almost $45bn excluding debt, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Cigna rebuffed the offer, one person said.A deal would torpedo a possible tie-up between Cigna and Humana, the smallest of the main insurers, which has put itself up for sale in an auction that could fetch roughly $30bn. Aetna, the industry’s number three player, is also said to be interested in Humana, while UnitedHealth, the market leader, is exploring its options.The flurry of takeover talks comes as analysts predict the US health insurance industry will shrink from five large groups to three, as companies try to position themselves for changes being ushered in by the Affordable Healthcare Act, the signature reforms of President Barack Obama.If consummated, a takeover of Cigna by Anthem would be the biggest ever transaction in the managed healthcare industry, trumping the $26bn that CVS paid for Caremark in 2006. Anthem’s offer was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Insurers have shied away from big-ticket mergers and acquisitions since Mr Obama outlined his healthcare reforms in 2009, preferring to wait and see how the new legislation would affect their prospects.Since then, investors and analysts have said the enrolment of more than 16m uninsured Americans into health insurance plans has created opportunities and challenges. Shares in Anthem have increased 55 per cent in the past twelve months, while Cigna’s stock was up about 51 per cent before news of the offer emerged.Investors have largely shrugged off the spectre of a Supreme Court decision that could invalidate government subsidies for Americans who signed up through a federal insurance exchange, prompting millions to lose their health cover.However, the second aim of Obamacare — to reduce inexorably rising healthcare costs — could prove trickier for insurers to navigate. Faced with the prospect of lower reimbursements, hospitals and other healthcare providers have been consolidating, prompting health insurers to explore bulking up too.Health insurers are also contending with a new class of customer: the 16m individuals who are insured through the exchanges are more price conscious than those who get cover via their employers, prompting them to look for better deals.The health insurance industry has not traditionally had to deal with a large number of individual shoppers looking for the best value, and some executives fear they will not be able to protect profits unless the industry shrinks from a “big five” to a “big three”.Rampant inflation in the cost of medicines is also spurring consolidation among pharmacists and the pharmacy benefit managers who negotiate prices with drug companies on behalf of health insurers and other “payers” such as employers and trade unions.On Monday, CVS Caremark said it would buy Target’s pharmacy business for $1.9bn, helping it extract a better deal from pharmaceuticals groups. In March, UnitedHealth said it would pay $13bn for Catamaran, a pharmacy benefits manager.
48;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;UnitedHealth: changing the channel;The drug supply chain is becoming even trickier;There may be no more complicated supply chain than US healthcare delivery. And that complexity is becoming trickier to manage as the industry consolidates. On Monday, UnitedHealth, best known as an insurer, bought the pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran for $12.8bn. PBMs run prescription drug plans for insurers and companies. They have been actively sought as acquisition targets. But the buyers come from a variety of health subsectors, leading to the question of which companies are the most appropriate owners.PBMs once belonged to drugmakers. Medco, for example, used to be part of Merck. But because Medco might have been perceived to favour Merck treatments, it was spun off. That type of “channel conflict” has become a recurring theme.With an enterprise value of $70bn, the largest PBM today is Express Scripts, which bought Medco for $34bn in 2011. Express Scripts is a pure-play PBM. However, its chief rival CVS Health employs a more controversial business model — it owns a retail pharmacy chain and a PBM, Caremark. As a result, CVS once had difficulty reaching a PBM agreement with Walgreens, which is the arch-rival of the CVS pharmacy chain.For now, there is little concern about conflict questions in the UnitedHealth/Catamaran deal. UnitedHealth shares rose 2 per cent, as the all-cash deal will immediately boost earnings. UnitedHealth’s existing PBM combined with Catamaran will process 1bn prescriptions, just behind the 1.3bn that Express Scripts has now. That scale is becoming important to hold down the costs of expensive speciality drugs.Catamaran, however, generates a third of its revenue from Cigna, an insurance rival of UnitedHealth, which may not be thrilled about sending money to a competitor. The Cigna contracts runs until 2023. It may take that long to disentangle and resolve who is aligned with whom.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
49;CI;Cigna Corp;2014-02-07T22:04:03Z;Gap jumps on higher earnings hopes;US retailer records stronger than expected sales in January;Gap shares rose at their fastest pace in three months on Friday as the US retailer lifted its earnings expectations and recorded stronger than expected sales in January.The owner of Banana Republic and Old Navy said it now forecast quarterly earnings between 65 cents and 66 cents per share, ahead of guidance set last year. Gap benefited from a 1 per cent advance in same-store sales in the first month of the year, compared to Wall Street forecasts for a 1.1 per cent decline.Sales at Gap and Old Navy, the company’s two largest brands, were both up on the same month last year, while Banana Republic logged a 10 per cent drop.Glenn Murphy, the chief executive of Gap, said January’s gains left the company’s quarterly same-store sales up for the eighth consecutive quarter.“Management originally expected it to be difficult to lever expenses given the loss of the 53rd week, but was able to do so from disciplined expense control,” UBS analyst Roxanne Meyer said, referring to the change in Gap’s fiscal calendar.Gap rose 5.8 per cent to $42 at the close of New York trading.Expedia shares climbed 14.3 per cent to $74.45 to lead the benchmark S&P 500 as profits jumped 14-fold to $94.7m, or 70 cents per diluted share, in the three months to December.The company said its acquisition of Trivago, the German travel search engine, last year was paying dividends, with sales in the division rising 85 per cent from a year earlier.Net sales at Expedia, which also operates the Hotwire and Hotels.com websites, rose 18 per cent from a year earlier to $1.2bn, as hotel bookings grew 25 per cent.Analysts at more than a dozen investment banks lifted their price targets on the company, with Evercore analyst Ken Sena noting the company saw improvements across geographies.“Strong bookings performance driven by the lower-margin air business and traction within the Expedia Traveler Preference programme resulted in strong bookings trends,” Mr Sena said. “In addition, strength across brands and stability within Hotwire led to a seemingly brighter outlook on the business.”Travel booking site TripAdvisor jumped 9.5 per cent to $84.45 following Expedia’s results, while Priceline climbed 5 per cent to $1,195.Netflix shares touched an all-time high in afternoon trading as analysts at Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the company to “buy” from “hold”.Analyst Ben Mogil said Netflix would benefit in an increasingly bifurcated environment, particularly among a generation of consumers who are no longer subscribing to cable television.“In an environment where video subscribers are increasingly bipolar in their consumption patterns, Netflix remains a very attractive programming option suited towards both cord-cutters/nevers/shavers as well as heavy video users,” he said.Shares of Netflix rose 5.4 per cent to $429.98 while Mr Mogil set a $475 price target.Insurance provider Cigna weighed on equity markets, falling 9.25 per cent to $77.47 as profits slid 11 per cent from a year earlier. The company said net income totalled $361m in its fourth quarter, or $1.29 per share, compared to $406m a year ago.Cigna forecast sales would grow between 4 and 7 per cent this year, shy of Wall Street forecasts.Investors shrugged off a disappointing report from the labour department that showed the US economy added 113,000 jobs in January, below expectations for 180,000.Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist Chris Rupkey pointed to annual revisions by the agency, which showed the March 2013 employment level was 369,000 higher than earlier thought.“With the annual benchmark revision, there is more strength in the labour market than we thought,” Mr Rupkey said. “The American economy is a veritable jobs-creating machine: 2.1m in 2011, 2.2m in 2012 and 2.3m in 2013.”The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 1,797.02 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.06 per cent to 15,794.08. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite index advanced 1.7 per cent to 4,125.86.
50;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Big US health insurers wary of ‘Obamacare’ exchanges;;Some big US health insurers, including Cigna, Aetna and UnitedHealthcare, are steering clear of most of the new state healthcare exchanges amid uncertainty about the kinds of customers they might attract: namely sick ones.The three companies have said they are taking a cautious approach because they need to evaluate how the markets – set up under the “Obamacare” reforms – will work. They add that they are specialised in providing insurance to big employers, not the individuals and small businesses that will be served by the exchanges.But healthcare policy experts and analysts say that the decision also reflects uncertainty about whether the exchanges will be profitable, given how little is known about who will sign up to buy insurance on the new exchanges.“No company can predict how many of the really sick people they will get,” says Sabrina Corlette, a health policy researcher at Georgetown University. “I think the big companies are making a calculation that in the first year, a lot of the new enrollees will be sicker than the normal population and they will not be able to charge higher premiums.”The new exchanges are a pillar of Obamacare. Beginning on October 1, the online marketplaces – a sort of Expedia for health insurance – will begin selling highly regulated and in most cases subsidised insurance plans to the uninsured.Competition and the price of the products will vary state by state, but a spokeswoman for the health department said “increased competition” was leading to “affordable options and multiple choices”.The exchanges have been seen as potential goldmines for the companies, with the federal government expected to pay about $1.1tn by 2023 to subsidise the plans for millions of low-income Americans.Most experts agree that the people who will be eager to sign up first are those who are sick and most in need of insurance. Many have previously been cut out of the market because of policies – which will no longer be legal next year – that allowed companies to discriminate against patients with pre-existing medical conditions. In many states, special high-risk pools designed for sick people will be dissolved and those customers will be transferred to the new exchanges.Some employers have also discussed shifting their early retirees into state exchanges.A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2011 that sought to identify the kinds of adults that are likely to join the exchanges painted a worrisome picture for the insurance industry: a significantly greater number of expected enrollees reported that they were in fair or poor health compared with privately-insured individuals. Other experts have said that many of the new enrollees will never have had insurance before, let alone a primary care physician.“We’re pretty sure that a lot of unhealthy people are going to show up and the big unknown is how many healthy people show up,” says Tim Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law.An Obama administration official said risk adjustment and reinsurance programmes under the law were designed to offer incentives to health insurers to make sure they do not avoid enrolling customers with the greatest needs.A spokesman for Cigna, which is participating in five of 50 new exchanges, agreed that the provisions would help the company manage risk.But he added of the general sense of uncertainty: “Our view is that Christmas is coming. We’ve made our list, but we still don’t know what we are going to find under the tree on Christmas day.”UnitedHealthcare said it would participate in about 12 exchanges initially, but said the exchanges had the “potential to be a growth market” over time.A spokesman for Aetna said it would participate in up to 14 exchanges. It emphasised that it planned to position itself “for the future”.Mike Nugent, managing director at Navigant, a consultancy, says one reason these big companies are pinning their hopes on the long-term growth prospects is because employers might increasingly drop their coverage of workers within three or four years, which in turn would flood the exchanges with more healthy customers.

It is also plausible that traders anticipated such an outcome and bet accordingly.Humana shares rose 5.4 per cent to $79.11 amid high volumes.Shares in UnitedHealth Group, which were upgraded by analysts at Raymond James to “strong buy”, also rallied, adding 4.7 per cent to $61.74. Aetna and Cigna Corporation rose 3.7 per cent to $54.30 and 2.9 per cent to $64.75 respectively.The wider US stock market moved higher and the S&P 500 surpassed its previous record closing high reached last week, with sentiment boosted by better than expected factory orders data.The benchmark index advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,570.25 on Tuesday, hitting a new record high and only 6 points shy of the all-time intraday high reached in October 2007. Seven of ten main sectors were in positive territory, with gains led by healthcare stocks.“The way the stock markets treated today’s poor eurozone economic data indicates that they were pricing in a much worse outcome,” said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial.“It is slightly worrying that markets are not more concerned, given the importance of the region to trade,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, added 0.6 per cent to 14,662.01.Among consumer discretionary stocks, Urban Outfitters jumped 3.8 per cent to $39.87 after the company revealed in a 10-K filing that first-quarter comparable net sales were up in the high single-digits.Shares in Garmin, manufacturer of GPS devices, rose 5.1 per cent to $34.25 after it announced it would provide in-dash navigation for future Mercedes-Benz models.Housebuilders initially attracted buyers, with the S&P 500 homebuilder index up as much as 1 per cent in early trading. As the housing market has been slowly returning to health, boosted by record-low borrowing rates, homebuilders benefited, with the subgroup more than tripling since October 2011.Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Citigroup, is optimistic about further growth in the housing market, saying the turn in housing is being misperceived as almost over. “Given protracted stagnation in housing starts at historically low levels of activity, it would seem as if the recovery could last several years and gain strength,” he wrote in a research note.PulteGroup erased gains and was 1.3 per cent lower at $19.86, while DR Horton fell 1.8 per cent to $23.41.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite paired some of the earlier gains and closed up 0.5 per cent at 3,254.86, as its largest member Apple retreated from earlier advances to finish 0.2 per cent higher at $429.90.Shares in the iPhone maker sold off during the previous session as it bowed to Chinese pressure and issued a formal apology to consumers in its second-largest market. The stock has been declining since peaking at $702 in September 2012 and has lost more than 17 per cent since the start of the year.Nasdaq OMX shares tumbled 12.8 per cent to $27.91 as Moody’s put the exchange operator on review for downgrade.

52;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Obamacare: an unhealthy focus;Insurance investors must be careful not to focus too much on the individual mandate;If Congress required every American to own a garden gnome, you would not expect the kitsch industry to rally if the Supreme Court expressed hostility to that law. But on Thursday, following arguments in which judges hit defenders of the Affordable Care Act with pointed questions, the biggest US health insurers got a boost: UnitedHealth, Aetna, Cigna, and Humana were all up between 3 per cent and 6 per cent.That is because from the point of the insurers, the law is double-edged. The requirement that everyone buys insurance (the so-called individual mandate) is accompanied by consumer-protection rules, most notably that insurers neither reject customers, nor charge them differently, depending on their health – only according to age, family size, location and tobacco use. The market was celebrating the judges’ apparent disinclination to toss the individual mandate but not the rules. That would have killed the potential for new customers while retaining a threat to margins.But take a step back. According to the Census Bureau, 56 per cent of non-elderly Americans – those not covered by Medicare – have employer-provided insurance. They are already protected by rules like the ones the Act would apply to everyone. Another 19 per cent have Medicaid (government insurance for the poor) or other government insurance. It is only the remaining quarter of the population, individual buyers of insurance and the uninsured, who are the primary targets of the law. And many of those would be covered by the law’s expansion of Medicaid, not by private plans. The reality is that insurance profits come mostly from employer-provided insurance (and managing government plans), and this will continue regardless.Insurance investors must be careful not to focus too much on the individual mandate.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
53;CI;Cigna Corp;2011-11-03T23:34:43Z;Corporate bond sales start to pick up;Large companies line up to sell more than $12bn of bonds;Colgate-Palmolive and Mattel were among the large companies that sold more than $12bn of bonds to take advantage of a positive day in the US financial markets.A large backlog of bond deals had built up during the past few months as volatility kept corporate borrowers on the sidelines for long periods.With US stocks rallying on Thursday, bankers told companies to be ready to sell their deals when market pressures ease.Colgate, which makes consumer products such as toothpaste, and Mattel, the toy company that created the Barbie doll, were expected to sell large, multi-tranche deals that would include bonds of varying maturities. Also in the market on Thursday was Cigna, a global health insurance and health services company.Colgate sold three-year bonds that will pay a coupon of just 0.6 per cent, the lowest on record for US corporate bonds of that maturity, according to Dealogic, the data tracker. The previous low was for three-year bonds issued by Procter & Gamble in August.“What we have learnt over the last month to month and a half is that the market is volatile,” said Anne Daley, managing director in the fixed income syndicate at Barclays Capital. “When the window looks open, you should move quickly.”The corporate bond market has recently seen days of little or no issuance, followed by spurts of heavy issuance, in an extension of the risk on-risk off trade.The euphoric mood in the wake of the eurozone deal to tackle the region’s problems last week allowed investment-grade companies to sell almost $14bn of debt in the US on October 27, the busiest session since March.Issuers then included financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, which had been hard hit by concerns about the extent to which Europe’s festering debt crisis could infect banks in the US.Last week also marked the busiest since July for junk bond sales as investors poured record amounts of cash into US funds that buy this type on debt.On Monday, Cablevision priced junk bonds for a refinancing that was said to be sidelined for some time.Borrowers also were eager to sell their bonds on Thursday ahead of the release of the widely watched monthly employment report for the US, which often dictates market sentiment.“A backlog has been building and a number of issuers want to get deals done before the end of the year,” Ms Daley said.Investors also were expecting more high-yield or junk bonds and two such deals priced on Thursday, Dealogic said.“With improving market conditions, we have seen increased interest from issuers to access the market and the shadow calendar is growing,” said John Cokinos, head of leveraged finance capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Taleo Corporation, which sells human resources software to businesses, was up 7.9 per cent to $31.61. SuccessFactors, which markets business education courses, rose 9.3 per cent to $26.24.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.4 per cent to 2,699.44 at the close.The S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent to 1,254.20, its highest close since the start of August, and decisively above the 1,220 to 1,230 range where two previous rallies stalled in recent months.The Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 closed below 30 for only the second time since early August. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” had been above 30 for most of August and September.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 11,900.03.“EU debt negotiations didn’t go off the rails over the weekend, and it appears that some progress may have even been made toward an agreement,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The rally was broadly cyclical with material and industrial stocks in the S&P 500 up 2.3 and 1.7 per cent respectively. Both sectors were helped by a better than expected “flash” purchasing managers’ index survey in China.Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies China with metallurgical coal for use in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.5 per cent to $23.79. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan was 8 per cent higher at $23.79.The defensive utility, telecom and consumer staples sectors were the only S&P 500 components to fall.Caterpillar surged 5 per cent to $91.77, after the company reported record revenues and delivered earnings per share of $1.71, a full 15 cents higher than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.The company raised its 2012 earnings outlook by a fifth, and said global economic uncertainty had not fed through to demand for its earthmoving equipment.Shares in health insurer HealthSpring surged 33.7 per cent to $53.71, after rival insurer Cigna announced it would purchase the company for $3.8bn.The deal values HealthSpring at $55 a share, and would give Cigna access to HealthSpring’s customer base. HealthSpring sells premium insurance to customers eligible for Medicaid, the federal health insurance programme for retirees. Cigna shares were down 0.6 per cent to $45.34.The deal helped Humana, another health insurer focused on Medicare-eligible clients, gain 4.8 per cent to $79.93.In the property sector, Citigroup analyst Josh Levin released a note arguing that “the structural excess supply of homes is exhausting itself.“The inventory of existing homes for sale [3.48m in September] has been declining on a year on year basis for the past eight months and now stands at a multiyear low,” Mr Levin told clients.Although he warned the “shadow inventory” of homes in foreclosure could yet add to the housing stock, homebuilder shares continued their strong October rally.The SPDR Homebuilders exchange traded fund, which tracks the return on homebuilders listed in the S&P 500 was up 2.9 per cent to $16.49. The ETF has risen 30 per cent in three weeks, after hitting a low of $12.30 at the start of October.Lennar Corp, considered one of the healthiest of US homebuilders because of its low debt levels, was up 1.7 per cent to $17.02, a gain of 33.6 per cent since October 4. PulteGroup, a more volatile stock carrying high debt, was up 6.3 per cent to $5.21, a gain of 47.2 per cent since October 4.Commercial property service provider CB Richard Ellis Group surged 9.5 per cent to $16.74.Lorillard, the maker of Newport cigarettes, fell 0.6 per cent to $114.97 after earnings per share of $1.94 came in below average analyst expectations. Gross profit of $563m was $3m lower than the same quarter last year, as higher costs offset increased sales of cigarettes and higher pack pricing.Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Kleenex and other household brands, fell 4.6 per cent to $69.65. Earnings per share of $1.26 were in line with expectations, but net income fell to $432 million compared with $469 million in the same quarter last year.Sprint Nextel was down 2.9 per cent to $2.69, as a judge weighed whether to dismiss the third-largest US mobile network’s opposition to the takeover of T Mobile by its AT&T.
55;CI;Cigna Corp;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Cigna to acquire HealthSpring for $3.8bn;;Cigna, the US health insurer, said on Monday that it acquired HealthSpring, which sells health insurance to senior citizens, for $3.8bn as it looks to capitalise on an ageing US population.Cigna will pay $55 a share for HealthSpring in a cash deal that represents a 37 per cent premium above HealthSpring’s closing share price from last Friday. To finance the acquisition, Cigna said it would issue new stock and additional debt.“The seniors market in the US is a very large market and because of demographics it will be growing in the next decade,” David Cordani, Cigna’s chief executive, told the Financial Times.HealthSpring sells Medicare Advantage plans, which are private versions of the government health insurance plans that senior citizens receive that are subsidised and come with additional benefits. The company currently has 340,000 members in 11 US states.The deal surprised some analysts, as Cigna has recently been looking to international markets for growth.“Cigna’s acquisition of HealthSpring is a surprise, not because of the seller, as Medicare has been a rapidly consolidating industry this year, but because of the buyer, as Cigna hasn’t expressed a lot of interest recently in becoming bigger in government business, with their near universal focus on growing internationally,” noted said Carl McDonald, a Citigroup analyst.Mr Cordani said that the seniors market has been the company’s second priority after international acquisitions and that it will also be looking for opportunities in the US retail insurance market.Health insurers have been consolidating after last year’s sweeping healthcare reform legislation. Ongoing legal battles have left the future of the law uncertain, but insurers have been making bets on senior care as a growth area.“Changes in healthcare reform are stimulating more change in the marketplace and more opportunities for those ready to embrace that change,” Mr Cordani said.In June, WellPoint, another health insurer, acquired CareMore, a Medicare specialist insurer, for $800m. Last month, Humana sought to boost its Medicare offerings through the acquisition of MD Care.Shares of Cigna slipped 0.56 per cent to $44.45 in midday trading, while HealthSpring’s stock price jumped 33.1 per cent to $53.47. The deal boosted the sector, with shares of Humana, Universal American and WellCare all rising.The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year and Cigna said it would add to its earnings per share within a year. Herbert Fritch, HealthSpring’s chief executive, will stay on and lead the division after the transaction is finalised.Morgan Stanley advised Cigna, while Goldman Sachs advised HealthSpring.

Although Citi analysts said this was not as bad as the industry had expected, the cuts were not yet final and could increase.Citi said it expected “there to continue to be some overhang on defence names until a deal gets done”, but the key details of defence spending would probably be released in the strategic review due in September.After the bell, the S&P 500 index fell 0.4 per cent to 1,286.95, the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.4 per cent to 2,744.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,132.49.Last week, the S&P 500 registered its worst weekly performance in a year and markets fluctuated on the news of the negotiations and the growing possibility of default.The indices were also hit by weaker-than-expected Institute of Supply Management figures indicating that the pace of US manufacturing growth was slowing.Some analysts saw some hope, at least over the short term, for bulls.“Over the near term, a solution to raising the debt limit will probably result in a strong rally, given stocks are deeply oversold and near support, which is at 1,250 to 1,270 using the S&P 500,” said Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird. “But the ramifications of GDP growth of less than 1 per cent for the first six months of the year will linger.“Looking further out, the question now becomes whether the weak economy can endure the austerity programmes planned for the second half of the year,” he said.Healthcare facilities were some of the biggest losers after Friday’s after-market news that nursing homes lost a lobbying fight with Medicare that will cost the industry more than $3.8bn next year. The federal government’s healthcare programme for the elderly is cutting its payment rate by 11.1 per cent to help compensate for overbilling.Sun Healthcare Group lost 52.14 per cent to $3.35, Skilled Healthcare Group fell to $5.06, a 42.5 per cent drop, and The Ensign Group slid 22.2 per cent to $22.09.US insurers slipped on news that the US department of health and human services had signed off on recommendations to include contraception in preventive care.While not slated to go into effect until next year, analysts said it would force insurance companies to increase premiums. The S&P healthcare sector was down 1.71 per cent.Concerns that some of the spending cuts from the debt deal will affect Medicare and other healthcare services also hit the sector.Among health insurers to fall were Cigna, down 4.3 per cent to $47.63, Aetna, off 2.9 per cent to $40.29, and United Healthcare, 3.2 per cent lower at $48.02.Humana, the US health insurer, also fell despite forecast-beating results. It reported a second-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast by more than 10 per cent but shares fell to $72.36, a 2.9 per cent loss.The company would have raised its full-year guidance further, Citi analysts said, but plans to increase non-production spending in the second half could have an impact on results.Allstate, the home and car insurer, reported a second-quarter net loss of $620m after a spring of tornadoes, flooding and other natural disasters, but the loss was less than markets had anticipated. In the quarter, losses from catastrophes reached more than $2bn, the most disclosed by any publicly traded US insurer. Its shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.34.Shares in Ford Motor rose despite news that the US car company was recalling 1.1m pick-up trucks because of a risk of the gas tank falling off and causing fires. Shares were up 1.1 per cent to $12.35.Late on Sunday, HSBC agreed to sell 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based bank, for $1bn in cash. Shares in the regional bank, which merged with NewAlliance Bancshares for $1.5bn last year, fell 2.7 per cent to $11.92.Loews, the US insurance and property group, was hit by higher catastrophe losses and lower income from its biggest holding, CNA Financial.Missing market expectations, it reported earnings per share of $0.62 versus an expected $0.74. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $39.11.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent to 12,240.11, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.05 per cent to 2,766.25.Thursday’s fall brings markets to their fourth day of losses and sets up a week likely to end in the red ahead of a weekend expected to be full of last-minute negotiations before the August 2 deadline. Friday also includes the first reading of the US second-quarter gross domestic product figures, which economists expect to increase by just 1.8 per cent, below the lacklustre first-quarter reading of 1.9 per cent.“[An] impasse in Washington and risks of inaction crept into market sentiment, leading to weakness across asset classes, including falling equity prices, slightly wider corporate credit spreads and modestly higher rates in the Treasury markets,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Capital Markets.Improved weekly jobless claims and homes sales helped to boost sentiment somewhat.New claims for jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, dropping below 400,000 for the first time since early April, though the moving average remained above the 400,000 mark. Data showed pending home sales rose 2.4 per cent in June, following an 8.2 per cent surge in May as more buyers signed contracts on houses.“This looks like very good news; a sustained drop in claims is essential if we are to be proved right in our view that the economy will rebound quite strongly in the second half,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. “Claims are noisy on a week-to-week basis even when the underlying trend is clear, and right now it isn’t.”Following Dunkin’ Donuts debut on Tuesday, Teavana closed at $27.80 in its first day of trading, a 63.5 per cent premium over its initial offering of $18. The tea retailer was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile carrier, reported a loss for the 15th consecutive quarter as more customers dropped their contracts, with its second-quarter loss registering at $847m or 28 cents a share.The results, which were significantly worse than expectations, sent the shares down sharply, falling 15.9 per cent to $4.34 – its worst day of trading in nearly three years.The carrier dragged the S&P telecoms sector down 2.2 per cent. AT&T fell 2.3 per cent, the Dow’s worst performer of the day, and Verizon lost 1.5 per cent.Motorola Solutions, the non-handset business, reported strong results with increased sales due to healthy demand in its government and enterprise segments. Its shares rose 4.7 per cent to $46.37.US insurers also gained on strong results from Aflac late on Wednesday, which reaffirmed its full-year profit outlook. Shares in the insurer rose 4.2 per cent to $45.98.Among other insurers, Aetna gained 0.6 per cent to $41.99 and Cigna added 0.4 per cent to $50.21.The materials sector fared a little better in the S&P, led by DuPont and Dow Chemical.DuPont, which was little changed up 0.04 per cent, reported quarterly profits that beat expectations on strong sales, including those of Kevlar bulletproof vests.ExxonMobil announced earnings per share of $2.18, which missed expectations of $2.30 despite a 41 per cent rise in its second-quarter profits. The world’s largest publicly traded oil company said higher oil prices helped boost second-quarter profits. Shares fell 2.2 per cent to $81.46.Colgate-Palmolive‘s results just surpassed expectations, with sales rising in Latin America by 17 per cent. Sales in North America slumped 3 per cent. Shares in the household goods company fell, down 0.7 per cent to $84.88.“While we like to see Colgate trying to restore market share momentum in the US, we are also relieved that North America represents only approximately 20 per cent of [earnings], so weakness in this region doesn’t have an overwhelming impact on overall results,” analysts at Citigroup said.Amazon, the online retailer, also reported results after the bell on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, but showed lower margins. “Ancillary growth drivers”, including the Kindle and forthcoming tablet computer, as well as market-expanding opportunities, will help offset these margins, Canaccord Genuity analysts said.Shares were 0.6 per cent higher to $223.90 on Thursday."

The Moscow premiere of Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, which opens worldwide on May 20, was the first time Disney has held such an event in Russia and a sign of the importance of the Russian market for Hollywood studios looking for growth markets, the FT reports. Box office revenues in the country have soared over the past decade to more than $1bn, rising at a compound annual rate of 27 per cent since 2006, according to Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank. The increase has been fuelled by a multiplex construction boom and growing appetite for Hollywood movies, as well as Russian-language productions.Brazil told to invest windfall wisely
Latin America’s economic boom is vulnerable to any potential fall in commodity prices and the region could suffer a crisis if policymakers did not handle the present windfall wisely, senior officials at the International Monetary Fund have said, the FT reports.

As it turned out, volumes were the lowest for a “quadruple witching” day since June 2008.“The market has been moving up on a slow grind for a while but it could potentially be followed by a violent downturn soon,” said Stephen Carl, principal and head equity trader at the Williams Capital Group, a boutique investment bank.At the close. the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent at 1,159.89, but up 0.8 per cent on the week. On Tuesday, it broke through the 1,150 mark, a key technical level.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,374.41, but 0.1 per cent higher since the start of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.4 per cent lower at 10,741.98, up 1 per cent on the week.The Dow had risen for eight consecutive sessions before its rally came to an end on Friday.The health insurance sector was in focus ahead of Sunday’s vote on the $960bn reform bill in the House of Representatives.Over the week, Cigna Corp strengthened 7.2 per cent to $37.08, Aetna was 7.6 per cent higher to $34.46 and UnitedHealth Group rose 4.5 per cent to $34.39.Google fell 1.1 per cent to $560 on Friday and 3.4 per cent over the week as speculation mounted that it was set to withdraw from China.Aircraft manufacturer Boeing, reversed mid-session gains to fall 0.2 per cent to $71.72 after saying it would ramp up production for its 777 and 747 airliners to help meet demand.Palm, a maker of smart-phones, on Friday lost 29.2 per cent to $4 after the company warned that it expected revenues in the current quarter to miss analysts’ estimates because of lacklustre demand for its latest products.The stock has fallen 40.9 per cent in the past 12 months. It was downgraded by at least five brokers.Peter Misek, technology analyst at Canaccord Adams, cut his price target from $4 to zero. “We believe Palm’s troubles will only accelerate as carriers and suppliers increasingly question the company’s solvency and withdraw their support,” he wrote in a note.Electronics retailer Best Buy rallied 1.3 per cent to $40.99 on Friday after the stock was upgraded by Goldman Sachs to “buy” from “neutral”, noting that the stock is trading at one of the lowest multiples in the US hardline retail sector, which excludes clothing.Nike rose 5 per cent to $73.52 over the week after the sportswear company reported strong third-quarter earnings that beat average analyst estimates.Net profits more than doubled and North America sales increased for the first time in four quarters.FedEx strengthened 5.1 per cent to $91.05 over the week after the package delivery group reported solid quarterly results.

61;CI;Cigna Corp;2008-09-23T18:42:29Z;Healthcare insurance rewards managing conditions;;A customer base who never gets sick but still pays its premiums is the Holy Grail for health insurers.Since this is all but impossible, many insurance companies have adopted incentive schemes, whereby the insurer offers rewards or lower premiums for anyone with a healthy lifestyle.Now a number of insurers are adopting incentive schemes and lifestyle coaching for people who have been diagnosed with chronic diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular illnesses.Bupa, the health insurer and care home group, is hoping to make a drive into treating and managing chronic diseases in the UK following its purchase last year of Health Dialog, a company that works with US health insurers that provide healthcare plans for large companies.“The insurer may come to us and say they’re interested in looking at people who have quite expensive health care because they have chronic illnesses, which don’t go away and often develop significantly over time,” said Ray King, Bupa chief executive.“They ask if we can help with helping them manage their illness so that the quality of life is better and so they go into emergency rooms less frequently.”Health Dialog works by providing telephone counselling from trained nurses, who monitor policyholders’ health and suggest ways they can improve their condition. Mr King believes one of Health Dialog’s strengths is its proprietary database, built up over 10 years. It will help Health Dialog to better predict the efficacy of different treatments used to treat people who may have a variety of different chronic conditions.Health Dialog is already doing some consulting work for primary care trusts in the UK, and Bupa is hoping to launch Health Dialog in the UK soon. The rewards for getting it right are potentially large, since Bupa’s scheme, and others like it, are exploiting two growing trends – the increasing demand for private medical insurance and the growing prevalence of chronic illnesses.Chronic diseases, including some types of cancer, are on the increase across the developed world, a consequence of lifestyle issues such as greater obesity and poor exercise, but also the result of an ageing population. In western Europe, the number of people over the age of 80 has quadrupled in the past 60 years, and the World Health Organisation estimates that at least 35 per cent of men over the age of 60 now have two or more chronic diseases.People with these diseases are more likely to require medical treatment and thus cost medical insurers more. However, most chronic diseases can be greatly alleviated by encouraging lifestyle changes such as exercise and healthy eating. Although private medical insurance in the UK does not pay for treating these diseases directly, it will have to pay for acute episodes such as hospital admissions. If insurers can improve the health of people with chronic diseases, that is is good business, improving their bottom line.PruHealth’s experience with its health incentive programme in South Africa – covering both healthy people and groups with chronic conditions – showed that people who were classified as “engaged” with their incentive programme had a claims ratios (the amount paid out compared with the amount a company receives in insurance premiums) of 53 per cent compared with ratios of 67 per cent for those who were at the less engaged “base level”.Moreover, people who over the course of five years moved from the least engaged level of the programme to the most engaged level had claims ratios roughly one-third of those who stayed at the least engaged level.In the US, where 15 per cent of the population has a chronic condition of some sort, Cigna Healthcare has one of the longest records, operating a coaching programme for people with chronic diseases for more than 10 years. About 2m people are enrolled in the programme.Chris Coloian, vice-president of health advocacy products for Cigna, says: “You can see upwards of a 6 to 8 per cent reduction in the year-on-year cost of individuals with chronic conditions when they are actively engaged in chronic disease management programmes”.Given the disproportionate effect that the chronically ill have on healthcare costs (including the healthy), this translates to a saving of between 2 and 3 per cent on claims across the entire insured population.According to healthcare industry analysts Laing and Buisson, there are 7.5m people – or 12.5 per cent of the UK population – covered by private medical insurance. Bupa has the lion’s share of this market with about 4.3m UK customers while Axa PPP comes second with about 2.5m.The private medical insurance industry makes £3.4bn in annual revenues.“The nurse is acting as the patients’ advocate,” said Ann Dougan, marketing director of Cigna, which is now offering this service to several hundred policyholders with chronic conditions.“But the nurse is also acting on behalf of the person paying for the plan, who is the employer, to make sure that the care is delivered in an appropriate setting over an appropriate time period. Basically it’s not so much a medical intervention, it’s very much a lifestyle and medical coach that you have.”Ms Dougan estimates that about 95 per cent of those on the programme show significant improvement in their health after between 12 and 18 months.The employer benefits from this in cash terms, thanks to lower premiums, and a reduction in employee hospitalisations as a result of the chronic disease. There are also benefits in productivity and a reduction in employee absences.PruHealth, a division of Prudential that insures 190,000 in the UK, has taken a slightly different tack.Its “Vitality” incentive programme gives points to healthy people for going to the gym or quitting smoking. The points can then be redeemed for cash or lower premiums. It has now altered the Vitality programme to allow people with chronic conditions to earn between 15 and 20 per cent more points for making the same healthy lifestyle decisions as people without chronic diseases.“If we get a chronic person to make the right lifestyle choices, the impact on our claims cost is obviously more dramatic [than for a healthy person],” said Shaun Mattison, chief executive of PruHealth.“Historically, if you said when filling in your application, that you were diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension, it sets alarms bells ringing. But you could argue that what we should be more worried about is not people who know they have been diagnosed with a disease, but the people who don’t know they’re diagnosed and don’t do anything about it.”
