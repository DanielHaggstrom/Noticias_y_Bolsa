0;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2019-10-24T20:00:28Z;Hyundai faces Big Tech head-on in driverless cars battle;Aptiv venture just in time as South Korean group bets $35bn on new technologies;"In a country famously obsessed with global rankings, the absence of South Korea’s Hyundai Motor in the list of the top 10 autonomous vehicle developers has rankled.The world’s fifth-biggest carmaker by sales has for years lagged behind as traditional rivals and new competitors including tech giants Google and Baidu charged ahead.But after its latest series of manoeuvres, Hyundai reckons it is now positioned to compete in what it sees as a key market that will help secure it as one of the world’s leading car groups.In recent weeks, South Korea’s second-biggest company by assets has sealed a $4bn joint venture with Dublin-based auto tech group Aptiv, pledged to have its driverless cars in commercial fleets by 2024 and promised to pour $35bn into new technologies over the next six years.Gregory Baratoff, who heads the development of autonomous vehicles at Hyundai Mobis, the group’s parts affiliate, said clinching the Aptiv deal was a “major step” that enables Hyundai to catch up. “Hyundai managed to grab a good partner, just in time. There are probably not all that many big ones left,” Mr Baratoff said.It is positioning itself to become a company that sells not just cars but also related infrastructure and technology such as the “brains” that will guide cars without drivers. The goal is to monetise all sorts of consumer data and potentially move into driverless taxis and deliveries.Hyundai is facing head-on two big decisions confronting the world’s carmakers in an industry in transition: whether to develop self-driving technology or buy it from a supplier, and whether to try to run transport services themselves or simply provide the hardware.The decisions to take ownership of its autonomous driving systems and to expand into services, say analysts, will define Hyundai’s place in an industry facing one of its biggest-ever disruptions.Hyundai’s $35bn war chest now places it “among the top companies in the automotive industry such as Volkswagen and Toyota in terms of investments in future technologies”, said Animesh Kumar, head of automotive at data group GlobalData.But the looming arrival of driverless vehicles has spawned a welter of start-ups and fuelled investments by global tech giants and governments — a transformation that threatens to dislodge carmakers from the top of the consumer food chain and relegate them to hardware providers for ride-hailing fleets operated by others.“Since [traditional carmakers] don’t have good expertise in software and related technologies, they have a fundamental fear that they will lose ground and competitiveness quickly and get overtaken by someone else,” said Seunghyuk Choi, a Seoul-based partner at McKinsey, the consultancy.Hyundai executives are acutely aware of the need to have a stake in the development of the technologies and services driving the industry’s transition to driverless cars.In an internal newsletter seen by the Financial Times, Jeonghee Kim, head of Hyundai’s newly formed artificial intelligence research lab, warned that Google, not another carmaker, loomed as the company’s biggest future rival.“Once Google takes [the] lead in the mobility market, even the most powerful automotive OEM [original equipment manufacturer] will have to fight a tough battle. You have to start something first,” Mr Kim said.In response to this challenge, Hyundai has over the past two years invested in at least 20 companies with stakes in autonomous driving, according to Dealogic data. These deals, made mostly as part of consortiums, have a combined value of about $1.5bn and range from funding rounds for Uber rivals Grab and Ola to investments in Chinese AI groups Deep Glint and Wuhan Jimu Intelligent Technology.But none gave Hyundai access to its own self-driving software platform technology, something the Aptiv deal offers.According to the latest rankings by Navigant Research, an advisory company, the companies on top of the podium among those developing automated driving systems are Waymo, a unit of Google parent Alphabet; Cruise, the self-driving division of General Motors; and Ford Autonomous Vehicles. Hyundai’s new partner Aptiv sits in fourth.Mr Baratoff acknowledged that Waymo’s technology might be “further ahead” but he argued that Hyundai — which has a strong record for low-cost, mass market manufacturing — is focused on delivering cars that are affordable, and in high volumes.“I think that aspect is sometimes missing in the Silicon Valley-based start-ups; they are very much focused on who is the best [now]. Hyundai has a very realistic and pragmatic view on what it takes,” he said.China may have the advantage that [the legislative changes] can probably mostly be done at a high level nationallyAnalysts agree that the question of commercial viability is often overlooked. But many foresee bigger hurdles in the form of government-controlled infrastructure, regulations and standards.Several national and local governments, from US states including Florida and Arizona to the UK and Singapore, are working on laws to enable driverless cars on the roads. Chinese carmakers and companies developing related software and services could end up in pole position thanks to the country’s centralised planning and vast scale.“The most important element is the legislative environment; all the liabilities, social costs, insurance, policies and laws,” said Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based automotive technology expert at consultancy Bain & Company. “China may have the advantage that [the legislative changes] can probably mostly be done at a high level nationally.”Before tying up with Aptiv, Hyundai already had a partnership with Aurora, a US start-up that also works with Volkswagen, Byton and Fiat Chrysler to build autonomous vehicles.But the South Korean carmaker also wanted to build up its own in-house self-driving tech. This desire has sparked a series of similar deals across the industry, including GM’s decision to invest in Cruise and Ford’s move to invest in Argo AI.Industry insiders caution that it is difficult to judge the progress of rival self-driving companies, though, with widely touted pilot schemes often designed to flatter a vehicle’s performance.The standard industry measure — how many miles an autonomous car drives before a human has to intervene — is also problematic, as it uses data from California, thereby excluding companies such as Ford that do not test in the state.Differing test methods further complicate matters. For instance, Waymo tests in quieter suburbs while Cruise is trialling its cars in more congested downtown areas.No carmaker has yet launched self-driving cars commercially, with early initial launch dates pushed back or abandoned.Cruise, which is also backed by Honda, planned to launch this year but has delayed its rollout. Ford, recently joined by VW in backing Argo AI, still aims for deployment at scale in 2021 while Waymo has yet to set a date for a public launch.Your crucial orientation to the billions being made and lost in the world of Asia Tech.

1;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2019-09-23T13:26:51Z;Hyundai Motor and Aptiv seal $4bn autonomous car joint venture;South Korean carmaker makes its biggest investment in an attempt to catch up with rivals;Hyundai Motor is setting up a $4bn joint venture with Dublin-based auto technology group Aptiv to develop autonomous cars by 2022. The move marks the biggest investment by the South Korean automaker in future mobility technology, as the latecomer to self-driving technology struggles to catch up with bigger rivals in the fiercely competitive field that will shape the future of the car industry.Hyundai, together with its affiliates Kia Motors and Hyundai Mobis, will invest $1.6bn in cash in the 50:50 joint venture and contribute $400m in vehicle engineering services, research and development resources and access to intellectual property. Aptiv, formerly known as Delphi Automotive, will contribute its autonomous driving technology and about 700 employees dedicated to developing autonomous driving solutions.The joint venture will begin testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and have a production-ready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers, fleet operators and automotive manufacturers by 2022. “The new joint venture marks the start of a journey with Aptiv toward our common goal of commercialising autonomous driving,” said Euisun Chung, Hyundai’s vice-chairman.The joint venture will be headquartered in Boston and led by Karl Iagnemma, president of Autonomous Mobility at Aptiv. It will have technology centres across the US and Asia. Hyundai said the joint venture’s Korean operations would serve as an efficient test bed for autonomous driving platforms, given its strong presence in the local market and the country’s advanced 5G infrastructure. Hyundai, together with Kia, is the world’s fifth-largest automaker, but has been falling behind rivals in autonomous driving and electric vehicle technologies. Last year, Hyundai announced an ambitious plan to invest $21bn in electric cars, autonomous vehicles and related technology. It has also signed many deals with technology companies in recent years to make up for its weakness in the area that is disrupting the automotive industry.The company expanded its partnership in June with Aurora, a Silicon Valley self-driving start-up. It has also signed a deal with Russia’s top technology company Yandex in March to make up ground on global rivals such as Alphabet’s Waymo, Tesla and General Motors.“The big investment in the JV, although it came a bit late, would reduce the risks of Hyundai being left behind in the race for self-driving cars,” said Lee Hang-koo, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade.Traditional automakers have teamed up with technology groups to develop connected-car software and joint platforms to stay ahead in the race to build fully autonomous cars. Toyota is working with SoftBank to develop technology, while Ford has teamed up with Chinese internet group Baidu to test self-driving cars. Volvo is supplying Uber with cars for self-driving trials. Aptiv was the first company to commercially deploy autonomous vehicles globally with its industry-leading mobility solutions. It operates more than 100 autonomous vehicles on multiple continents including the largest commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles in Las Vegas with a ride-hailing network.

He also worries, more pessimistically, that Amazon may revolutionise retail without reaping the full benefit.These are two of the best-known profit-light wonders. More unexpected, however, is that much older companies are managing to take advantage of the same indulgence from investors.Three examples on Tuesday alone: General Motors, 3M and Delphi Automotive. GM’s shares rose 3 per cent after results, reaching their highest level since the carmaker’s 2009 bankruptcy, capping a 40 per cent rise in five months. Is GM experiencing bumper sales to underpin this? Hardly. Volumes fell year-over-year in the third quarter; revenues fell 13 per cent; earnings were weak. But the start of the press release — entitled “technology and innovation” — expounded on electric and self-driving cars.Delphi is a similar winner. Though the car parts manufacturer’s revenues are on track to increase by 2.7 per cent this year, only in line with US GDP growth, its shares are up more than 40 per cent. The big jump came in May when Delphi announced it was spinning off its power train division to focus on electric cars. They rose even more on Tuesday after it announced it was acquiring nuTonomy, a small self-driving software start-up, for $450m.Finally, 3M jumped 6 per cent on Monday. Another old company, this one best-known for making household cleaning products, also enjoyed a tech-fuelled rally. At 3M, though, electronics sales rose 18 per cent in the third quarter, helped by roaring sales for insulation and other materials used in electric cars. It may no longer be required, but it is nice to see the tech effect in numbers as well as words.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

3;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2017-10-24T17:40:41Z;Delphi buys self-driving car startup nuTonomy for up to $450m;;The merger of old and new auto technology continues: Delphi Automotive is paying up to $450m for self-driving car startup nuTonomy, a Boston-based software company founded by two scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Delphi, the auto parts maker, is already deep in a restructuring designed to remake it for a very different industry than the one it has served since being spun off from General Motors in the early 1990s. A spin-off of its own, announced for early next year — involving its powertrain business — will leave it more focused on vehicle electronics, safety and autonomous systems.nuTonomy was founded four years ago by Karl Iagnemma, head of MIT’s robotic mobility group, and Emilio Frazzoli, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics, to develop a full software solution to handle autonomous driving.Delphi said the purchase will double its existing 100-person autonomous driving unit, including the addition of 70 engineers, and leave it with 60 autonomous test vehicles on the road by the end of the year. It bought another startup making software for autonomous cars, Ottamatika, two years ago, and has promised to have a full autonomous system available by 2019.General Motors, which paid $1bn for Cruise Automation, and Ford — which bought an earlier-stage startup, Argo, and promised to commit $1bn — have already made similar moves to buy the software expertise needed to develop driverless cars. Delphi said it would pay $400m upfront, with an earn-out of up to $50m.
4;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2017-05-16T11:27:35Z;Delphi teams up with BMW to develop self-driving car;;"Car parts maker Delphi is joining a BMW-led consortium that is working to develop a fully self-driving car by 2021.Last summer BMW, Intel and Mobileye joined forces to make driverless cars, with the aim of creating an industry blueprint for the technology.
The trio said at the time that other companies, both car makers and technology groups, would be welcome to join their efforts.While Intel provides the chips and Mobileye the sensors, Delphi will build systems that integrate the technology into the vehicle.One of the key challenges of commericalising driverless cars is bringing down the price of hugely expensive technology, such as laser systems, and making the currently bulky kit fit within the body of the vehicle.Klaus Fröhlich, BMW board member, said: “From the very beginning we designed our cooperation on a non-exclusive platform for this technology of the future.“With the onboarding of Delphi we significantly strengthen our development of the automated driving and do a future step in spreading this technology across the industry.”Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shashua said: “Delphi’s expertise in the field, as well as long history of integrating complex systems, makes them a very appropriate choice to join this cooperation.”Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said:In less than one year the joint teams have made substantial progress to deliver a scalable platform for autonomous driving and are on path to deliver 40 pilot cars in second half of this year.Adding Delphi as an integration partner will help to accelerate the introduction of autonomous cars on the streets from multiple carmakers and offer differentiation to customers.In March Intel announced it was buying Mobileye for $15.3bn in a move that ties the chip-maker’s future to the success of self-driving vehicles.Delphi recently pledged to focus more on driverless technology by splitting out its powertrain division, which accounts for around a quarter of the group’s revenues.Kevin Clark, Delphi CEO, said:This is a great opportunity for Delphi to use its technical depth and experience with automated driving and electrical architecture to help the cooperation develop and deploy at scale. Our close working relationship with all three partners serves as a solid foundation for a success."
5;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2016-06-15T16:45:15Z;Volkswagen plans shake-up of parts operations;German carmaker aims to reduce bloated costs after the diesel emissions scandal;Volkswagen is planning a far-reaching shake up of its sprawling operations that make components, as part of efforts to cut its bloated costs, according to two people briefed on the proposals.The initiative may form part of a new strategy due to be unveiled on Thursday by Matthias Müller, chief executive, which is partly intended to draw a line under the diesel emissions scandal.In stark contrast to many of its rivals, including Toyota, VW makes many of its components.Under the shake-up, the German carmaker is planning to draw together the various component operations that are scattered across the 12-brand group, and combine them in a single unit.Much of the component operations are centred on the underperforming VW brand.The company hopes the changes will introduce greater efficiency into the development and manufacturing of components, as well as boost the profitability of the VW brand.One person briefed on the proposals, who declined to be named, said the components unit would be required to bid for contracts with other group entities. Among other things, the idea is make the components unit compete with external suppliers.“It’s a sea change in the way these guys do business,” added this person.A second person confirmed the proposals, adding, “The complete absence of competition [has] lead to huge inefficiencies.”This person, who also declined to be named, said “If you were to align those [VW components] businesses and merge them, all the duplications would disappear”.This initiative has significant potential to boost profitability at VW because its materials costs are large.The amount VW spent on raw materials, supplies, merchandise and services rose from less than €80bn in 2010 to €144bn last year.The German carmaker is engulfed in the worst scandal in its 78-year history after it admitted to manipulating emissions test data on its diesel vehicles in the US and Europe.VW declined to comment.Matteo Fini, analyst at IHS Automotive, said VW was more reliant on in-house production of components than most other carmakers.Arndt Ellinghorst, analyst at Evercore ISI, said VW’s materials costs have risen partly because its engineers are given too much flexibility when building cars.They often use a higher grade steel than is necessary, or rely on lightweight parts that are not needed.The result is cost overruns and a multitude of customer choices of questionable necessity.“The centre of all cost problems lies within the VW brand and more specifically, the VW embedded component operation,” Mr Ellinghorst said. “Everything is totally over-engineered.”He called VW “the world’s most complex carmaker”, noting that rival carmakers, including Ford and General Motors, had integrated their components businesses and hived them off as separately-listed companies.VW is still grappling with the consequences of the emissions scandal that broke last September, when the company admitted that up to 11m cars worldwide were fitted with software that served to understate emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides in official tests.As VW prepares for its annual meeting next Wednesday, proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis both recommended shareholders oppose a vote of confidence in the company’s supervisory and management boards.Both also backed the case for a special audit of VW’s supervisory and management boards following the emissions scandal.
6;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2016-03-15T18:46:19Z;Driverless carmakers call for US rules;Patchwork of regulations holds back technology, say companies;Google, Lyft and Delphi — three pioneers in driverless cars — are urging Congress to push for uniform national rules on autonomous vehicles to replace a patchwork of state regulations that they warn could undermine the technology.In testimony submitted ahead of a Capitol Hill hearing on Tuesday, company executives asked lawmakers to empower the federal government to impose rules on issues such as dashboard controls and lane markings so driverless cars could move easily across state borders. Chris Urmson, Google’s director of self-driving cars, said: “The leadership of the federal government is critically important given the growing patchwork of state laws and regulations on self-driving cars.” Noting that 23 states had introduced 53 pieces of legislation affecting driverless cars in the past two years, he reiterated Google’s disappointment that California last December released draft rules that specifically prohibited fully autonomous vehicles. “If every state is left to go its own way without a unified approach, operating self-driving cars across state boundaries would be an unworkable situation and one that will significantly hinder safety innovation, interstate commerce, national competitiveness, and the eventual deployment of autonomous vehicles,” he said. As an example, Google is strongly opposed to rules that require fully autonomous vehicles to retain steering wheels and other manual controls, arguing that having human drivers suddenly take back control of vehicles in itself creates hazards. Lyft, the ride-hailing app that has a driverless car partnership with carmaker GM, was also testifying before the Senate commerce committee on Tuesday afternoon. Joseph Okpaku, its vice-president of government relations, said: “The worst possible scenario for the growth of autonomous vehicles is an inconsistent and conflicting patchwork of local, municipal and county laws,” he said. The leadership of the federal government is critically important given the growing patchwork of state laws and regulations on self-driving cars“Regulations are necessary, but regulatory restraint and consistency is equally as important if we are going to allow this industry to reach its full potential.” Ahead of the hearing Senator John Thune, the Republican committee chairman, took a ride in a fully autonomous Continental Chrysler that he declared to be “really amazing” as he stepped out of the car before praising the technology’s potential to prevent traffic accidents. His trip highlighted the mishmash of regional rules that companies dislike as he had to escape tightly regulated Washington DC for the more permissive roads of Virginia before the car could be switched into driverless mode. Although the Republicans who control Congress tend to favour state power over interventions from Washington, Mr Thune told the Financial Times he saw a role for lawmakers and the federal government to play in encouraging driverless cars. “I don’t want to see the feds come down with a heavy hand, but I think [there needs to be] at least a framework where there are general rules of the road. So people developing this technology and doing the research have some parameters to work within.” Glen De Vos of Delphi Automotive, a components supplier, highlighted to lawmakers the trouble caused by inconsistent lane markings between states. “During Delphi’s cross-country drive, the automated vehicle encountered some roadways with wide white stripes, while others had narrow yellow markings. Some lane markings were new, others were faded, and some were marked with raised bumps,” he said. “Delphi will have to further train its cameras to detect all kinds of lane markings, since that’s one way autonomous cars keep themselves centred in a lane.”
7;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2016-01-24T10:38:06Z;Suppliers see silver lining in the Volkswagen scandal;Carmaker may cause backlash against diesel but component makers are gearing up for electric vehicles;Delphi Automotive, Dürr and Murata Manufacturing might not be household names.But they are part of the web of suppliers to a company that in recent months has been regularly hitting the headlines: Volkswagen.Europe’s largest carmaker was rocked by a scandal last September when it admitted installing software-based defeat devices in its diesel vehicles that enabled cheating in official tests for emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides.With VW braced for the affair to cost it billions of euros, and some early signs of a backlash against the German company among car buyers, there have been concerns that its 9,000 suppliers could also be affected.VW this month reported a 2 per cent fall in combined sales by its 12 brands last year — the first annual decline since 2002, with the drop being most severe at the core VW brand. Sales there fell 5 per cent.The poor performance was blamed on the scandal and turmoil in emerging markets, and some analysts say there is a risk the emissions affair could result in a broad consumer backlash against diesel cars made by all automobile manufacturers.But so far, Delphi of the US, Germany’s Dürr and Japan’s Murata Manufacturing — all important suppliers of components to carmakers — say they have not seen any negative effects from the VW scandal.Diesel vehicles dominate the European car market, although before the scandal, VW was trying to improve the technology’s image in the US, as part of efforts to increase its small market share in the country.John Hoffecker, vice-chairman of AlixPartners, the consulting firm, says suppliers that had been gearing up for VW’s big push into diesel in the US were doing so on the basis other carmakers would follow suit because of strict new fuel economy rules that take effect in the country in 2025.“They were assuming [diesel] was going to be one of the core technologies that were going to allow automakers to meet their 2025 testing targets,” he adds.“For those that were selling the parts, those companies are fairly significantly hit, and it was abrupt because VW was the largest [manufacturer of diesel vehicles].”Among US-listed suppliers, one of the few companies to have commented on its exposure to VW’s diesel vehicles is Honeywell, which provides turbochargers.Honeywell said at its third-quarter results in October that it was monitoring the VW emissions affair “very closely”, while stressing that sales to the carmaker amounted to less than 1 per cent of group turnover.One obvious risk for suppliers is that VW, as part of attempts to secure cost savings after the scandal, seeks to cut expenses with third parties providing components.Matthias Müller, VW’s new chief executive, played down this idea in December, saying the company would not “talk to our suppliers, mention the diesel issue and ask them to lower their prices. This is certainly not our style”.Suppliers provide the lion’s share of the electronic and mechanical components found in modern vehicles.Some suppliers that have significant sales with VW stress there are some potential silver linings to the scandal.The prospect of tougher emissions limits for diesel vehicles means carmakers will likely have to add more technology made by their suppliers.Faurecia, a French company that counts VW group as its number one customer, says it expects European emissions regulations to be “significantly tightened”, in a move that would accelerate sales of its products to counter diesel pollutants.The German carmaker is engulfed in the worst scandal in its 78-year history after it admitted to manipulating emissions test data on its diesel vehicles in the US and Europe. The deepening crisis has wiped billions of euros off the company’s shares and rocked the European car industry.All the news and analysisKyocera, a Japanese supplier, in November unveiled a sensor to monitor soot filters in diesel engines — a new product to be released in 2017 to help carmakers meet stricter emissions standards.“If there is a move towards tighter diesel regulations, high-performing components would be required. Kyocera would be well-placed in that case since that’s where our strength is,” says Goro Yamaguchi, president of Kyocera, which makes heat-resistant ceramic packages that protect chips in vehicles.As well as a likely dividend from tougher diesel regulations, some suppliers could also benefit if the VW scandal accelerates carmakers’ shift towards hybrid and electric vehicles.Kevin Clark, chief executive of Delphi, told analysts in October that, even if the VW scandal reduced use of diesel technology, it could still prove advantageous for the company because it typically provided more equipment for hybrid vehicles. “Net net, for us we don’t think it’s a big headwind,” he added.Japanese suppliers are also hoping to benefit from any further shift towards electric vehicles.Murata, the world’s biggest manufacturer of energy-storing ceramic capacitors for smartphones, laptops and cars, suggests the VW scandal could increase the popularity of hybrid and electric vehicles.“The clean image of diesel seems to have collapsed,” says Tsuneo Murata, Murata’s president. “We are not really affected [by the VW scandal], but the ratio of digitalisation is higher for hybrids and EVs so [a shift] could be positive for us.”One car parts supplier that has felt a direct impact from the Volkswagen scandal is Bosch.The privately-held German company, which gets significant business from VW but declines to say how much, has become involved in probes on both sides of the Atlantic.This is because the world’s biggest automotive supplier by sales made crucial parts for some of the 11m VW diesel vehicles affected by the emissions scandal, which began when the carmaker admitted to using software-based defeat devices within engine control mechanisms.Bosch supplied to VW a so-called common-rail injection system, which delivers diesel to the engine cylinders and seeks to offer high performance and quiet running combined with low fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The system includes an engine control unit.Bosch also made urea-dosing modules for the treatment of exhaust gas in some of the cars. Urea is a chemical that can breakdown nitrogen oxides that are emitted by diesel vehicles.However, Bosch has stressed that the way its components are calibrated and integrated into vehicles is “fundamentally the responsibility of each automaker”.Prosecutors in Stuttgart are investigating unidentified Bosch employees to establish whether staff knowingly helped VW in its alleged wrongdoing.A spokesman for the prosecutors said that the investigation was at an early stage and that no individuals had been charged.Bosch, which has about 360,000 employees and annual sales of almost €50bn, said it was “fully co-operating with authorities, assisting them in clarifying the facts concerning the exhaust-gas treatment issue”.It has also said previously it is co-operating with the US Environmental Protection Agency, which wants to know if the company was aware that VW tampered with software in Bosch-supplied equipment. “We are disclosing and delivering the information that has been requested,” added the company.
8;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2015-07-30T14:17:17Z;Delphi buys HellermannTyton for £1.1bn;Car parts maker joins rush to buy industry’s top technology innovators;UK car parts maker Delphi Automotive is to buy British peer HellermannTyton in a £1.1bn deal, part of a series of moves announced by the tech-focused supplier on Thursday.The takeover is the latest in a string of deals among industry suppliers as they seek scale to serve global vehicle manufacturers by snapping up the best future car technology.Delphi, which is headquartered in Gillingham, south-east England, but listed in the US and run from Michigan, said it had agreed to buy HellermannTyton for 480p a share — a 44.5 per cent premium to the closing price the day before — in an all-cash transaction.HellermannTyton, which had a market cap of £715m at Wednesday’s close versus Delphi’s $22.3bn, makes products for protecting, routing and fastening cables. Based in Crawley, southern England, it supplies Volvo, BMW and Delphi as well as companies in the aerospace sector.Delphi is one of the world’s largest parts suppliers and specialises in components and software that seek to make cars safer, better connected and more environmentally efficient.Delphi, once part of General Motors, wants to capitalise on a shift towards greater connectivity in vehicles, as well as the rise of the autonomous car.That was underlined on Thursday, as Delphi also announced the acquisition of Ottomatika, a Pittsburgh-based software company that helped Delphi complete a self-driving coast-to-coast road trip in the US in April.Delphi has also entered into a strategic collaboration with Quanergy of California, which makes 3D lidar sensors — effectively lasers used to power advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous cars and high-definition maps.“Delphi is certainly working on transforming the whole company into the ‘my dream car’ supplier,” said Chris McNally, analyst at Evercore ISI.Not satisfied with three significant announcements, Delphi also flagged a minority investment in Tula Technology, which seeks to use software to increase the fuel efficiency of engines, and said it would divest its automotive antennas business to Northeast Industries, a Chinese supplier.The HellermannTyton deal — the only transaction for which financial details were released — is based on the logic that the era of the connected car calls for more and more electrical architecture in vehicles.Kevin Clark, Delphi chief executive, said: “With consumers now demanding more connectivity in their vehicles, electrical architecture is the enabler to that added vehicle content.”Richard Gane, motor industry specialist at supply chain firm Vendigital, said: “Tier one manufacturers in the sector are eager to strengthen their technology assets by acquiring the best innovators around.”Shares in HellermannTyton — which was taken public by former private equity owner Doughty Hanson in 2013 at 195p — rose 42 per cent to 471.9p.The deal implies an enterprise value for HellermannTyton at about 14.7 times last year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Delphi’s shares, which have risen 16 per cent over the past year, fell 2 per cent in early New York trading.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent.

10;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2015-07-07T15:28:15Z;Smiths Group recruits Reynolds Smith as new chief;FTSE 100 engineering conglomerate under fire over limp revenues in medical and detection divisions;Smiths Group, the FTSE 100 engineering conglomerate, has poached Andrew Reynolds Smith from GKN Automotive, to be its new chief executive after a lengthy hunt for a new boss.Mr Reynolds Smith will join Smiths in September, replacing Philip Bowman, who announced his retirement in December as the group came under fire over limp revenues in its medical and detection divisions.The company has struggled as government spending cuts to defence and healthcare budgets have squeezed its revenue from state contracts, which account for about 30 per cent of income.Mr Reynolds Smith, 49, has run GKN’s autos division — its largest — since 2002, and previously occupied senior management positions at Irish industrial group Ingersoll-Rand, UK industrial conglomerate Siebe, now Invensys, and Delphi Automotive Systems.“I am absolutely delighted that we have attracted someone of Andrew’s calibre as our new chief executive,” said Smiths’ chairman, Sir George Buckley.“His career has equipped him to grow businesses through innovation and technical excellence as well as through targeted M&A.”Investors seemed to greet the appointment with less enthusiasm, and Smiths’ share price fell 4.1 per cent to £10.97 on Tuesday. Smiths’ shares have lost 9.3 per cent in the past month and 28 per cent since the start of 2014.Mr Reynolds Smith faces a significant challenge in transforming the fortunes of the stumbling conglomerate. In its most recent trading update in May, the company said full-year revenues will “decline modestly” this year as it faces “challenging trading conditions across many markets”.Investors do not want a nuts and bolts man at Smiths. They want a dismantler: someone capable of splitting a sluggish business up and selling the bits, says Jonathan Guthrie.Continue reading“I’m very pleased and have a great feeling about this appointment,” said Mr Reynolds Smith. “Smiths is a very special company with high-quality global businesses and an enviable heritage of quality engineering and innovation.”Mr Bowman took over Smiths Group in 2007, spurring expectations that he would break up and streamline the sprawling conglomerate. However, a big UK pension deficit and asbestos liabilities scuppered these plans, and in an FT interview last July Mr Bowman expressed frustration that he had been unable to put the plans into action.Smiths executives were lambasted at the group’s annual meeting last November after full-year earnings undershot expectations.Smiths started out as a watchmaker in 1851, but is now the world’s largest manufacturer of sensors for the detection of explosives, drugs, weapons and chemical agents.
11;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2015-02-12T14:42:38Z;Carmakers seek to use carbon fibre in mass-market vehicles;Material that is as strong as steel but half the weight boosts vehicles’ fuel efficiency;With its aggressive looks, the 170mph Cadillac ATS-VR racing car stood out from the crowd at last month’s Detroit auto show — not least because of the long wing stretching across the vehicle’s rear.This wing is made from carbon fibre: a strong and light material that is also very expensive, meaning that its use has so far been confined to high-end, low-volume vehicles. Yet there were signs at Detroit of a change in the motor industry’s attitude to the esoteric material, with US manufacturers led by General Motors and Ford seeking to turn carbon fibre into a building block for mass-market cars.This is because the material could underpin a step change in vehicles’ fuel efficiency by making them much lighter — carbon fibre is as strong as steel but half the weight or less. Jeff Owens, chief technology officer for Delphi Automotive, a car-component supplier, says that carbon fibre has always been “a bit of a Holy Grail” for the industry. “It’s extremely strong and very light,” he adds.But the carmakers face significant challenges in turning carbon fibre into a material for mass-market cars — notably whether they can come up with an efficient manufacturing process to produce carbon-fibre components in large volumes.Ford announced in Detroit that it was starting a joint research effort with DowAksa — a joint venture involving Dow Chemical of the US and Turkey’s Aksa — on automotive-grade carbon fibre. GM, Cadillac’s parent, has been engaged for more than three years in a research programme with Japan’s Teijin that is similar to Ford’s effort.The push to develop carbon fibre in the motor industry is only the latest in a series of changes stemming from US rules requiring carmakers to improve their vehicles’ average fuel efficiency from 27.5 miles per gallon in 2012 to 54.5 mpg by 2025.The question for carmakers is whether there will ever be a breakthrough moment for carbon-fibre equivalent to the introduction last year of aluminium body panels on Ford’s F150 pickup truck, North America’s best-selling vehicle. This marked the first use of aluminium in a truly mass-market vehicle, and the switch away from steel reduced the F150’s weight by 13 per cent compared with its predecessor model.54.5 mpgThe efficiency target for 2025 that the US requires carmakers to achieveGM, like other carmakers and component suppliers, says that it is hard to predict whether there will be a breakthrough soon for carbon fibre.“Maybe it results in a new [manufacturing] process in a short period of time — maybe not,” adds the company.Manufacturing components from carbon fibre tends to be labour intensive, slow, and ill-suited to the ways in which car factories operate. This is because parts are made by sealing carbon threads with resin and baking the mixture hard, and components typically emerge in large batches rather than in a steady stream.GM’s research is exploring the potential for mixes of carbon fibre and plastics to make the manufacturing process simpler.Jim deVries, head of materials and manufacturing research at Ford, focuses on the time it takes to produce carbon-fibre components as the biggest problem. “You see carbon fibre used in a lot of luxury vehicles, lower volume vehicles,” he says. “The challenge and the focus of [our] programme is to bring it from niche and lower-volume to high-volume products.”There was one early sign at Detroit that carbon fibre might be close to making it into the mass market. Johnson Controls, the automotive supplier, was exhibiting its prototype Camisma seat with a carbon-fibre frame that is 40 per lighter than metal equivalents.Andreas Eppinger, head of technology for Johnson Controls’ seating division, says that the seat design has resolved many of the problems with which others in the industry are wrestling.The company has simplified the manufacturing process and developed robots to produce the carbon fibre, meaning it should be possible to make 200,000 seats each year on a single production line. However, such production methods are likely to remain more expensive than existing techniques for the foreseeable future.But Mr Owens points out that carmakers face ever-greater costs in the main alternative means of improving fuel economy — boosting engine efficiency.“As [other means] to meet some of the fuel-economy and emissions regulations become more and more expensive, some of the alternatives start to look better and better,” he says, in a nod towards carbon fibre.
12;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2011-11-20T18:04:28Z;Delphi says acquisitions ‘on our radar’;;Delphi Automotive, the US car parts maker that went public last week after a long post-bankruptcy restructuring, is seeking acquisitions to boost its Asia-Pacific presence and expand its core businesses.Rodney O’Neal, chief executive, who also sounded a bullish note on the eurozone, told the Financial Times that the powertrain, electrical and electronics sectors were priority targets.“We don’t need acquisitions to execute what is a very attractive business model,” Mr O’Neal said. Nonetheless, he added, “that is on our radar” as a way of accelerating Delphi’s business plan, centred on what the company describes as “safe, green and connected” products.On the European automotive market, Mr O’Neal said that fourth-quarter production schedules “look very strong”, painting a brighter picture of the market than several of Delphi’s rivals and customers. . For 2012, “we still haven’t really had a chance to digest what’s going to occur, but I remain very optimistic”, he said.General Motors, PSA Peugeot Citroën and Magna International are among those that have warned in recent weeks of tough conditions in Europe.But Mr O’Neal said that German luxury carmakers, which are Delphi’s biggest customers, “are not downbeat at all. They’re very upbeat.” He added that Delphi was helped by its diverse customer base, including parts for heavy-duty truck makers and the after-market sector.Europe now contributes 43 per cent of Delphi’s revenues, up from 25 per cent at the time of its bankruptcy filing in 2005.Despite car production and sales rebounding strongly, there is little celebration. Car companies are unlikely to recover their pre-crisis output levels for many years, in what experts are calling ‘the new normal’ for the industryDelphi shares have traded below their $22 issue price since last Thursday’s IPO. They fell 1.6 per cent on Friday to $21. Mr O’Neal blamed the trend in the overall market. The main seller of shares in the $530m IPO was John Paulson’s hedge fund, one of several that invested in Delphi as part of its court-supervised restructuring.Delphi was spun off by GM in 1999 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2005. Its four-year restructuring was one of the longest and most complex in US industrial history.“It’s been an epic journey for us”, Mr Neal said. Now, he added, “we do have the right products, the right customers. We’re in the right regions. We have the right cost structure.”According to Mr O’Neal, Delphi has lowered its dependence on GM from more than half of total sales to about a fifth.Its exposure to North America has shrunk from 68 per cent of sales to 33 per cent.Net income climbed to $855m in the first nine months of this year, up more than 50 per cent from the same period of 2010.
13;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Investors give US listings mixed reception;Busiest week in months confronts market caution;The busiest week in several months for US equity issuance is getting a mixed reception from investors as market conditions remain choppy.A $114m initial public offering of Angie’s List, an online reviews site for consumer services, priced at the top of its range on Wednesday, and on Thursday its shares rose 25 per cent to $16.26.LinkedIn, the social network that went public earlier this year, returned to the market on Wednesday to raise an additional $568m. The shares, sold mostly by venture capital owners of LinkedIn, such as Bain Capital, then jumped 4.7 per cent in trading on Thursday.But Delphi Automotive, the once-bankrupt vehicle components supplier that ran a $530m IPO, fell 3 per cent in first-day trading to $21.33. John Paulson’s hedge fund, which had bought into Delphi during its bankruptcy, was the primary seller of shares.Also on Thursday, Yelp, a website for restaurant and other consumer reviews, filed to go public, seeking to raise around $100m. It will not price for several months, as US regulators must first examine the filing.The IPO market is showing signs of life after being mostly shut since July amid a surge in market volatility. But conditions are still difficult, and many companies are holding off or scaling back their plans.With at least seven IPOs expected to price by the end of the week – potentially the busiest week since May – and several more hoping to debut by the year-end, underwriters are fiercely vying for investors’ attention.At least 140 companies are still in the US IPO pipeline, according to Dealogic, the most in several years.“This is a window-driven market. There will be a big fight to get investors’ attention with the number of roadshows being scheduled,” said Mark Connelly, global head of equity capital markets at Jefferies. “The stress on the system will create some discounts.”Although the two tech IPOs outperformed industrial Delphi, investors are still discriminating between tech companies. Bluestem Brands, an ecommerce group, and Lashou, a Chinese online coupon seller, postponed planned offerings this week.“Tech names are the ones getting the attention, but only the ones with a deep speciality that long-term investors want to own,” said Josef Schuster, president of IPOX Schuster, an investment adviser.Earlier this month Groupon, the online coupon seller, went public despite investor concerns about the company’s business model. But the shares were priced at half the value initially sought, and the roadshow was accelerated by skipping a trip to London.Meanwhile, groups such as Zynga, a designer of games for Facebook, and Silver Spring Networks, an electrical grid software developer, are still waiting to set dates for planned offerings.Caesars Entertainment, the private-equity backed casino group, this week said it would resume an IPO postponed last year. Its new filing was for a sale of $50m, versus an earlier plan to raise $500m.
14;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2011-11-17T15:34:21Z;Delphi shares drop in first-day trading;;Shares of Delphi Automotive dropped in first-day trading after its initial public offering, highlighting the difficulty the car components-maker has faced in returning to the public markets.The $530m IPO was priced at $22 on Wednesday night, at the low end of its $22-$24 range. The main seller of shares was John Paulson’s hedge fund, which had taken a stake in the company during its bankruptcy.On Thursday morning, its shares opened at $21.25, an unusually sharp drop of 3.4 per cent. They rebounded somewhat to $21.89 in the first hour of trading.The average US IPO has risen 11.5 per cent in first-day trading this year, according to Ipreo, a capital markets data and advisory firm.Paulson & Co was one of several hedge funds that acquired large stakes in the one-time General Motors subsidiary after it filed for bankruptcy in 2005. But it is the only one that braved difficult market conditions to sell shares on Wednesday.It was one of a number of deals pricing on Wednesday night. Angie’s List, a website for reviews of consumer services, raised $114m after selling shares at the top of its price range. LinkedIn also sold 8m shares in a secondary offering, raising $568m, with the bulk of the shares sold by investors, including Bain Capital.In Delphi’s 24.1m share offering, Mr Paulson sold 20.5m shares, with several smaller investors also selling. Delphi itself sold no shares. The stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.Delphi faced investor concerns about the company’s substantial exposure to the struggling European economy, as well as the poor performance of other automotive stocks, including GM, whose shares are down 32 per cent since its own IPO a year ago.“With the extremely turbulent markets and serious economic woes in Europe, this may not be a timely buy,” said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique, an investor advisory.Paulson & Co has come under scrutiny this year for a series of bad bets on financial stocks, such as Citigroup and Bank of America. It is facing redemption requests, but Mr Paulson has told investors that the fund has ample liquidity to meet them. Paulson & Co declined to comment.Paulson will still have a 15.8 per cent share in Delphi after the sale, but the 3.6m shares set aside to be sold later by the underwriters will also come from shares owned by Paulson.The other hedge funds that own big stakes in Delphi, Elliot Associates, Silver Point Capital and Oaktree Capital, sold no shares on Wednesday. They will collectively own 29.4 per cent of the company after the IPO.The offering is a key step in the dramatic transformation of Delphi, which was spun off by GM in 1999 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2005. Its four-year restructuring was one of the longest and most complex in US industrial history.The company has lowered its dependence on GM from more than half of sales to about one-fifth, and its exposure to North America has shrunk from 68 per cent of sales to 33 per cent. Conversely, its emerging markets business has grown from 7 per cent to a quarter of total sales.It also brought down costs by closing or selling the bulk of its North American plants. It now employs only 5,000 people in the US, or less than 4 per cent of its total workforce, down from 46,000 before the bankruptcy filing. All Delphi’s unionised workers in the US have returned to GM.Delphi’s net income climbed to $855m in the first nine months of this year, up more than 50 per cent from the same period of 2010.
15;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2011-05-26T00:31:11Z;Delphi files for IPO;;Two years after emerging from a long and difficult bankruptcy battle, Delphi Automotive has filed to raise $100m in an initial public offering.The auto-parts group, spun off from General Motors in 1999, was among the first victims of the slow-motion collapse of the US auto industry, entering bankruptcy in 2005 and not exiting Chapter 11 until 2009.According to the prospectus, Delphi made a net profit of $291m on revenues of $3.9bn in the first quarter of 2011, an increase in earnings of 35 per cent from the same quarter last year. Overall in 2010, it earned $631m on sales of $13.8bn.Delphi produces parts directly for auto manufacturers, and sells little to the retail market. The bulk of its sales are electronic equipment. It carries little long-term debt, just $178m, and has $1.6bn of cash and cash equivalents.Since its bankruptcy it has weaned itself of its reliance on GM, serving 25 of the largest vehicle manufacturers, according to the prospectus. In March, Delphi paid $3.8bn to buy out GM’s remaining ownership in the company. GM had contributed some $12.5bn to keep it afloat during its bankruptcy.Delphi’s global workforce has shrunk from 180,000 to 100,000 since 2005, with most of the cuts in the US. About 15,000 salaried pensioners in the US were forced to give up healthcare benefits and a large chunk of their pensions.Now, it operates 110 facilities and 14 research centres across 30 countries, with a particular focus on growing in China, it said. Emerging markets are projected growing at a rate of 10.3 per cent annually to 2015, versus 3.3 per cent for developed markets.The largest individual shareholders in the company are an all-star group of distressed-investment hedge funds, which includes Paulson & Co, Elliott Associates, Silver Point Capital and Oak Tree Capital. Each of the funds holds at least 5 per cent of the company.The offering will be led by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.US auto groups have seen their share prices rise sharply since the depths of the crisis, with the S&P automotive and components index up 44 per cent since the beginning of last year. General Motors went public last year in the US’ largest ever IPO, more than $20bn, but its shares have since fallen below their initial price.
16;APTV;Aptiv Plc;2011-03-31T23:55:52Z;Delphi buys back $4.4bn in shares;;Delphi Automotive, the US car parts maker which emerged from bankruptcy last year, has redeemed equity stakes worth $4.4bn held by General Motors and the US government’s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.The carmaker and the pension-guarantee agency acquired the shares to support Delphi’s emergence from Chapter 11 last October under the control of a group of private-equity investors. GM will receive $3.8bn and the PBGC almost $600m.Michigan-based Delphi was spun off from GM in 1999 and remains one of the carmaker’s biggest suppliers. But GM was forced to provide almost $16bn in financial support – ranging from the equity infusion to worker buy-outs and pension subsidies – during the five years that Delphi spent in Chapter 11, in one of the country’s longest and most complex bankruptcy restructurings.GM said that the retirement of its equity stake would help restore a more normal customer-supplier relationship. The carmaker valued the Delphi stake at $1.7bn at the time of the parts maker’s emergence from Chapter 11 and at $2bn at the end of 2010. It said it would record a book gain of $1.6bn in its first-quarter results from the sale.PBGC has paid benefits to about 70,000 Delphi workers and retirees since 2009. It took over $6.1bn of underfunded liabilities in the Delphi pension plan, the second-biggest loss absorbed in the agency’s 36-year history.It said that it did not yet know how the redemption of the Delphi equity stake would affect retirees’ benefits.Delphi has funded the redemptions from cash reserves and $2.5bn in new bank loans from JPMorgan.The parts maker said that its debt level remained “prudent”. Now a private company, it reported 2010 pre-tax earnings of $1.4bn on revenues of $13.8bn.Dan Ammann, GM’s incoming chief financial officer, said that “we are systematically delivering on our commitment to strengthen and simplify our balance sheet”. GM recently raised $1bn from the sale of its preferred shares in Ally Financial, which previously as GMAC was GM’s vehicle financing unit.
