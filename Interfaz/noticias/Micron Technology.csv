0;MU;Micron Technology;2017-03-23T20:35:27Z;Rising sales jolt Micron shares higher;;Semiconductor maker Micron Technologies saw its shares soar in after-market trading on Thursday after it announced its latest quarterly revenues were 58 per cent higher than the same time a year ago.Micron chief executive Mark Durcan credited the results from the second quarter of its fiscal 2017 to “strong demand and limited industry supply” for its DRAM and NAND memory chips, as well as ongoing cost-cutting efforts. Since the first quarter of the fiscal year, DRAM average selling prices have jumped 21 per cent, while trade NAND sales volumes have risen 18 per cent, the company said.Revenue for the three-month period ending March 2 were $4.65bn, in line with what analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected. Net income attributable to Micron shareholders was $894m, or 77 cents per diluted share, versus the $887.8m profit and 78 cent-per share earnings analysts expected. It is also a marked improvement over the same three-month period last year, when Micron chalked up a net loss of $97m, or 9 cents a share.Falling manufacturing costs also helped it bring its gross margin up by 11.2 percentage points to 36.7 per cent, compared to the first quarter of FY 2017Over the past 12 months, Micron shares have zoomed 148.5 per cent higher. After its earnings release, investors sent the company’s stock up nearly 8 per cent in after-hours trading.
1;MU;Micron Technology;2012-03-21T21:29:49Z;US stocks edge down;;US equities fell for a second straight day as new housing data showed that existing home sales slipped in February, even as homebuilders continued to strengthen their first-quarter gains.The S&P 500, which had opened the morning session positively, finished Wednesday’s session down 0.2 per cent to 1,402.89. The benchmark US index lost further ground from its highest close since May 2008 achieved on Monday.Economists expressed concerns about the housing market recovery with the latest data showing existing home sales fell by 0.9 per cent to 4.59m, just below analysts’ expectations .“As with the report for new home sales earlier in the week, the report for existing home sales, which makes up 93.5 per cent of the overall market, held close to the strongest level since May 2010,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economist at Miller Tabak.“However, the level of activity fails to change our view that any recovery is shallow, rising from a low base with conventional monetary policy failing to overcome the significant restraints hampering the housing market.”But the news did not damp momentum on the S&P 500 homebuilders index, which climbed 0.8 per cent on the day and has gained 34 per cent in the year to date.PulteGroup, one of three homebuilders measured by the index, led its rivals and rose 2 per cent to $9.39.Watson Pharmaceuticals, the maker of generic and brand name drugs, was the leading gainer on the main market.A Reuters report said the company was in talks to buy Actavis Group, a Switzerland-based generic drugmaker, for up to €5.5bn. Shares in Watson gained 8.8 per cent to $63.69.Hartford Financial Services was one of the day’s best performing stocks before settling, as it updated first-quarter projected earnings above analysts’ expectations. Shares in the insurance company rose as much as 7.3 per cent, but finished up just 1.2 per cent to $22.02.The S&P 500 financial service index led all major sectors in the morning session before falling 0.4 per cent to be second worst on the day, ahead of the energy index, which was down 1 per cent.Bank of America was near the top of bank stocks and was flirting with the $10 threshold for much of Wednesday. Shares in the bank climbed 0.1 per cent to $9.82. Morgan Stanley was the worst of the major banks, down 1.7 per cent to $20.06.Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, was the biggest loser among the energy stocks and fell 5.8 per cent to $45.04 as it warned first-quarter profits would disappoint.The Nasdaq Composite Index was the only major index on the positive side, rising fractionally to 3,075.32.LinkedIn, the online professional networking site, was among the top gainers on the technology-heavy index.Shares in the company 6.5 per cent to $97.89 after receiving an upgrade from “hold” to “buy” by analysts at Goldman Sachs.“Our checks show increasing traction for LinkedIn’s hiring solutions and improving user engagement that, along with emerging products, suggest a steeper slope to the company’s long-term growth,” Goldman Sachs said in a note.“On a more macro level, we believe LinkedIn is one of the companies best positioned to benefit from growth in mobile usage, given its reliance on subscriptions over advertising.”Oracle, the software company, fell 2.3 per cent to $29.41 despite giving the tech sector a boost as it reported a “very solid” third-quarter in the three months to February 29.Analyst reactions to the company’s results were mixed, however.“The fact is that Oracle is not growing particularly rapidly and, despite an extended discussion to the contrary, the firm is facing a tougher group of competitors,” said Richard David, tech analyst at Canaccord. He reiterated his “hold” rating.Meanwhile, Citigroup analysts described the software company as “back on track” and maintained their “buy” rating on its shares.Micron Technologies, the semiconductor manufacturer, gained 2 per cent to $8.74 as reports said the company had made a $1.5bn bid to acquire Elpida Memory, a Japanese chipmaker.Netflix, the online and home delivery video provider, rose 4.4 per cent to $120.10 as it revealed plans to stream a new original series on its site, beginning in 2013.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,124.62. Hewlett-Packard, the computer and printer maker, was the biggest loser on the blue-chip heavy index.Shares in the company, which said it would combine its PC and printer divisions, fell by 2.2 per cent to $23.46.Walt Disney, the entertainment group that said on Tuesday that it would suffer a $200m loss on its latest film John Carter, rose 0.1 per cent to $43.27.Analysts at Nomura added its shares to their conviction buy list, saying: “We believe the focus will now shift to Disney’s core assets, which we believe are poised for above-peer growth.”
2;MU;Micron Technology;2011-03-10T21:43:33Z;Tech stocks drag down Wall St;;A pull-back in technology shares matched a broad decline in US stocks as confidence in the economy was hit by troubling data.The Nasdaq Composite index, weighted towards tech groups, dropped 1.8 per cent to 2,701.02, below its 50-day moving average, a key technical marker.Especially troubling was a report from China that Hewlett-Packard, the personal computer maker, was considering spinning off its PC business.HP said the unit was not for sale, and many analysts discounted the likelihood of such a move.But HP shares were off 1.4 per cent to $41.48, their lowest level of the year. Rival Dell was off 1.2 per cent to $15.24.The moves followed a report from analysts at JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday that supply of “tablet” PCs, like Apple’s iPad and Motorola’s Xoom, could outstrip demand by 36 per cent. Shares in Apple were off 1.7 per cent to $346.67.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2.5 per cent, adding to its 3 per cent drop on Wednesday, to below its own 50-day moving average.“Semiconductors are the best indicator, because they go into everything, from toasters to aeroplanes,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US equity trading at Canaccord Adams. “The shares always top out first and bottom out first.”Micron Technologies fell 3.8 per cent to $9.93 a share and NXP Semiconductor was down 4.6 per cent to $26.51 a share.NetApp, a provider of data storage, fell 6.1 per cent to $48.41 after it sold its external data storage unit to LSI, a rival. LSI rose 3.1 per cent to $6.32.The broader S&P 500 index was 1.9 per cent lower at the close, at 1,295.11. The Dow Jones Industrial average was also off 1.9 per cent to 11,984.61. Both were, like the Nasdaq index, below their 50-day moving averages.A negative jobless claims report was received as evidence emerged that rising oil prices were a threat to the economic recovery. The US labour department reported that 397,000 people filed unemployment claims last week, against a consensus forecast of 378,000.Trade data were also troubling. China reported a $7.3bn deficit as its exports, a key measure of global economic activity, declined. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit, widened to its highest level in five months in January. “To the extent that this surge reflects the strength of domestic demand . . . it isn’t necessarily a disaster,” said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics.“Nevertheless, it is a concern, particularly when we know that the latest surge in the cost of imported oil will drive the deficit above $50bn over the next few months.”Energy shares pulled back as US oil prices fell, though they remained above $100 a barrel.The S&P 500 sector fell 3.6 per cent, its worst one-day decline since last June. Chevron, the oil group, fell 3 per cent to $99.08, and rival ExxonMobil fell 3.6 per cent to $81.38.Materials and industrials groups were also hit hard. Caterpillar, the producer of industrial equipment, fell 3.9 per cent to $98.39 a share. Alcoa, the aluminium group, lost 3.1 per cent to $15.80.Shares in General Motors, the US carmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to $31.42 after it said that Chris Liddell, chief financial officer, was leaving the company.“Now [GM has] talented people in all the right spots but they don’t seem to want to hang around,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. He said it was reassuring when Dan Ammann, the incoming CFO, said he planned to stay indefinitely.HCA, the hospital group that went public in a $3.8bn deal on Wednesday night, opened at $31.02, a 3.4 per cent rise from its issuing price of $30 a share.Starbucks, the coffee and beverage retailer, was the top gainer in the S&P 500, hitting an all-time high.Shares were up 9.9 per cent to $37.97 after it made a deal with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, makers of the Keurig single-cup serving system, to allow it to use Starbucks brands. Shares in Green Mountain soared 41 per cent to $61.71 a share following the deal, a record high.Iron Mountain, which handles data storage for companies, saw its shares jump 5.2 per cent to $27.66 after Elliott Management, a hedge fund, nominated four members to the board.Elliott has argued that Iron Mountain could unlock value if it spun off its warehouses used for storing documents into a separate property company.
3;MU;Micron Technology;2006-07-21T19:01:00Z;Infineon plans $1.1bn Qimonda offering;;German chipmaker Infineon plans to raise $1.1bn by floating up to 21 per cent of Qimonda, its memory chip unit, on the New York Stock Exchange by mid-August, making it NYSE’s largest foreign issue since 2004.Investors are likely to watch the public offer closely as foreign companies have avoided US listings because of stricter corporate reporting standards – and because market turbulence has left its mark on tech-stock prices.The move marks Infineon’s withdrawal from the cyclical market for D-Ram microchips. It wants to focus on higher-margin logic chips, found in cars or telephones, and will invest some of the IPO takings in this area.However, the group’s third-quarter figures showed it is still having problems turning in steady profits in its communications and car divisions, while Qimonda made money thanks to a further recovery in memory-chip prices.In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Infineon said it planned to sell up to 63m shares in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at between $16 and $18 each, mainly to institutional investors. The Munich-based company had long mulled a listing in Asia, but plumped for New York in May hoping that NYSE-listed rival Micron Technologies would give investors a useful measure. Since then, that stock has lost 15 per cent.Peter Fischl, Infineon chief financial officer, said the price-building range was, nonetheless, “fair”. Credit Suisse, Citigroup and JP Morgan are bookrunners, with ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank and HVB co-lead managers.Should the banks manage to sell all allocated shares, Infineon’s stake would shrink to 79 per cent. Wolfgang Ziebart, chief executive, said Infineon would in time give up its majority stake, but refused to specify a timeframe.Qimonda stands to pocket up to $756m from the offer, although it will have to pay the banks’ fees and repay its parent company a loan of $570m.The balance is to be invested in research and manufacturing facilities. Infineon plans to pump its takings, which could fall just shy of $350m, into its two remaining divisions.Together they reported a loss before interest and taxes of €4m ($5.1m) after a loss of €85m a year ago. Sales dipped 4 per cent to €980m.
4;MU;Micron Technology;2006-05-11T19:26:05Z;European Comment: Looking west for listings;;"European companies have been shying away from listing in New York, put
off by added governance requirements and extra paperwork demanded by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.If anything, the traffic has been in the other direction. Earlier this week, Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, followed through on its earlier decision to de-list from the New York Stock Exchange by calling on US shareholders to sell their stock, allowing it to de-register altogether.Undaunted, Infineon, the German semiconductor group, wants to sell shares in its memory-chip unit, Qimonda, on the NYSE this autumn in what looks set to be the biggest European listing there for years.The decision – described by people close to the company as a “difficult” one – shows that there
are still occasions when
the sheer size and sophistication of the US market offsets the red tape.Infineon and its bankers looked at and quickly dismissed a listing in Europe. Memory chips were too exotic for the region. Chip-loving markets in Japan and Taiwan were in the running.But in the end the prize went to New York because of US institutions’ familiarity with the cyclical business and with big US competitors such as Micron Technologies.The German group will join a scattering of Asian technology groups, such as LG Philips LCD, that believe Sarbanes-Oxley is a small price to pay for access to a liquid, well-informed market.Of course, a bid for the London Stock Exchange would give the NYSE rather more direct access to European issuers. Still, it must be reassuring for US exchange executives to know that some Europeans still want to make the transatlantic journey.There are growing signs that Aim, the LSE's junior market, is starting to appear on the radar screens of corporate Germany.Last September, SQS Software Quality Systems became the first German company to have a primary listing on Aim. Half its investors are based in Germany and this week the company came of age with its first acquisition since flotation, paying up to £18m (€26m) for Cresta Group. Inova Holding, a Bavarian IT company, is joining Aim next week. The company had attracted merger offers from UK companies already listed there, so it was an easy decision to join Aim to raise funds. The company has raised a total of £10m, £4m from eight or nine German institutions.Further evidence of continental appetite for Aim stocks comes from Adept Telecom, the UK fixed-line reseller. It spent a day making presentations in Frankfurt at the suggestion of its analyst – an employee of Kepler, which covers more than 500 companies across continental Europe. As a result, 25 per cent of the £8m raised by Adept came from German institutions.Kepler is a sister company of Adept’s adviser, the UK broker Teather & Greenwood. Now Teather is keen to capitalise further on the European resource at its finger-tips. It can only be a matter of time before Kepler analysts start to suggest suitable candidates for London listing. If they really want to create a sensation, they should try to net the first Aim company from France.The markets in financial instruments directive (Mifid) aims to increase cross-border competition in the European Union’s financial services sector. Like the investment services directive before it, harmonisation is at its heart. But to listen to bank executives responsible for adapting their institutions to the new rules before November 2007, you would think that Mifid had been framed just to make life more complicated.True, Mifid was born of a certain amount of political compromise. Yes, the exact detail of how Mifid should be implemented is not yet clear – and may not be until early next year, if then. Institutions that operate in several EU markets are also worried about the possibility of having to answer to differing interpretations of Mifid by individual national regulators. These are uncertainties that particularly worry small and medium-sized EU firms.But evidence continues to mount that the largest financial services groups will profit from the measure. Once the directive is in place, for instance, there will be little to stop a large bank mounting a direct challenge to an established European stock exchange. Even quite big institutions may decide to offload the technical and administrative burden of running an equity markets business by outsourcing it to one of the giants.Of course, this transition is likely to be messy, but then nobody said revolutions were neat and tidy."
5;MU;Micron Technology;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Hynix told to pay damages to Rambus;;A long-running legal saga that has turned into one of the computing industry?s most controversial intellectual property disputes reached a potential turning point on Monday when a US jury ordered Hynix of South Korea to pay California-based Rambus damages of $307m.The jury award sent shares of Rambus up by more than 13 per cent as Wall Street looked forward to the prospects of a broader victory in the company?s campaign to extract damages and future royalties from some of the world?s biggest makers of memory chips.Hynix shares dropped 2.7 per cent to Won33,000 by early Tuesday, while its larger rival Samsung, which is also sued by Rambus, also fell 2.7 per cent to Won655,000.A lawyer for Hynix said after the ruling that the South Korean company would continue to push a separate claim that the patents on which Rambus based its case were anti-competitive, and so should be ruled unenforceable.Rambus rose to become one of the chip industry?s hottest stocks in the late 1990s on hopes for its technology, which speeds the rate at which DRAM memory chips can retrieve data. However, the big manufacturers that dominate the industry balked at paying its high royalty rates, eventually devising a different technology between them to achieve the same ends.The Californian company filed patent infringement claims against Hynix, Infineon and Micron Technologies, and last year added Samsung to the list after the world?s biggest maker of memory chips failed to agree terms to renew an existing royalty agreement.Infineon last year settled its case with Rambus, agreeing at the time to license the company?s technology and pay up to $100m if the other companies resolved their disputes. Rambus also filed private antitrust claims against the manufacturers.The small chip company has drawn fire, however, over the way it patented some of its ideas, as well as its handling of the legal cases.The chipmakers accused it of acting unfairly to embed its ideas in industry-standard technology, then later trying to claim royalties ? an accusation that prompted an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.The company?s handling of the case has made it one of the most prominent targets of critics who claim that abuse of the US patent system exposes tech companies to unfair claims, said Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University.Last year a judge rejected Rambus? cases against Infineon after ruling that the company destroyed documents and created false records to help its case, but Hynix failed to press a similar claim in its own defence.
6;MU;Micron Technology;2005-06-15T21:43:37Z;Rambus files antitrust case against Samsung;;Rambus, the memory chip designer, on Wednesday broadened its existing antitrust lawsuit against Dram (Dynamic Random Access Memory) makers, adding Samsung, the biggest maker of such semiconductors, to its list of targets.Hynix Semiconductor and Micron Technologies have already been accused by Rambus of antitrust violations. The company is arguing that the defendants had been trying to exclude it from the memory market.Last week, Rambus filed patent infringement cases against Samsung and the South Korean company responded by counter-filing to seek an invalidation of four Rambus patents.The legal action follows a failure to agree terms of a new licensing contract between Samsung and Rambus, with an existing one due to expire at the end of this month.
7;MU;Micron Technology;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
