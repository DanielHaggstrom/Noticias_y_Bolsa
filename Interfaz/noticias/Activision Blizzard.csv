0;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2019-10-10T17:02:40Z;Games become hearthstone for HK protests;Deepfakes and a fresher Prince, Dyson cancels electric car, iPhone fine, Holoride;"FT subscribers can click here to receive tech news daily by email in the #techFT newsletterOnline gaming's avatars and virtual worlds have provided relative anonymity to Chinese users looking to show sympathy with Hong Kong's protesters but fearing repercussions.That has not been the case for professional video game player Ng Wai “Blitzchung” Chung though, a Grandmaster player of Hearthstone who donned a gas mask and shouted “Liberate Hong Kong”, in a livestreamed post-match interview on Sunday.Repercussions came swiftly from the game's US publisher Activision Blizzard, which banned him for a year from esports and removed his Grandmaster status. The move echoed that of the National Basketball Association, which said it was “extremely disappointed by the inappropriate comment” in a tweet last Friday by the general manager of the Houston Rockets, which said: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong”.Both Activision and the NBA are heavily invested in the Chinese market and are therefore sensitive to upsetting the authorities there. Analysts at Cowen and Company estimate 10 per cent of Activision Blizzard's revenue comes from China and a higher percentage of profits.But the publisher is now suffering a huge backlash and boycott from gamers, and perhaps from its own employees, over its action. Online forums are urging users to delete their accounts, while plaques at Blizzard's headquarters saying “Think Globally” and “Every Voice Matters” have been covered up. Further protests seem likely at the BlizzCon convention for gamers at the end of the month.Meanwhile, Mei, a hero in another Blizzard game Overwatch, is being adopted as a symbol for the protests and as a swipe at Blizzard, as it endures another form of wrath to that playing out on the streets of Hong Kong.1. Apple has a China problem too
Apple has removed a mapping app used by Hong Kong protesters from its App Store, soon after it was criticised by Chinese state media for allowing it to be downloaded. It has also removed the mobile app of news organisation Quartz in mainland China, a move that Quartz alleged was a result of its coverage of the protests. Apple said in a statement on Thursday that HKmap.live, which shows the crowdsourced real-time locations of traffic obstructions, police and protesters, “has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong”.2. Deepfakes create a fresher Prince
The latest Will Smith movie, Gemini Man, released in the US and UK on Friday, features the actor as his 51-year-old self, alongside a 23-year-old version that puts him back in his Fresh Prince of Bel Air days in terms of looks. Tim Bradshaw's Big Page explains how this Hollywood version of deepfakes makes him a completely digital recreation that probably cost tens of millions of dollars to make. But the price for a fully digital human is plummeting, prompting some in Silicon Valley to wonder when virtual assistants, such as Alexa, will no longer be just a disembodied voice.3. Dyson cancels electric car project
Vacuum cleaner maker Dyson is having to suck it up over its foiled plans to build an electric car. It will wind down its electric vehicle project, ending a venture that founder James Dyson claimed would redefine his business. The company failed to find a buyer for its designs, and said that its plans to build a car from scratch in Singapore were no longer commercially viable.4. Nobel Prizes and Brexit jeopardy
In a week that two scientists working at UK institutions were awarded Nobel Prizes — Peter Ratcliffe at the Francis Crick Institute (Physiology or Medicine), and Didier Queloz at Cambridge university (Physics) — two prior laureates, including the director of the Crick, complained that Brexit was already damaging British science. The UK’s involvement with the European Research Council, and with other pan-European organisations such as Euratom, is due to end when the UK leaves the EU.5. How my iPhone landed me with a £476 fine
Alphaville reporter Jemima Kelly's account of how trying to pay for a £1.50 bus ticket with Apple Pay turned into a huge fine is one of our most-read stories today. The lesson she learnt: invest in a portable phone charger.Berlin-based scooter start-up Tier Mobility announced a $60m funding round this week as the battle for the European scooter market hots up. Tier has been expanding fast in Europe, especially in Germany, where scooters were legalised this summer, and is in tough competition with the likes of Wind, Voi and Circ. There are also big US competitors. The Tier fundraising follows a raise by US-based Bird of no less than $275m the week before, with expectations that it will continue its expansion into Europe (Bird is already in 23 cities, from Poznan to Paris, and over 50 cities in the US.)Elsewhere, new data show female start-up bosses who succeed in raising a first round of venture capital funding are (ever so slightly) more likely than men to attract second-round funding. The statistics shine a stark light on how by far the biggest hurdle for female entrepreneurs comes in the initial stages of setting up a business, rather than later on. In a completely different world, Sifted looks at how insurer Munich Re’s innovation unit has developed an AI programme to analyse before and after pictures from disaster zones to speed up the claims process. The company is pushing to work with start-ups to help transform the insurance industry. Holoride, a start-up spun out of luxury carmaker Audi, has teamed up with Ford and Universal Pictures to showcase the world’s first “in-car virtual reality experience”. Its software enables gaming partners such as Disney to create virtual experiences that correspond to a car’s real-time movements, writes Patrick McGee in San Francisco.Passengers wear a headset to immerse themselves in a virtual environment. Then, Holoride takes data from the car — including GPS, navigation route, the steering angle and g-forces from acceleration — and translates these in real time into a virtual environment. So when the car goes from 0-60mph and takes a corner, the passenger’s virtual environment accelerates and takes the turn, too — but in space, or underwater, or in some comic-book fantasy world.

1;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2019-05-26T17:03:06Z;‘Candy Crush’ developer’s chief Riccardo Zacconi steps down;Co-founder of King, owned by Activision Blizzard, will become chairman;Riccardo Zacconi is stepping down as chief executive of King, after more than 16 years leading the Candy Crush games developer.London-based King’s parent company, Activision Blizzard, announced the change in a regulatory filing on Friday afternoon. Activision Blizzard paid $5.9bn to acquire King Digital Entertainment in February 2016, marking a big move into mobile gaming from the California-based company behind the Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft franchises. The deal remains one of the biggest takeovers of a UK-based tech company in recent years. Candy Crush is one of the most profitable smartphone apps of all time. The puzzle game and its various spin-offs have stayed in the top 10 highest grossing games in the US for more than five years. However, Candy Crush’s popularity has waned since King’s takeover, with the company’s overall monthly active users falling from 449m in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 272m in the first quarter of 2019. King had net revenues of $2.1bn in 2018, just under a third of Activision Blizzard’s $6.8bn total in the last financial year. In the first quarter of 2019, King posted its second consecutive quarter of audience growth after a period of decline. Players now spent an average of 38 minutes every day on Candy Crush games, the company said. Mr Zacconi, a former management consultant, co-founded King and has served as its chief executive since 2003. Mr Zacconi did not immediately respond to requests for more details about his departure on Sunday. An Activision Blizzard spokesperson declined to comment further.In January, Activision Blizzard named Humam Sakhnini as King’s president, saying at the time he would “oversee all operational management in partnership with” Mr Zacconi. Mr Sakhnini had led King’s acquisition as Activision Blizzard’s head of strategy and talent before becoming King’s chief financial officer and chief strategy officer in April 2016.$19.8mRiccardo Zacconi’s pay for 2018, including bonuses and stock option awardsAfter he leaves his full-time position as chief executive on July 1, Mr Zacconi will become King’s chairman, providing “guidance to the management” at both King and Activision Blizzard. For what is expected to be two days’ work a month as chairman, he will be paid a base salary of £100,000 a year, plus a portion of King’s profits. According to regulatory filings published last month, Mr Zacconi was awarded total compensation for 2018 of $19.8m, including bonuses and stock option awards, making him Activision Blizzard’s second-highest-paid executive after group chief Bobby Kotick. Mr Zacconi’s total compensation for 2018 includes a $3.6m share of King’s profits that was contingent on his continued employment until September 2019. Regulatory filings show that Mr Zacconi was due to receive certain performance-related stock awards on the three-year anniversary of the King acquisition’s closing in February 2019. Earlier this month, the Sunday Times Rich List estimated Mr Zacconi’s wealth at £395m. The newspaper’s annual list ranks him among the richest video-game executives in Britain, alongside King’s former chairman Mel Morris, its co-founder Sebastian Knutsson, and Sam and Dan Houser, the brothers who founded Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar Games.
2;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2019-02-12T22:35:07Z;Activision Blizzard to cut staff by 8% as sales growth underwhelms;;Activision Blizzard announced on Tuesday it will cut about 8 per cent of its workforce and boost investments in its biggest games, helping to offset some of the disappointment brought about by its soft 2019 outlook.The video game maker, known for gaming franchises such as Call of Duty, Warcraft and Candy Crush, said it will cut back on projects that are not meeting expectations, reduce non-development and administrative costs and integrate some operations.The corporate shake-up will allow Activision Blizzard to increase the number of developers working on its top franchises by 20 per cent over the course of 2019, the company said, which helped push its shares higher in after-hours trade on Tuesday.Chief executive Bobby Kotick said in a statement Activision Blizzard had made “a number of important leadership changes,” noting: “While our financial results for 2018 were the best in our history, we didn’t realise our full potential.”Activision Blizzard will take a pre-tax charge of about $150m, the majority of which will be booked this year, in relation to the restructuring.News of the lay-offs came as Activision Blizzard delivered a disappointing outlook for 2019 amid softer sales than expected.For 2019, the California-based company forecast net bookings of $6.3bn, well below analysts’ average estimate of $7.3bn. Earnings are expected to hit $1.85 a share on an adjusted basis, also missing a consensus estimate of $2.54.Activision Blizzard projected first-quarter earnings of 63 cents a share on net bookings of $1.18bn. Analysts were looking for 46 cents a share and $1.45bn.Activision Blizzard has said sales of Destiny 2: Forsaken were slower than it anticipated following the game’s launch in September, while other titles had seen flat or declining numbers of players.The broader video game industry has also struggled of late. Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive revealed disappointing revenue forecasts last week, fuelling concerns that free-to-play online games such as Fortnite are cutting into sales of console games. Fortnite generated $2.4bn in revenue in 2018, according to SuperData, and had more than 200m registered players as of November.Optimism that EA has created a blockbuster Fortnite rival powered a recent recovery in the company’s stock. EA said late Monday more than 25m players had signed up to play Apex Legends in its first week or release, sending shares another 5.2 per cent higher on Tuesday.Activision Blizzard shares closed 3.9 per cent higher in advance of the company’s earnings report and extended their gains in after-hours trade, climbing 4.4 per cent, on word of the cost cuts.The group registered net bookings of $2.84bn in the December quarter, a record high but short of Wall Street’s estimate of $3.04bn.Net income was $650m, or 84 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $584m, or 77 cents a share. Adjusted earnings of 90 cents a share missed analysts’ forecast of $1.28.
3;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2019-02-04T18:38:33Z;Apple should buy Netflix, Sonos or Activision Blizzard, JPMorgan says;;If Apple’s $245bn cash pile is burning a hole in its pocket, it could do worse than buy Netflix, according to analysts at JPMorgan.The investment bank speculated that Netflix, video-game developer Activision Blizzard and speaker maker Sonos are the best strategic fits should Apple seek large acquisitions to drive growth, particularly in its services business.“While investors hardly seem to be complaining about the massive buyback pace, including ~$73bn last year, we believe they do hope the firm uses its balance sheet strength to insulate the business against often-seen disruptions in the technology landscape, some of which Apple itself has driven in the past,” JPMorgan analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note to clients on Monday.Apple shocked Wall Street last month when it unveiled a rare downgrade to its guidance, saying revenue would fall short of its expectations as sales in China weakened and customers wait longer to upgrade their iPhones. Last week, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant reported $84.3bn in revenue for the quarter ending in December, down 5 per cent year-over-year. Sales in the current quarter are forecast to drop as much as 10 per cent.With many technology names trading below 52-week highs, Mr Chatterjee called it an “opportune time” for Apple to use its strong balance sheet to refocus on growth potential in services, a segment that includes Apple Music and the App Store, and whose sales jumped 19 per cent in the most recent quarter.Netflix represents the best strategic fit for Apple in the video content space, although a tie-up with the popular streaming service would be expensive, he said. Mr Chatterjee believes Netflix would command a “much higher premium” than 20 per cent, which would give the company an enterprise value of $189bn. Netflix had a market value of $148bn as of Friday’s close, in addition to $7bn in net debt.But scooping up Netflix would accelerate Apple’s plans to create original video content, according to JPMorgan.“Video streaming, including original video content, is a highly competitive market with established traditional media houses as well new entrants fighting aggressively for incremental subscribers, which is likely to make it difficult to scale any new platform to compete effectively,” Mr Chatterjee said, noting that Netflix had 139m global paid subscribers by the end of 2018.He added: “With media/video consumption expected to increasingly move to mobile devices, Apple could fortify its ecosystem with the acquisition of one of the largest on-demand content providers.”In video gaming, JPMorgan suggested Activision Blizzard would be a strategic fit given the market’s shift towards mobile gaming. A hypothetical Sonos acquisition would help enhance the value of Apple Music and bolster the company’s smart home products, the note said.Spokespeople for Sonos and Activision Blizzard declined to comment. Apple and Netflix didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares in Apple were trading 2.6 per cent higher at $170.83 on Monday afternoon. Netflix rallied 2.7 per cent, while Sonos surged 7 per cent. Activision Blizzard shares rose 1.5 per cent.Electronic Arts, which JPMorgan said was a less ideal merger partner than Activision Blizzard, was one of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100. Shares were down 2.7 per cent.
4;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2019-01-03T22:14:06Z;Square taps Blizzard’s Ahuja as new finance chief;;Square on Thursday named Amrita Ahuja its new chief financial officer replacing Sarah Friar, who announced in October that she would be leaving the digital payments company.Ms Ahuja joins from Blizzard Entertainment, a division of game publisher Activision Blizzard, where she most recently served as finance chief having held various positions at Activision over the past eight years. Before that, Ms Ahuja served various roles at Fox Networks, the Walt Disney Company and Morgan Stanley.“Amrita brings the ability to consider and balance opportunities across our entire business, and she will help strengthen our discipline as we invest, build, and scale,” said Square chief executive Jack Dorsey. “She is willing to challenge herself and others, has the courage to take principled risks, and is passionate about our customers and our purpose.”Her appointment comes amid reports the San Francisco-based company is looking to revive its request to start a bank in Utah.She succeeds Ms Friar, who departed the company in November to spend time with her family before taking on the role of chief executive officer at Nextdoor. Square shares tumbled nearly 30 per cent since Ms Friar announced her exit in October to the end of last year.Meanwhile, Ms Ahuja’s departure marks the latest exit from video game maker Activision. Streaming service Netflix on Wednesday named Spencer Neumann as its new finance chief. Mr Neumann most recently served in that role at Activision until he was fired this week “for violating his legal obligations to the Company”.Square shares climbed 1.5 per cent to $52.81 in after-hours trade having climbed 62 per cent last year.
5;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2019-01-02T17:56:04Z;Netflix names Activision Blizzard’s Neumann as new finance chief;;Streaming service Netflix on Wednesday named media veteran Spencer Neumann as its new finance chief, just days after he was terminated from his job at video game maker Activision Blizzard.Mr Neumann replaces David Wells who had been Netflix’s finance head since 2010.“Spencer is a stellar entertainment executive and we’re thrilled that he will help us provide amazing stories to people all over the world,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive officer.Mr Neumann most recently served as Activision’s CFO, a position he has held since May 2017. Before that, he had worked at The Walt Disney Company and private equity firms of Providence Equity Partners and Summit Partners.The appointment of Mr Neumann comes as Netflix looks to ramp up its investment in original content in the US and overseas. The company behind The Crown and BirdBox secured more than $2bn through a bond offering in October to finance its heavy spending on original movies and television shows.Activision said in a filing on Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had placed Mr Neumann on a paid leave of absence and intended to terminate his employment “for cause unrelated to the Company’s financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures”.On Wednesday, Activision said Mr Neumann was fired “for violating his legal obligations to the Company”.Reuters had previously reported that Netflix would announce that it had poached Mr Neumann.“Netflix is a singular brand, and I’m excited and honoured for the opportunity to work with the Netflix team and all of our stakeholders to build on the company’s exceptional track record of success and innovation,” Mr Neumann said.Netflix shares were down 1.2 per cent on Wednesday following a 39 per cent rise last year.
6;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;New Call of Duty launch helps maker score major points with Wall Street;;Major buzz for the latest iteration of its wildly popular Call of Duty gaming franchise has put Activision Blizzard shares on track for their best day in more than a year.Shares of the California-based company were up 6.5 per cent to $79.08 on Tuesday, setting them on course for their largest one-day percentage rise since February 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.The power move comes a day after Activision Blizzard began rolling out Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, Blackout Private Beta for the PlayStation 4 console. The latest addition to the Call of Duty shooter game franchise has a “battle royale” mode, which combines survival-style play with last-man-standing combat.The mode is similar to the format of smash gaming hit Fortnite, the popularity of which has struck fear into some of the biggest video game makers, Activision Blizzard included.With the latest Call of Duty offering, however, some gamers have speculated that Activision could have a Fortnite “killer” on its hands, according to a report on Tuesday from Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey:“Call of Duty is the largest shooter franchise on console, Black Ops if the most popular COD sub-franchise and BR (battle royale) is the hottest game mode in the world, where Blackout may have just taken the genre to a new level. We believe Blackout will be a potentially massive hit, and drive up to +$500M in incremental annual recurrent digital monies. We believe the game will migrate investor focus from the Fortnite led BR competitive threat to the opportunity for BR in driving meaningful growth.”The embrace of the battle royale mode is another encouraging sign, Mr Hickey said, especially since it is more conducive to live gaming events, which are growing quickly in popularity around the world.“The BR genre has demonstrated exceptional viewability, and is opportune for esports, mobile and advertising opportunities, an area where the Company has developed an extensive playbook. We recently considered that Fortnite may have peaked, and long term retention remains unclear, Blackout may have timed the market perfectly.”So far this year, Activision Blizzard shares are up almost 25 per cent, following a 75 per cent gain in 2017.
7;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2018-08-15T16:11:56Z;US video game stocks hit by Tencent woes and China red tape;;Shares in US video game makers sank on Wednesday, following Asian counterparts lower amid media reports that authorities in China, the world’s biggest gaming market, had halted approvals for new mobile games as the sector undergoes a broader bureaucratic overhaul.The regulatory unease weighed on profits and shares of China’s Tencent, the world’s biggest video game maker. Tencent carries a large weighting in both the Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and emerging markets indices, adding to the geopolitical concerns already afflicting EM assets.An estimated 3,000 titles have been awaiting approval for commercial launch since March, when China overhauled the government bodies that oversee the $38bn industry there. Even though consumers are able to play the new games, developers have been unable to make money from them.Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that China had stopped approving new mobile games as part of its reform of the market. Approvals for online, console and mobile games have been stalled for months owing to the overhaul of government agencies.That political roadblock contributed to a rare drop in profit for Tencent, the world’s biggest video game maker, during the quarter. Beijing this week ordered the company to halt sales of a video game, Monster Hunter: World, just days after it was released. Tencent’s Hong Kong-listed shares ended Wednesday 3.4 per cent lower ahead of the release of the results.“It’s worth noting that Tencent is a widely held security within ETFs, particularly the [iShares MSCI Emerging Markets] and [iShares China FTSE/Shinhua 25 Index] ETFs, which should be effected [sic] by the negative earnings report,” wrote strategists at Cantor Fitzgerald.Douglas Morton, head of Research Asia at Northern Trust Capital Markets, wrote: “In a market highly sensitive to downside sentiment, today’s Tencent result could prove a fresh (and entirely uncorrelated) catalyst for continued Emerging Market pressure in our opinion, given their position alongside Baidu and Alibaba of making up one-tenth of the MSCI EM by market cap.”In the US on Wednesday, shares in Electronic Arts were down 3.2 per cent, Activision Blizzard was down 3.1 per cent and Take-Two Interactive fell 2.2 per cent. The S&P 500 was down 1 per cent.The disappointment with Tencent’s result and broader EM concerns weighed on US-listed China stocks, with ecommerce sites Alibaba and JD.com down 3.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, while search engine company Baidu fell 2.5 per cent.On Wednesday in Japan, Nintendo closed 3 per cent lower, Capcom — maker of the Monster Hunter series — was down 2.7 per cent. Konami was down 4.2 per cent.
8;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2018-07-11T16:32:27Z;Disney’s ESPN puts videogaming on primetime TV;Deal to broadcast Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League is a breakthrough for esports;Competitive videogaming will be given its first test before mainstream sports viewers on primetime US television this month, after Activision Blizzard signed a broadcast deal with Walt Disney’s ESPN. The tie-up means that the finals of Blizzard’s Overwatch League — in which teams of six players compete in a futuristic shootout — will be shown live on ESPN’s main sports channel at 7pm on a Friday night at the end of this month, followed by highlights on Disney’s ABC channel. The live TV broadcast of the final games of the first season of the Overwatch League will mark a new milestone for esports, which is rapidly becoming one of the gaming industry’s biggest growth drivers.“This is exactly the kind of deal you would expect as esports moves from being the experimental niche offer that [US sports broadcasters] were using it for, towards becoming a more substantial sport,” said Dan Cryan, analyst at IHS Markit. “It’s right to see this as the first notable transitional deal in the US, as esports begins to grow up.” In the US, TV broadcasters have been searching with increasing urgency for ways to reach younger viewers, who have been tuning out of traditional sports such as football and baseball. Games companies have been looking to bring esports into the mainstream. However, it is unclear how older viewers, who are accustomed to more traditional displays of sporting prowess and athleticism, will respond to the rather different dynamics of esports, where small teams of young men sit in specially designed chairs pounding their keyboards and mice. The Overwatch League Grand Finals is by far our most comprehensive television distribution for an esports event over a single weekendDedicated esports channels have been around for several years, such as Modern Times Group’s Electronic Sports League, Sky-backed Ginx in the UK and OGN in South Korea. Millions of viewers watch tournaments on streaming sites such as Amazon’s Twitch, where Blizzard has previously struck an online broadcasting deal for Overwatch reported to be worth $90m. Terms of its agreement with ESPN were not disclosed. Overwatch was designed by Activision Blizzard specifically for esports and it has sold team franchises such as London Spitfire and Los Angeles Gladiators to a range of investors from both traditional sports and the tech industry. Walt Disney group broadcasters have ventured into esports before — including televised tournaments with publisher Electronic Arts for its Madden and Fifa games, with ESL focused on Street Fighter and with Nintendo across titles such as Super Smash Bros— but the multiyear deal with Blizzard is its biggest commitment of airtime yet. “The Overwatch League Grand Finals is by far our most comprehensive television distribution for an esports event over a single weekend,” said Justin Connolly, executive vice-president of affiliate sales and marketing at Disney and ESPN Media Networks. For Activision Blizzard, the deal with ESPN will provide a boost to its flagship esports title at a time when newcomer Fortnite is stealing the limelight. The online multiplayer “battle royale” game Fortnite, made by Tencent-backed Epic Games, has become a huge phenomenon, especially among US teens. Star players such as Ninja attract millions of viewers on Twitch and YouTube. In May, Epic said it would provide $100m worth of prizes in the first year of competitive Fortnite play. However, it has so far shied away from selling teams or franchises as Blizzard has with Overwatch. 
9;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Esports: virtual gains;Epic Games is set to provide $100m in prizes for its popular ‘Fortnite Battle Royale’;Being paid to play computer games sounds like a teenager’s dream. Esports have made it real — thanks to millions of global fans who want to watch professional gamers in action. The rise of video game tournaments threatens to upend the profitability of traditional game publishers.Esports attract 300m followers who regularly watch competitive events — a figure that consultancy Newzoo expects to double in five years.High viewing figures attract sponsorship — $500m in 2017 according to Newzoo — raising player winnings. Epic Games said this week it would provide $100m in prizes for its popular Fortnite Battle Royale. Sponsorship, media rights, in-game purchases and tickets make free-to-play games lucrative. Fortnite generated about $300m in revenues for its owner Epic Games, in which Tencent has a stake, in April alone.Playing Fortnite leaves less time for the other games, which rely on sales of software. Shares in Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard both dipped in April as Fortnite became a global phenomenon.Competitors are wise to be moving in on esports. More than 11bn esports videos were streamed last year in China. Fans are usually young men who follow non-virtual sporting events too. That gives an edge to video games makers such as Electronic Arts. Its Fifa football game has spawned its own esport events.Tencent dominates for now — with Fortnite and League of Legends. Activision Blizzard is building up its offer. Nintendo is late but catching up. The sector’s own Battle Royale is still in play.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters
10;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2018-05-04T11:23:44Z;Activision Blizzard: dead dangerous;Video games publisher has plenty to fear from rivals;Activision lists “film, TV, social networking, music and other consumer products” under “competition” in its annual report. The bigger threat is closer to home. It comes from rival computer games businesses intent on disrupting the industry.In first-quarter results, Activision reported 374m monthly active users and a 14 per cent increase in revenues to $2bn. The biggest contribution to users was from Candy Crush, which came to Activision in 2016 via its $6bn acquisition of King Entertainment. That deal looked smart at the time, adding mobile gaming to heavy-duty console shooters such as Call of Duty. Activision is also ahead of the pack in tapping in on the baffling development of video games as a spectator sport.Yet the first game mentioned by chief executive Bobby Kotick on the conference call is from a competitor. This time he was not being modest. Fortnite, made by Epic Games, which is 40 per cent-owned by Tencent, is a perturbing challenger. It is one reason Activision shares have fallen more than a tenth from their March high.Zombie shooter Fortnite scrambles existing categories. It can be played on both smartphones and games consoles, and it is free. There may be value in Activision’s expensive stable of game franchises. But the quick surge of popularity from Fortnite and another so-called “battle royale” multi-player game PUBG is a missed opportunity.The solution is to steal the format, or as Mr Kotick put it: “When we see things that appeal to our audiences, we are very good at being inspired by those.” That however raises questions about Activision’s ability to charge $60 for a game that resembles a free alternative.Despite this strong quarter, revenue growth is nothing to shout about at an expected 5 per cent this year. The hyper-growth that last year’s stock surge suggested is absent. Activision has little to dread from TV or social networks but plenty to fear from rivals undeterred by its past success.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

11;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2018-05-04T02:16:04Z;Activision Blizzard sales hit by success of rival’s ‘Fortnite’;Video gaming publisher in ‘battle royale’ with developer of shooter title;Activision Blizzard, the world’s most valuable video gaming publisher, admitted on Thursday that its sales were taking a hit from Fortnite, the “battle royale” shooting game that has suddenly become a global phenomenon.In little more than six months, Fortnite has attracted tens of millions of players around the world, particularly among school children. The game, which can be played on mobile devices, PCs or consoles, sees up to 100 players hang-glide on to an island, build defences and then fight to the death until only one winner is left alive.While the title is free for anyone to download and play, Fortnite’s developer, Tencent-backed Epic Games, is estimated to be making hundreds of millions of dollars a month from in-game purchases of outfits and accessories for players’ characters.Activision Blizzard’s share price has fallen about 15 per cent from its peak of $77.82 in early March, as Wall Street grew concerned that gamers would be abandoning its popular franchises, such as Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga, to play Fortnite instead.Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, acknowledged the competitive threat on Thursday, telling analysts on an earnings call: “Gaming is constantly evolving and innovating, which often expands the marketplace, and the success of Fortnite is no exception.”Although Activision Blizzard posted first-quarter results ahead of Wall Street’s expectations, with net revenues up 14 per cent to $1.97bn, its outlook for the rest of the year fell short of analysts’ estimates.Spencer Neumann, chief financial officer, acknowledged that the company had seen “some near-term impact” from Fortnite.Both executives insisted that the emergence of the new “battle royale” concept presented an opportunity as well as a threat. They hinted that its developers could add the same kind of gameplay to its existing shooting titles, such as Call of Duty and Destiny.“[Fortnite] is attracting new players of all ages and gender, and it is helping gaming become even more mainstream entertainment,” Mr Kotick said. “In the long history of our company, when we see people innovate in an interesting and impactful way, we are very quick to figure out how to capture inspirations from innovation.”Activision Blizzard would not be the first company to copy the “battle royale” format. Epic Games itself took inspiration last year from the overnight success of Player Unknown: Battlegrounds, another multiplayer “death match” game that is still in development.The number of Fortnite players overtook Player Unknown: Battlegrounds, thanks to its more cartoonish and approachable graphics, said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. He estimates that Fortnite will make as much as $1bn in revenues this year.However, with much of that money coming from people who were not previously playing shooting games, Mr Pachter believes its damage to Activision Blizzard will be limited.“My guess is the impact was a downdraught of $30m,” he said. “When Call of Duty has a ‘battle royale’ mode, you will go back to it, because that’s where your friends are playing, the weapons will be better and it is more realistic.”
12;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Activision Blizzard releases early earnings after results leak;;Activision Blizzard pulled the veil back a bit early on its quarterly earnings report, after its embargoed results reportedly leaked earlier in the day.The gaming company behind the popular Call of Duty and Destiny titles was due to report first-quarter results after the closing bell later on Thursday. However, Dow Jones newswire confirmed to CNBC that it had inadvertently released some incorrect earnings figures before the scheduled release time, causing Activision Blizzard shares to jump briefly then falling more than 5 per cent until trading was halted.After the snafu, Activision Blizzard went ahead and pulled the trigger, releasing its full results.For the three months ending in March, net revenue hit a record $1.97bn, up nearly 14 per cent from $1.73bn reported in the year-ago period. Net income came in at $500m, or 65 cents a share, with adjusted earnings per share coming in at 78 cents, up from 72 cents last year and better than the 65 cents it had guided for.Analysts had been looking for sales of $1.33bn, with net income of $282m, or 54 cents a share, according to Factset. Adjusted earnings were tipped to come in at 34 cents a share.Bobby Kotick, chief executive, said:“Activision Blizzard had another strong quarter, growing year-over-year, setting top and bottom line records, and over-performing guidance. Our continued ability to set new records speaks to the quality of our teams and the breadth and enduring nature of our portfolio of franchises against the backdrop of a large and growing interactive market. As we look ahead, our innovative core gaming pipeline, as well as initiatives like mobile, esports, and advertising, will continue to drive growth for our business.”Some analysts had worried that Activision Blizzard may have slipped in the quarter, thanks to the surge in popularity of rival Epic Games’ Fortnite game, as well as the lack of blockbuster releases from Activision Blizzard in the quarter.But the results released on Thursday prompted Activision Blizzard to nudge higher its full-year outlook, citing confidence in its franchises and pipeline. It is now looking for net revenues of $7.355bn, from $7.350bn previously, and earnings a share of $1.79, and adjusted earnings of $2.46 a share, a penny more than it had previously guided for both metrics.It also released guidance for the current quarter, pencilling in net revenues of $1.55bn, earnings per share of 26 cents and adjusted earnings of 46 cents a share.Analysts had previously forecast sales of $1.5bn, earnings per share of 40 cents and adjusted earnings of 47 cents, according to Factset.After trading resumed, Activision Blizzard shares rose 1 per cent. Its shares rose 75.4 per cent last year and are up 2.5 per cent so far in 2018.
13;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2017-11-05T01:15:25Z;Activision Blizzard pitches Overwatch for esports market;World’s largest games publisher looks for new revenue source ;Activision Blizzard pitched its forthcoming Overwatch League to thousands of gamers at this weekend’s Blizzcon event, as it looks to grab a larger slice of the fast-growing esports market. Esports has gained a huge following from hundreds of millions of people around the world, who tune in to watch live, competitive videogaming. Activision Blizzard, which is the world’s largest games publisher, is targeting the market as a key new source of growth, with most of its efforts focused on its 18-month-old fantasy shooter, Overwatch. The first 12 Overwatch League team owners are drawn from traditional sports, including Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, the Boston-based American football team, and Jeff Wilpon, chief operating officer of the New York Mets baseball team, and so-called “endemics” — esports specialists such as Immortals, Misfits and NRG. Uniquely among large esports leagues, each team is associated with a city around the world, from London Spitfire to Houston Outlaws and Shanghai Dragons. The latest teams — Misfits’ Florida Mayhem and Los Angeles Gladiators, owned by the company behind the LA Rams NFL team — were announced this week. At Blizzcon, its annual convention in Anaheim in southern California, Blizzard also unveiled changes within the Overwatch game that it hopes will make it more accessible to casual viewers as well as hardcore gamers. These include new camera angles for spectators and “home and away” team colours that make it easier to follow the fast-paced action. “Being an esports fan, for a long time you had to work at it,” said Nate Nanzer, the league’s commissioner in an interview. “We want to make it super easy to be an Overwatch League fan.” Blizzard is launching a new destination Overwatch League website and app for fans to follow their favourite teams, from the latest scores to player profile videos that will spotlight the people sitting behind the keyboard, controlling the on-screen characters. “One of the things we want to focus on is telling the story of these players,” Mr Nanzer said. “In traditional sports, you build that bond. We want to make sure fans know our players better and create content that humanises this.” When building the Overwatch League’s franchise-based structure, Blizzard did a “complete audit of traditional sports leagues”, Mr Nanzer said, from NFL football and MLB baseball in the US to Premier League football in England. “We are building an entire sport from scratch … It was very important to have consistency and stability for teams and players,” he said. “Esports, because it grew organically, was very fragmented …We wanted to really professionalise it.” That approach is starting to win over the advertisers who, alongside broadcasting rights deals and merchandising, Blizzard is hoping will make esports into a significant money spinner. On Thursday, it announced that Intel and HP will be the Overwatch League’s lead sponsors. “The percentage [of Intel’s marketing budget] that we're investing into esports is growing as part of our portfolio — it's becoming a significant item,” said John Bonini, Intel vice-president of esports and gaming. “The city-based structure with a franchising model struck our attention. It's a great partnership with Blizzard that we want to continue for multiple years.”December will see the first pre-season Overwatch League matches played at the purpose-built Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, with the full league starting on January 10. “We believe 2018 will be the year that esports becomes even more broad in its appeal,” Activision Blizzard chief executive Bobby Kotick said during Thursday’s earnings call with analysts. “We view that as a major growth initiative and a very sizeable standalone opportunity for the company.”
14;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2017-10-15T05:10:57Z;Rovio sees public listing catapulting it into M&A;CEO of Angry Birds maker says recent IPO gives it the shares to act as consolidator;The maker of Angry Birds is positioning itself as a consolidator in the fledgling mobile gaming industry after successfully listing itself on the stock market. Kati Levoranta, chief executive of Rovio Entertainment, said that the Finnish group’s record as well as its ability to use its shares in deals meant that it was well placed in an industry that is highly fragmented. “With the expertise we have built in-house related to free-to-play and user acquisition, we believe we can act as a consolidator and bring value to others. As we’re a public company now, if wanted, we can use the shares more efficiently to do M&A,” she told the Financial Times. Rovio became one of the largest mobile gaming groups to list when it floated in Helsinki at the end of September, with a valuation of about €900m. Its shares have since largely trod water as investors grapple with how to value such companies, due to the often ephemeral nature of success in mobile gaming. On Friday afternoon, they traded at €11.48 compared with a listing price of €11.50. The Finnish group has struggled to replicate the success of its first Angry Birds title, which was a paid-for app that became the most downloaded game in history and led to a reported valuation of €9bn. It has since moved towards so-called freemium games, which are free to play, but where users can pay for special powers or to speed things up. Ms Levoranta said the listing of companies such as Next Games, Paradox Interactive and Rovio in the Nordics showed that the industry was maturing. “It strengthens the fact that we are a gaming hub in the Nordics,” she added. The biggest gaming groups in the region have all been sold to competitors, reducing public scrutiny of their activities. China’s Tencent paid $8.6bn for an 84 per cent stake in Supercell, arguably the most successful mobile group with titles such as Clash Royale and Hay Day, while Activision Blizzard paid $5.9bn for King Digital and Microsoft bought Mojang for $2.5bn. Analysts have queried Rovio’s dependence on Angry Birds and whether it can remain successful. But the company can point to the $350m the Angry Birds Movie took at the box office last year, with a sequel on the way. Ms Levoranta argued there were increasing advantages for the biggest companies in terms of brand recognition and lowering the costs of enticing players to try their games — so-called “user acquisition”. “What a brand gives is discoverability. There are 700 new games launched every day. You can discover our games easier, which pushes user acquisition costs down,” she said. Rovio is also looking closely at augmented and virtual reality “to see how we position ourselves,” she said. Investors should expect to hear more from Rovio shortly on those trends, possible acquisition targets, and how it might target Asian countries more, including China, Ms Levoranta added.

The business doubled its revenues to £3m in the past financial year.George Potts of NorthEdge, who will join the board, said there was potential in film making and social media, which is tapping into virtual technology. Its software could be used for meetings on sites such as Facebook Spaces, which want to create lifelike avatars of participants so they can react more naturally to each other.“Cubic Motion has leading technology with a rapidly growing addressable market. There is a lot of interest from VR headset makers and social media companies,” he said.Cubic tracked the face of actress Melina Juergens as she performed as Hellblade’s lead character, Senua. She wore a helmet and semi-circular face guard holding a camera analysing her facial movements. They are transposed in real time on to the character.Cubic Motion has leading technology with a rapidly growing addressable market. There is a lot of interest from VR headset makers and social media companiesMr Potts said this technique could also shorten shooting times for movies. They could review animated footage in real time, called a “live drive”.Usually motion capture scenes are processed by an animator, days after they have been shot, and might then have to be redone. “You can really get the costs of production down,” said Mr Potts.Hellblade, from independent British producer Ninja Theory, retails for £29.99 rather than the £50-plus typical of popular video games.Gareth Edwards, chief executive of Cubic Motion, said organic growth could take it only so far. “Aided by NorthEdge’s investment and experience, we will deploy an expanding range of licensed software solutions, bringing real-time vision and animation capabilities direct to our clients and partners, revolutionising the way content is made.”NorthEdge Capital manages £540m of private equity funds and typically invests between £5m-£45m, usually in England’s north and Midlands regions. It has done four deals and sold two of its investments in 2017.
16;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2017-08-03T21:04:43Z;Activision posts upbeat quarterly results but misses on outlook;;Revenues and earnings at games publisher Activision Blizzard topped Wall Street expectations in the latest quarter as Overwatch and its mobile games continued to make up for a decline in its console business.The company also raised its earnings forecast for the rest of this year. The more optimistic outlook, issued after the market closed, followed a 4 per cent share price bounce earlier in the day and capped a 77 per cent rise for the year so far. The stock price slipped slightly in after-market trading.Excluding deferred revenues, Activision reported revenues of $1.42bn, some 16 per cent ahead of analysts’ expectations. However, they were down 12 per cent from a year before, when sales were boosted by the launch of Overwatch. Pro forma earnings per share, at 43 cents, topped expectations of 30 cents.The company raised its earnings forecast for the second half of the year to $2, from the previous $1.88, however that missed analysts’ forecasts for earnings of $2.02 a share.Bobby Kotick, chief executive officer, said that Activision was benefitting from stronger engagement with its audiences, thanks to initiatives like an e-sports league tied to Overwatch, which now has more than 30m players.However, King, maker of Candy Crush, suffered a decline in revenue in the latest period. Activision said “numerous” efforts were underway to build the size of King’s audience and return it to growth, though these would “take time” to yield results.
17;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2017-07-16T16:21:14Z;Video gaming adopts intercity rivalry to break into major league sport;Esport groups team up with NFL and baseball execs to create professional league;The backers of esports are turning to the model of intercity rivalries, made successful by traditional games such as baseball and football, to try to propel competitive video gaming into a lucrative mass-market sport. The parent companies behind the New England Patriots NFL team and baseball’s New York Mets were among those picking up franchises in the past week, in the first serious attempt to create a professional league for esports that encourages real-world spectators in their team’s local areas.In an attempt to expand its appeal beyond the millions watching globally on sites such as Amazon’s Twitch, Activision Blizzard, the largest US video games publisher, is selling teams for its Overwatch League to owners in New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai and beyond, demanding multimillion-dollar commitments to invest in local events, promotions and merchandising in each individual city.“It is incredibly important to use that localised model to tap into a fan base of esports that doesn’t exist yet,” says Noah Whinston, chief executive of the esports team Immortals, which bought up rights to Overwatch’s Los Angeles franchise. “Having live event experiences and local teams creates a level of engagement and passion that you just can’t access as well through a computer screen.” The concept is hooking in investors from traditional sports as well as videogaming veterans. Activision Blizzard announced this week that the first Overwatch League franchise owners included Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, the Boston-based American football team, and Jeff Wilpon, chief operating officer of the New York Mets baseball team. Having live event experiences and local teams creates a level of engagement and passion that you just can’t access as well through a computer screen. Bringing familiar sporting staples such as stadium games and team kit to esports will also help to attract new advertisers who have so far sat on the sidelines, says Mr Wilpon. “What we’ve heard from some of our big sponsors is they are all looking for the right opportunity to get into esports.”Income from advertising, merchandising and broadcast rights will be essential if esports teams and operators are to recoup a significant upfront investment in these new leagues. Bidders on city franchises for the Overwatch League, and a similar new venture run by Tencent-owned Riot Games, will together spend about a quarter of a billion dollars this year to be among the first team owners. Riot is charging $10m apiece for roughly 10 places in its North American League of Legends Championship Series, while Activision Blizzard is said to be charging $20m to its first seven franchisees.“It was a bit of a leap of faith for us to make that move,” says Chris Hopper, head of league operations at Riot. “A lot of sports owners wanted to see an element of stability from us before they got too involved.” Some 43m unique viewers watched last year’s League of Legends World Championship online, up from 8m in 2012, with the finals selling out large venues such as LA’s Staples Center and Seoul’s World Cup stadium. “There is clearly a significant business opportunity here,” analysts at Macquarie wrote in a research note this week. Macquarie forecasts that the esports market will grow from $892m last year to $5bn by 2020, including sponsorship, media rights, merchandise, ticketing and betting. “Having city-based teams could potentially expand the addressable market and viewership, and enhance the value of media rights,” its analysts say.Overwatch and League of Legends are among the leading examples of team-based PC gaming, a model that allows for a combination of more strategic play than is typically associated with one-on-one play. The games are sophisticated enough to allow for the emergence of individual star players with their own particular characters and abilities, as well as the development of a narrative around a team’s progress through a season.Both Riot and Blizzard’s initiatives offer team owners greater predictability than previous leagues, for instance by removing the threat of relegation and establishing a transparent revenue-sharing model, while players will also benefit from minimum salaries and benefits such as healthcare. “I think it’s a sizeable commitment, but we are going to see an excellent return over the next five to 10 years,” Mr Wilpon says. “The goal is to build a franchise and a community of people around this game . . . If that happens, it will pay for itself many times over.”Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard’s chief executive, noted that the LA Clippers basketball team was worth $13m in the early 1980s, before being sold for $2bn to Steve Ballmer, former Microsoft chief, in 2014. “I think anybody that is coming into the opportunity today is coming in on the ground floor of something that is truly a terrific opportunity for owners.” While esports are taking some lessons from the traditional sporting industry, the Overwatch League’s combination of city-based teams playing in a global contest is a novel model. Outside of the Uefa Champions League in football, a city-based global league “doesn’t exist” in professional sports, Mr Kotick said. “That is what we attempted to do.”Trying to bridge the online and offline gaming communities is risky, according to industry analyst Dan Cryan of IHS Markit. “A lot of esports fans spend an awful lot of their time online and their communities are online communities.” Aggregated globally, that audience looks large, but on a local level, esports has not yet reached critical mass. “We don’t have an answer at this point to how important those real-world communities are,” he said. 
18;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2017-05-14T14:51:40Z;Activision: Out of their league;Shareholders have got something better than a private equity bid;At the start of the year Activision was rumoured to be the subject of a leveraged buyout. If that were ever on the cards — the video games maker declined to comment — it now looks a monumental stretch. The shares have risen by more than half this year, giving Activision an enterprise value of $42bn. It is expected to make only $2.5bn this year in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Buyouts that require leverage of more than six times debt/ebitda, as this likely would, attract scrutiny from bank regulators. Add a 25 per cent takeover premium and it would surpass the 2007 acquisition of TXU as the largest ever private equity deal.Moreover, video games are traditionally seen as a bad candidate for private equity — like movie studios, they are too dependent on dreaming up and developing new hits. The boom-and-bust cycle means choppy cash flows, unsuitable for paying down large amounts of debt.Yet even if, as seems likely given its vast size, no bid emerges, Activision is otherwise looking like a transformed company — justifying a big increase in valuation.The volatile performance should soon smooth out. Instead of buying hit games such as Call of Duty from a bricks-and-mortar retailer, gamers increasingly opt to download directly, boosting gross margins.Instead of one chunky price, there are now in-game transactions. And most baffling to anyone who grew up fighting with friends for custody of a games controller, there is a generation happy to watch the most talented gamers in so-called “esports”.The size of this latter business is key to Activision’s future. Morgan Stanley’s base case is for $105m in annual revenues from the upcoming launch of a league for Activision’s popular Overwatch game. That would have to be divvied up between the company and professional teams. But the analysts acknowledge this could be a giant underestimate of millennial appetite. In last week’s earnings call chief executive Bobby Kotick compared esports to the National Football League, which he noted makes $12bn of revenue a year.Private equity may not get its mitts on Activision thanks to the gap between valuation and ebitda but that gap is bearable for public investors.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
19;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2017-05-08T17:40:03Z;Esports viewing shoots up but ad revenues have yet to ignite;More than 6bn hours watched in 2016 but fragmented audience slows commercial growth;The amount of time people around the world watch competitive video games as a spectator sport continues to rise at a rapid pace, up 19 per cent last year to more than 6bn hours, according to a new report from analysts at IHS Markit.However, the study suggests it will take several years for professional “esports” to become a sizeable advertising business, given global audience fragmentation.This is pushing the nascent esports industry towards a diversified revenue stream that includes ecommerce and rights sales, in addition to advertising. Esports has seen significant investment in recent years from games publishers and online retailers, including Activision Blizzard, Tencent, Alibaba and Amazon, the latter paying $1bn to acquire video game-streaming site Twitch in 2014. In its report to be published on Tuesday, IHS found that more than half of the global esports audience is in China, accounting for 57 per cent of all viewing in 2016.Games were watched more than 11bn times online in China last year, more than four times as many as in North America, the second-largest market. IHS analysts expect annual esports viewing to exceed 9bn hours by 2021. The biggest esports tournaments, such as the League of Legends world championship, hosted by Tencent-owned Riot Games, and the Dota 2 international, held by US games group Valve, attract multimillion-dollar prize funds, often contributed by fans through crowdfunding campaigns.For esports broadcasters both online and on traditional TV, advertising and sponsorship are the primary drivers of revenues today. Top advertisers include PC equipment makers such as Intel, AMD and Samsung, as well as lifestyle brands including Coca-Cola and Red Bull. As audiences grow, professional gaming is pushing into the sporting mainstream.Last month, the Olympic Council of Asia gave the go-ahead for esports to be a medal event in the 2022 Asia Games in Hangzhou, China. Analysts at Macquarie said in a recent note to clients that the move “may potentially pave the path for esports to gain Olympic status by 2024”. “One of our big priorities is to unlock the full potential of professional esports by opening the sale of teams and media rights of our leagues,” said Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, on a call with investors last week.The publisher of the Call of Duty franchise last year acquired esports network Major League Gaming and plans to launch Overwatch League, based on its game, later this year. It has been meeting with potential team owners in recent months, as part of its bid to “professionalise” esports. “The esports audience includes some of the hardest to reach and most sought-after demographics for marketers and advertisers, with the share of millennials two to three times higher than any of the big four US sports,” Mr Kotick said. In August, Activision will host the CWL Championship in Orlando, where 32 teams will compete in playing Call of Duty for a $1.5m prize pool. Mr Kotick said that esports in the “long term” could reach a “similar scale” to the US National Football League’s annual $12bn in revenues, including $6bn from media rights. However, the industry’s income from advertising remains well short of that target today. [Esports] is definitely still at an early stage, it is unquestionably taking timeIHS estimates that $280m was spent on esports advertising last year, and forecasts that figure to rise to $1bn by 2021. That sum is just a small fraction of the overall digital advertising market, which eMarketer predicts will reach $113bn by the end of the decade. “It is definitely still at an early stage, it is unquestionably taking time,” says Dan Cryan, analyst at IHS and one of the report’s authors. “The audience might be small, but within its demographic, it is overindexing versus traditional sports on TV.” The vast majority of viewing happens on PC and mobile devices, streamed on sites such as Twitch, with traditional TV broadcasts of esports gaining only a small audience share.Despite claims by some esports proponents that its audiences are now as large as traditional sports, IHS found that on a country-by-country basis, viewership remains relatively small. For instance, 7m viewers might watch a big tournament final in the US, compared with 100m for the NFL Super Bowl. In the UK, Ginx, an esports channel backed by Sky and ITV saw its share of the total TV audience peak at just 0.01 per cent in 2016, according to ratings tracker Barb.In the US, esports broadcasts attract audiences numbered in the low hundreds of thousands, rather than the millions that usually attract big-brand advertising. Nonetheless, competitive gaming is succeeding in attracting younger audiences that may be hard to find on other platforms. Says Mr Cryan of IHS: “Demographic changes always take time.”
20;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Activision sales rise 19% with help from mobile unit;;Games publisher Activision Blizzard saw a 19 per cent revenue gain in the first quarter, as sales from its mobile unit King and the popularity of online multiplayer game Overwatch counterbalanced a drop in sales from its console business.First-quarter revenues were $1.7bn, ahead of the company’s guidance. Net income was 17 per cent higher at $426m, with earnings per share up 25 per cent to 57 cents.After disappointing sales of Infinite Warfare, last year’s installment in the Call of Duty franchise, Activision Blizzard said that orders for the next game in the series, set during the World War II, were “off to a very strong start”.Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard’s chief executive, said that previews of Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2 had been “very well received by fans”.Shares in Activision Blizzard, which have rallied by almost 50 per cent in the year to date, were down about 2 per cent to $52.00 after-hours.King, maker of the Candy Crush series of games, saw a 129 per cent increase in net sales for the first quarter year-on-year, while Activision, which publishes Call of Duty, was down 40 per cent over the prior year.Blizzard’s Overwatch is now a “billion-dollar franchise”, the company said, with more than 30m players and a new e-sports league that Mr Kotick hopes could help make his company into the ESPN of competitive video-gaming.Other games publishers are benefiting from a shift to mobile.Zynga, the social-gaming company that also reported earnings on Thursday, saw its shares rise 5 per cent after-hours, thanks to a better-than-expected first quarter. Overall sales were up 4 per cent to $194.3m, compared with Wall Street’s forecasts of $191.5m. Mobile revenues were up 19 per cent year on year, as its audience grew 16 per cent to 18m daily active users on smartphones and tablets. Net losses for the quarter narrowed from $26.6m to $9.5m.Zynga has regained momentum in part thanks to Zynga Poker. However, it will soon face more competition in “social casino” apps from King, which Activision Blizzard said plans to launch a game in the genre through a partnership with PlayStudios.
21;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2017-04-05T04:02:08Z;Nintendo and Sony lead charge as games consoles return to battle;Gaming apps fail to kill off a format that is being reinvented for a new generation;"Some pundits say sales of games consoles peaked with the dotcom boom. However, others believe rumours of their deaths have been greatly exaggerated as new concepts have helped to reinvigorate the format.Sony’s PlayStation 2, released in 2000 at the height of the market, holds the title of best-selling games console, with more than 150m units sold in just over a decade. Vying for the top spot is Nintendo’s handheld DS, which debuted in 2004. Despite two later versions of the PlayStation, and the release of competitors from Nintendo and Microsoft, no other console of the past 20 years has yet come close to either the PS2 or DS. In the meantime, the iPhone has sold 1bn units since its 2007 launch, with consumers now spending tens of billions of dollars a year on games.Piers Harding-Rolls, games analyst at IHS Markit, the research group, forecasts PlayStation 4 sales — at more than 53m since its 2013 release, according to Sony — could top those of the PS2 over its lifetime. He estimates sales will total 119m by 2021.Franchises from Pokémon to Final Fantasy are hopping from console to smartphone and back, with the games industry now able to address a larger audience of paying players thanks as much to puzzle-adventure game Candy Crush Saga as shoot-’em-up Call of Duty. Spending on console, mobile and PC games reached $100bn globally last year, up about $8bn on 2015 according to games intelligence provider Newzoo.No device epitomises that joined-up vision more than Nintendo’s new Switch, a “hybrid” console that combines a portable screen with big-display gaming when plugged into a TV. “The Switch is a complete redefinition of what it means to be a console,” says Mike Gallagher, chief executive of the Entertainment Software Association, the US games industry’s trade group. “The concept is very novel, very exciting and very different . . . It’s a great credit to [Nintendo] that they make this investment and take this risk.”Nintendo has tried to bridge the gap between consoles and tablets before, with the Wii U, launched in 2012, which was a disaster for the Japanese company. This featured a huge controller with an iPad-like touchscreen that has to be within range of a TV-tethered base station to work. It sold 13m units over its lifetime until January, far below the 100m units of its predecessor, the Wii.Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, the chipmaker that produces the Switch’s graphics processor, has said consumers will be “blown away” by the new device. “Nintendo . . . [is] singularly focused on making sure the gaming experience is amazing, surprising and safe for young people,” Mr Huang said at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.His implicit contrast was with smartphones and tablets, whose primary function is communication; games are just one of a phone’s many uses, which limits the opportunities for players. Mr Harding-Rolls says: “Consoles are still unique in providing a curated selection of games, [sophisticated] experiences, plug-and-play technology and are relatively cheap compared to a PC.”The Switch became Nintendo’s fastest-selling console in the US, Europe and Australia during its launch weekend in March. IHS Markit says it will help contribute to a predicted 4.1 per cent growth in the overall console market this year, which will take it to $36.2bn.Last year, however, the console market declined. With price cuts by Sony and Microsoft — and slowing demand for their PS4 and Xbox One consoles — the market fell by 2.5 per cent to $34.7bn in 2016 from the year before, IHS says. That came despite the launch of three much-anticipated virtual-reality headsets: the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR.VR has promised to reinvigorate the games industry by offering immersive experiences that place the player inside the game. So far, however, the market is taking off slowly. While the PS VR has shown early signs of success, thanks to its association with the PS4, the high costs of VR hardware and the powerful PCs required to run the Rift and Vive have deterred consumers.Jason Rubin, head of content at Facebook-owned Oculus, said in an interview at the Game Developers Conference in March that VR needed more content and lower prices to “shift into second gear”. So in March, less than a year after the headset first went on sale, Oculus cut the Rift’s price — and that of its accompanying Touch Controllers, which let players use their hands in virtual worlds — by 25 per cent to $598.To ensure more games are created to attract consumers, Mr Rubin said hardware companies such as Oculus will have to fund software developers upfront. Facebook has said it will invest $500m in VR content. But, for now, smaller independent developers dominate the Oculus game store rather than traditional console publishers such as Activision Blizzard or Electronic Arts, which are waiting to see if the medium takes off.Many in the industry remain optimistic about VR. IDC, the analyst group, predicts total headsets for VR and AR will reach 99.4m units by 2021, with a compound annual growth rate of 58 per cent between now and then.“Will VR get to tens or hundreds of millions of users? I think it will,” says Lisa Su, chief executive of chipmaker AMD, who hopes VR will spur demand for its new range of cheaper, yet powerful, processors. “As the price point becomes more affordable, that’s when the technology takes off.” Mobile app stores remain the biggest draw for games developers looking for a large market and low upfront costs. While the likes of Apple’s App Store has become overcrowded, with a few hits such as Clash of Clans or Pokémon Go scooping up a disproportionate amount of downloads and revenues, new mobile gaming businesses continue to emerge.The revenues of Scopely, a six-year-old mobile games publisher based in Los Angeles, grow eightfold between 2014 and 2016. Walter Driver, its chief executive, says the app market is a “totally different business model to traditional gaming, which was about one-time payments and relies on brand recognition. Now there are 2.5bn apps to try.”He adds: “Many companies started with a hit game but only a handful have done it again and again.” The company’s popular games include WWE Champions, based on the wrestling franchise, and The Walking Dead: Road to Survival, featuring characters from the zombie TV show and comics.“We are living in this arena of a massive ‘mainstreamification’ of gaming,” Mr Driver says. “It used to be a binary category — either you bought a console or you didn’t. Now mobile games appeal to a far broader audience.”That is proving profitable even though smartphone sales have also begun to slow. “A higher percentage of people are spending money on games, and the people who are spending money are spending more,” Mr Driver adds.Mr Harding-Rolls says that Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft will have to move beyond selling discs and into Netflix-style streaming services if console makers are to win over mobile gamers. Sony, for example, is offering the PlayStation Now games subscription service while using its console as a platform to leap into the video streaming market with PlayStation Vue — a package of live TV and movies that competes with US cable offerings. Set-top boxes for watching TV and films, such as Apple TV and Amazon’s Fire TV, are also becoming a means to play games.“The existential question is, what is a console?” asks ESA chief Mr Gallagher. “There are more platforms than ever with high amounts of computing power. We could see even more kinds of consoles than we have now.”"

UBS justified the rise based on strong performance from the competitive team-based first-person shooter Overwatch and more robust content from online action-role playing game Destiny, as well as positive outlook for the company’s Call of Duty series and improved potential of its toys-to-life Skylanders franchise on Nintendo’s new Switch console.It also suggested remaining upside for Activision Blizzard based on ad revenue from its acquisition of King Digital, publisher of the popular Candy Crush puzzle games, as well as growth opportunities in e-sports and a recently announced consumer products division.Wednesday’s closing price of $50.14 brings shares in Activision Blizzard up 39.7 per cent for the year to date, as the stock has enjoyed a sustained rally following a strong fourth-quarter earnings report.Revenues rose 41 per cent during the company’s 2016 financial year, with UBS estimating diluted annual earnings per share of $2.21, up 66 per cent year on year after falling in 2015.
23;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2017-02-10T03:15:46Z;Activision shows fight despite latest Call of Duty difficulties;Shares of video games publisher boosted on strong holiday sales and dividend increase;Shares in Activision Blizzard surged by as much as 11 per cent in after-hours trading, as the video games publisher beat Wall Street’s expectations for holiday sales and announced a new capital return programme.The December quarter saw the launch of the latest instalment of Call of Duty, the 13-year-old shooting-game franchise. While Activision does not reveal sales for the title, this year dubbed Infinite Warfare, the company acknowledged that the game performed poorly due to its outer-space setting, which “did not appeal to all of our fans”.“With any longstanding franchise like Call of Duty, there’s a balancing act we need to strike between staying true to the things that people love about the franchise and also the need to never become complacent and to keep pushing for innovations to keep the franchise fresh and vital,” said Eric Hirshberg, Activision’s chief executive. “Last year, I don’t think we got that balance right.”Activision may have lost this battle to Electronic Arts’ rival first-person shooter Battlefield, but the war continues. Mr Hirshberg promised that 2017’s episode of the series would go “back to its roots” with more “traditional combat”. “We have never been more excited, either creatively or commercially, about our three-year Call of Duty slate,” he said.While Infinite Warfare performed poorly, many players of its predecessor, Black Ops III, are still buying special items and power-ups as they fight online against their friends. In-game purchases more than doubled last year to $3.8bn across the company as a whole.“Call of Duty is still the key pillar to the Activision part of the business,” said Colin Sebastian, analyst at Baird. “What we are seeing develop fairly quickly is that recurring digital revenues and in-game transactions are becoming a much larger part of the mix.”While Call of Duty is still Activision’s best-known brand, Blizzard’s new hit Overwatch more than compensated for the shortfall, with Bobby Kotick, group chief executive, hailing it as a “major new franchise”.Overwatch’s monthly active users during the year were up 37 per cent year-on-year to 36m. That helped drive Blizzard’s revenues up by 50 per cent last year.Total revenues at Activision Blizzard grew 49 per cent in the December quarter to $2.01bn, boosted by its acquisition of Candy Crush Saga maker King Digital. Including deferred revenues, fourth-quarter sales of $2.45bn exceeded analysts’ estimates of $2.38bn. Earnings were up 57 per cent to 33 cents, with net income up 60 per cent to $254m.At the same time, the video games group also unveiled a $1bn share buyback plan and a 15 per cent dividend increase to 30 cents, as well as its slate of releases for 2017. Its shares hit $44.00 in after-hours trading, their highest level since October.Overwatch is a team-based shooting game that taps into the fast-growing trend for esports, which was also credited as driving sales at Nvidia, the maker of graphical processing units for gaming PCs, as well as data centres and autonomous cars.Nvidia, which was the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 last year, has turned sales to gamers into a $5bn-a-year business, based on the last quarter’s revenues. On Thursday, Nvidia reported overall 2016 revenues of $6.9bn, up 38 per cent on the previous year.“PC gaming is growing because of a dynamic nobody expected 20 years ago — how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport,” said Jen-hsun Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, on a call with analysts. “It will soon be the largest sport in the world.”

Including deferred revenues, fourth-quarter sales of $2.45bn exceeded analysts’ estimates of $2.38bn.King has been testing advertising in its games to accompany in-app purchases of power-ups and extra lives, which Mr Kotick said were “very promising as the basis for meaningful new revenue streams”.Overwatch, the latest multiplayer game from Blizzard, proved a hit for the group in 2016, driving monthly active users during the year to 36m, up 37 per cent year-on-year.Activision also confirmed that a sequel to 2014’s first-person shooter Destiny is on track for release later this year.A poor reception to the latest Call of Duty, Infinite Warfare, did not stop a record number monthly active users and in-game revenues from the franchise, in part due to players’ ongoing spending on the previous year’s edition, Black Ops III.Analysts at Baird have estimated that physical and digital sales of Infinite Warfare, which was set in outer space for the first time, declined around 20 per cent year on year. Activision said on Thursday that the next version would go “back to its roots”, suggesting a more traditional warfare simulation.
25;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2016-12-11T10:21:13Z;Activision has a fight on its hands over Call of Duty game sales;Franchise has sold 200m units in 13 years but retail figures are down, say analysts;For gamers, the release of a new Call of Duty title is as familiar a fixture of the holidays as twinkling lights and turkey. The 13-year-old franchise has sold more than 200m units in total, with publisher Activision Blizzard typically pointing to its opening weekend sales — which hit $550m last year — as bigger than anything a Hollywood blockbuster can muster.This year, however, Activision Blizzard has claimed no such triumph. Market researchers and analysts say that sales of Call of Duty’s latest instalment, dubbed Infinite Warfare, have dropped dramatically. In the first month of its release, Infinite Warfare’s unit sales at retail were almost half of the two previous games in the series, Black Ops III and Advanced Warfare, according to the latest figures published by NPD Group.“The debate will now be, is CoD a damaged franchise or was it just a weak game versus a tough competitor?” asks Ben Schachter of Macquarie Securities. “We think a bit of both.”Infinite Warfare is a good analogy for the fierce and frenzied competition for gamers’ dollars this Christmas. Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard’s main rival in console software, released two new “first-person shooter” games, Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, in the past two months, while several other new titles in the same genre, including Gears of War 4 and Watch Dogs 2, have all received good reviews.“The truth is, you have seven games that came out in a six-week period and all but one are good,” says Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Gamers have a lot of choices and it’s caused a logjam. I don’t believe that gamers aren’t interested or are off playing Pokémon Go instead.”While the Pokémon Go phenomenon took tens of millions of console gamers off their sofas this summer and out into the park with their smartphones to hunt its virtual monsters, the app’s popularity actually boosted traditional games sales for Nintendo.More than 10m units of the latest Pokemon games for Nintendo’s 3DS were shipped at launch, the Japanese company that runs the franchise said last month — an increase of more than 150 per cent compared to the previous release in the series and setting a new record for the handheld console. A dilemma for PlayStation and Xbox owners is whether to buy more software for their existing consoles or spend hundreds of dollars to upgrade their hardware. New versions of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have hit the market, offering cheaper prices or more processing power. The new PS4 Pro helped push sales of Sony’s console to more than 50m units since the original PS4 launched in 2013, the Japanese electronics group announced last week. Sony also has its new PlayStation VR headset, for which demand has outstripped supply.“If you’re buying new hardware, you have less money to invest in software,” says Piers Harding-Rolls, games analyst at IHS. “If you’re buying a PS4 Pro, it’s bound to hit your other spending capabilities.”Nonetheless, those people will eventually need to buy more games to play on their new consoles. “Unless you actually believe that people purchase consoles to prop the door open, those people are going to buy software,” says Mr Pachter. “It’s idiotic to conclude that nobody is buying AAA games any more.”In the short term, though, games publishers are feeling the squeeze. Software sales were down 22 per cent in the US in November compared with the previous year, according to NPD’s latest report, with Activision Blizzard down 36 per cent year on year and EA 26 per cent lower.The first inkling that Infinite Warfare was struggling to live up to its predecessors came when Gamestop, the US high-street video games retailer, said during last month’s earnings call that the Activision title had “underperformed our expectations”. Gamestop even tried to encourage sales by offering it for as little as $1 if players traded in certain other games.Unless you actually believe that people purchase consoles to prop the door open, those people are going to buy softwareHowever, some analysts argue that the figures may not be quite as bleak for Activision Blizzard as NPD and Gamestop suggest. Researchers are able to track physical sales much more accurately than digital downloads, which are becoming a more meaningful contributor to new game launches. Downloads are harder to measure because much of the purchasing is done through Sony and Microsoft’s online stores.“It feels like we are reaching more of a tipping point in terms of digital content,” Mr Harding-Rolls says, in particular thanks to launch-day download bundles that include many of the exclusive features that would previously have had fans lining up outside physical stores.Analysts at Cowen and Co interpreted NPD’s figures as implying a drop in Call of Duty unit sales of a third, after accounting for digital sales. Activision Blizzard has been able to compensate for some of the drop in volume by packaging premium-priced editions of the game with extra features for $80.Other titles in the publisher’s portfolio, such as its new hit Overwatch, are also offsetting CoD’s decline. Once gamers buy shooters such as Call of Duty or Battlefield, the appeal of buying new in-game items to compete with friends in online multiplayer battles keeps many playing them for longer, reducing the importance of opening-weekend sales.During a recent conference call with investors and analysts ahead of its release, Eric Hirshberg, Activision’s chief executive, conceded that Infinite Warfare sales may be down on last year’s popular Black Ops III.“Keeping a franchise that’s been on top for as long as Call of Duty has, fresh every year is no easy task,” he said, while adding that its developers now deliver regular digital updates and new styles of play for months after the packaged game hits the shelves.“I think that it is important that we think about Call of Duty as a year-round business,” Mr Hirshberg said.

Equilar’s most recent list, published in May, was led by Expedia’s Dara Khosrowshahi with total compensation of $94.6m, followed by CBS boss Les Moonves with $56.4m.At the same time, Mr Kotick’s base salary will be reduced from $2.37m in 2016 to $1.75m next year. A further $3.5m will be available as an annual bonus, based on 200 per cent of the salary, if he meets certain targets. Further incentive grants will be paid in 2020 as long as Mr Kotick delivers annualised total shareholder return of at least 6 per cent, or if he makes a “transformative transaction” in that time.Mr Kotick has led Activision Blizzard for more than 25 years. America’s most valuable video games company, the company recently released the latest instalment in its popular Call of Duty series, Infinite Warfare.Earlier this month, the California-based company reported third-quarter revenues up 58 per cent to $1.57bn. The year-over-year growth rate was accelerated by the acquisition of mobile games company King, which closed in February, and by a strong performance from Blizzard games such as World of Warcraft: Legion and Overwatch.
27;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2016-11-04T18:30:17Z;‘Overwatch’ heading for the big esports league;Activision Blizzard seeks investors to buy into team franchises based on video game;Activision Blizzard is launching its first esports league around its popular Overwatch game, as it looks to recreate the multibillion-dollar franchises and highly paid players of traditional US sports such as NFL football and NBA basketball.The move is an attempt to professionalise the fast-growing industry of competitive videogaming, which has gone from niche hobby to mass-market entertainment in the last few years. Activision’s approach is designed to introduce regular salaries for top players, increase prize money and attract new sponsors.Overwatch, a team-based shooting game for PCs and consoles, was launched in May to tap into the esports phenomenon, by making it spectator friendly and easy to organise tournaments. It has attracted 20m players, creating what analysts see as a real rival to established competitive games such as League of Legends and Dota 2.“We now have enough momentum, enough of a player base that we can roll out competitive gaming in a different way,” said Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive, in an interview. “Nobody else has been producing super high-quality content consistently in a season . . . If we are going to elevate players as professionals, mentors and potential role models, there needs to be this professional league.”As retail sales from traditional games shift online, publishers have been looking for new sources of revenue, from in-game digital upgrades to entertainment spin-offs such as films and TV shows. Esports is seen as one of the most lucrative of those new opportunities.Research group IHS forecasts esports viewing hours will grow from 6.1bn this year to almost 9bn by 2020, after growing by almost 750 per cent in the last four years.Attracted by an audience that is starting to rival traditional sports in size and engagement, Activision is hoping that new investors will buy into the team franchises that it will create around the Overwatch League. Revenues from broadcasting, event tickets and merchandise will be split between team owners and the publisher.Nobody else has been producing super high-quality content consistently in a season . . . If we are going to elevate players as professionals, mentors and potential role models, there needs to be this professional leagueDozens of investors from existing football and baseball team owners as well as entrepreneurs already involved in esports were expected to gather at Blizzcon, a fan event held every year at the Anaheim Convention Centre in California, to hear Activision’s pitch.The games company is likely to compare Overwatch’s 20m players to the NFL’s 66m regular fans, who between ticket sales, broadcast rights and merchandising make American football a $13bn a year enterprise.“The approach first and foremost is to make sure we have the right owners with the right capital commitments to reward and celebrate our players,” Mr Kotick said.The first Overwatch League season will begin next year, starting with a “combine” where gamers can try out to join a team. Players who are recruited by a team will be guaranteed a basic minimum salary and benefits package. Each franchise will be associated with a major city around the world, giving fans a local team to rally behind and a stadium venue to watch big games.“Our expectation is that we will have teams throughout the world competing against each other in their local markets,” Mr Kotick said. The idea is to make players into “local heroes” akin to traditional athletes today, while also bringing investors “great financial returns over time”, he said.Activision, which is the world’s largest video games company by market capitalisation, launched its esports division a year ago and then acquired Major League Gaming, which broadcasts competitive gaming, in January for a reported $46m. That deal followed Amazon’s $1bn purchase of Twitch, one of the most popular online sites to broadcast and watch live videogaming, in 2014.20mNumber of ‘Overwatch’ players, which was launched in MayPiers Harding-Rolls, analyst at IHS, said Activision was a “key player” in competitive gaming but its attempt to create the “ESPN of esports” would bring new challenges. Most competitive teams are owned and operated independently of publishers’ tournaments, he said, making Activision’s move to build their own franchises “a departure”.“The number of professional teams run into the hundreds and a vast majority of winnings are centred on these professional teams rather than amateurs,” Mr Harding-Rolls said. While more games now have significant prize money associated with tournaments, winnings “drop off quite quickly” beyond the top teams.“Competitive gaming is very popular with a broad section of gamers, but most don't enter tournaments,” he said. “A hook based on a specific city could add impetus to intra-country competitions and would obviously align more strongly with established sports but I think it would take time to have an impact in a market such as the US.” City-based competitions are more established in China, he added.Activision on Thursday reported a 58 per cent rise in third-quarter revenues to $1.57bn, with net income 56 per cent higher at $199m, beating Wall Street’s expectations. Although it increased its outlook for the holiday quarter to $1.86bn, its shares fell about 4 per cent on Friday after it cut its earnings guidance by a cent to 5 cents per share.

The company forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 5 cents per share on a GAAP basis, which was also below the 22 cents per share expected by Wall Street.In the third quarter, Activision Blizzard logged adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents compared to 39 cents a year earlier, beating Wall Street expectations of 42 cents per share. Revenue came in at $1.57bn, a big jump from $990m a year earlier but in line with expectations.
29;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2016-08-02T12:58:51Z;Meet Chris Puckett — taking video gaming from bedroom to stadium;The commentator performs at live gaming events all over the world;"Chris Puckett, from Columbus, Ohio, has the all-American boyish looks of a Norman Rockwell painting.The 30-year-old’s wholesome appearance is important. It underpins his employer’s attempts to sell a burgeoning industry, often dismissed as the preserve of bedroom-lurking nerds: electronic sports (esports) — or competitive computer gaming.The former Halo gamer, who as a teen played the Microsoft game for prize money, is a presenter broadcasting to viewers following esport tournaments livestreamed on smartphones or computers — but also to the thousands of people who come to watch gaming events in stadiums all over the world.The ultimate aim is for esports to be as big as basketball or football. In 2015, the global audience for esports was 188m viewers, according to Superdata, a market research company. It predicts that number will grow to 303m by 2019. Revenues are forecast to reach $893m this year through advertising, ticket sales, sponsorship and merchandising.Mr Puckett is frequently stopped by gaming enthusiasts wanting him to sign their mousemats (esports being the last refuge of the mousemat, helping players’ comfort and precision).He is employed by Activision Blizzard Media Networks, a dedicated esports division of game publisher Activision Blizzard, with the mission to broaden esports’ appeal. Mike Sepso, senior vice-president, sees potential for growth in western Europe and North America.“They’re the markets that have lagged behind the Asian markets in terms of competitors and viewers,” says Mr Sepso.Activision Blizzard joined forces with Facebook last month to deliver live coverage of the Major League Gaming Anaheim Open — a two-day tournament for players of Call of Duty. The event was streamed over the social media site and included additional content presented by Mr Puckett, such as highlights, statistics, interviews, and commentary.Video-game companies, players, esports organisers and broadcasters want esports’ profile to grow into a widespread spectator sport. In August, for example, a two-day international event will be held in Rio de Janeiro alongside the Olympics and organised by the new International eGames Committee.The sport has even had its own drug scandal — in this case it was not steroids but Adderall, a drug used by students to help them focus in exams.In tournaments, players may game for up to 12 hours a day. Knock-out tournaments can be held over a weekend or over several weeks.This year, ESPN and Yahoo launched dedicated esports channels on their websites. There is widespread online streaming of games on dedicated sites such as Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.Mr Puckett is part of Activision Blizzard’s strategy to make esports appealing to a broad audience. His energy and enthusiasm is infectious — even to someone, like me, who feels 105 years old when talking to him — and he is bound to win over parents worried about their children spending too much time playing video games or watching esports.He has also guest-hosted on TBS, the satellite and cable channel owned by the Turner Broadcasting System division of Time Warner, another sign that established media organisations are trying to capture gaming enthusiasts.Not only is Mr Puckett a host but he also continues to “shoutcast” — analyse play by play, much like a football commentator. He is the “hype man”, hanging out with fans, getting the audience involved, interviewing the pro players. “I wear all the hats in production, behind the scenes and in front of the camera as well,” he says.Mr Sepso says of his employee: “He can connect with the [core] audience [because] he’s of their demographic, and of their mindset and he’s been one of the few that has also been able to resonate with the broader audience.”On Mr Puckett’s part, he not only analyses his presentation style but says it is essential to be well-versed in first-person “shooter” games, such as Call of Duty, Counterstrike and the new title, Overwatch.As a child Mr Puckett was a fan of video games. “I wasn’t the best at sports but I was always better than my older brother at video games, so that’s really what got me into it.”When Microsoft launched the Xbox in 2001, the 15-year-old Mr Puckett picked one up and held a big party at his family home. After that, his friends would come to his house every weekend and play.“Eventually we figured out we were pretty good and people in the next town wanted to challenge us and we would drive around and play other people.” They would travel anywhere within an eight-hour drive, and play for a small wager. It was, he reflects, like being a “pool shark”.Soon he was making more money from competing in video games competitions than working in his part-time pizza restaurant job. His father, a paper salesman, and mother, a receptionist at the local church, were baffled. In order to educate them, he invited his father to games who eventually acted as a referee, despite having to ask the players who had won.While studying marketing at university, Mr Puckett began helping to run tournaments for Major League Gaming, the esports company, founded by Mr Sepso and his partner, Sundance DiGiovanni. (It was later acquired by Activision Blizzard).They offered him a job as promotions manager in New York when he was 19. His parents were furious, but he was determined, so in 2004 his mother drove him from Ohio to New York and dropped him off. “I didn’t realise how painful that must have been for her. I was just, like, ‘I’m not going to live in your house. I’m going to go do this.’”He ditched the degree, he says, because he was learning more from esports than at university and he wanted to win over a casual audience, rather than just the obsessives.Times have changed considerably since he was hustling in amateur tournaments, he says. His parents have become his business managers, overseeing endorsements in an industry where players compete for millions of dollars. “They [have] become a little family industry.”By contrast, $574 was the largest sum of prize money Mr Puckett ever won in a single event.Today, teams of competitors even have physical training and a performance coach on leadership. “It’s pretty awesome to see the sports psychology coming into gaming,” he says.The stereotype of esports players as bedroom-dwelling nerds is wrong, he insists.“I spent most of my time with my friends probably on Xbox Live when I was in high school. I would see my friends at class but then after class, we’d be playing together and we continue those conversations.” It can be a social activity. “I have real-life friends all over the planet now that I get to see [who] I’ve met through gaming and it’s really cool to go meet them and see their face for the first time.”Today, his parents are proud of his pioneering. “[My parents] are able to break it down to their church friends or golf buddies. A lot of times they’ll just say I’m the Al Michaels or the Chris Berman [US sports commentators] of video games.”For most sports players turned presenters, the time to leave the pitch or court is obvious: they become less speedy, their muscle tone softens, reactions slow. To some extent this was the case for Mr Puckett too.“There’s a time where you don’t have as much fun as you used to playing, and when you find yourself struggling to put in that time of practice and you don’t see improvements.”emma.jacobs@ft.com

You can sign up here.Three years after Vivendi effectively got out of the non-core business of video games by selling down its stake in Activision Blizzard, the media conglomerate is back in the game again with a move on France’s Ubisoft. Adam Thomson in Paris reports Vivendi has amassed a 17.7 per cent stake in the publisher, with its chief Vincent Bolloré saying it is considering asking for a board reshuffle that gives representation to its increased holding.The move is not welcomed by Ubisoft or analysts, who see it muscling in on a market it has misjudged already: Activision Blizzard has gone from strength to strength since the stake sale and Ubisoft’s hit factory, Massive Entertainment, was sold by Vivendi to Ubisoft back in 2008. Massive is responsible for Tom Clancy’s The Division , Ubisoft’s latest game and the fastest-selling in history: in the first week following release, the company says it generated $330m in retail sales, surpassing Activision Blizzard’sDestiny as the world’s best-selling new franchise.As a poor judge of the potential of first-person shooters, Vivendi should think twice before trying to call the shots at Ubisoft.Swift action The head of Swift is unveiling measures today to combat a wave of recent cyber thefts at members of the global bank payment messaging network.

31;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2016-05-23T15:47:31Z;Ubisoft builds defences to fight off Vivendi;Gaming company worried about group’s record in the industry;It is winter in New York and a deadly virus has ravaged the population, turning Manhattan into a lawless zone of gun-wielding marauders hell-bent on survival. It is your mission to save the city and re-establish order.So goes the plot of Tom Clancy’s The Division, the latest video game from French gaming group Ubisoft. Players run, roll, duck and shoot their way across a freezing wasteland on a mission that takes them through hyper-real renderings of Manhattan — from the lavish interiors of an diplomatic consulate to rat-infested subway service tunnels.All of that has turned The Division, made by Ubisoft’s Sweden-based developer Massive Entertainment, into the fastest-selling video game in history: in the first week following release, the company says it generated $330m in retail sales, surpassing Activision Blizzard’s Destiny as the world’s best-selling new franchise.But the game has given Ubisoft an additional reason to smile: the company headed by Yves Guillemot bought Massive from Vivendi, the very same French media and content group that is now pushing on Ubisoft’s door as it looks for a piece of the action in the gaming industry.Since last October, Vivendi, which is on a mission of its own to become a media force across southern Europe, has amassed a 17.7 per cent stake in the gaming company.Increasing the pressure, the Paris-based group headed by French industrialist Vincent Bolloré said last month that it was even considering “asking for the reshuffling of Ubisoft’s board of directors with the aim, notably, to obtain a representation consistent with its weight as a shareholder”.The Guillemot family holds 8.7 per cent of Ubisoft shares and just over 15 per cent of the voting rights. The family also dominates the board, occupying five of its nine seats.For now, Vivendi, which owns Universal Music Group (UMG) and the Canal Plus pay-television unit and holds a 24.9 per cent stake in Telecom Italia, has said that it does not plan a takeover of Ubisoft. But the gaming group is trying to put in place a defence strategy.Meanwhile, Vivendi has already made an unsolicited offer for Gameloft, the French gaming company headed by Mr Guillemot’s brother.Vivendi’s disposal of Massive in 2008 would seem tailor-made for Ubisoft’s principal argument against its advances: the Paris-based group should stay away from industries it does not understand.In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this year, Mr Guillemot laid out his concerns about Vivendi’s apparent determination to get more control of Ubisoft.“Many companies impose big external bosses who demand blind execution but we are in a creative industry, and creativity relies on letting people take risks,” he said. “Having a group come in that does not understand the industry and just wants to control us will very quickly kill that creativity.”Mr Guillemot is particularly concerned about Mr Bolloré’s record of creeping control, in which he tightens his grip on a company even though he only owns a small percentage of the shares.In 2004, Mr Bolloré bought 5 per cent of Havas, the advertising group. Within months, and in spite of promises that he would not increase his holding, he became the largest shareholder, snatched several board seats, kicked out the president and took control.At Vivendi, Mr Bolloré has amassed considerable control with less than 15 per cent of the shares.David Polfeldt, Massive’s managing director, says that Vivendi’s decision to sell the company in 2008 came as the French group turned its attention to Santa Monica to work more closely with Activision Blizzard, the California video-games company in which it had acquired a controlling stake.“We basically got a phone call from Santa Monica saying ‘You have four weeks to find a buyer for yourselves or we are going to shut you down’,” Mr Polfeldt says. “We thought, ‘Four weeks? Wow’.”He says that under Ubisoft’s ownership, Massive was able to cast off its former reputation as only being capable of producing games for PCs — and ones based on so-called real-time strategy (RTS), a niche genre.“Nobody else was able to see beyond the typecasting,” he says. “We were a small studio but the difference is that Ubisoft was interested in nurturing talent.”With annual sales of €1.4bn in its latest fiscal year and operating profits of €169m, Ubisoft, which was founded in 1986, has more than 10,000 employees and studios stretching from Sofia to San Francisco.It insists that developing successful games — it also produces the best-selling Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Rayman — rests on the delicate and subtle process of getting different studios with very different skills to work together, dividing up the immense work that goes into the final product.Vivendi has little patience for Ubisoft’s thinking. Under the firm grip of Mr Bolloré, Vivendi’s biggest shareholder even though he holds less than 15 per cent of the shares, the group has begun to spend its roughly €15bn cash pile following a two-year asset sale that, among other things, saw it exit the video-games industry as it sold its majority stake in Activision Blizzard. It sold most of its majority stake in 2013 for $13.60 a share. Today, Activision shares are trading at $37.53.It has used money to buy video-hosting site Dailymotion, several film and television production companies in Spain and the UK, a €3bn, 24.9 per cent stake in Telecom Italia and, most recently, a 3.5 per cent stake in Italian broadcaster Mediaset.In its quest to be a dominant southern European force in media and content, it now believes that having video-gaming assets is essential.As it said recently of Gameloft and Ubisoft: “These investments are part of a strategic vision of operational convergence between Vivendi’s content and platforms on one hand and the Ubisoft and Gameloft productions in video games on the other.”For good measure, Arnaud de Puyfontaine, Vivendi’s chief executive, has an additional message for Mr Guillemot. He told the FT: “He should take some time to understand what Vivendi stands for and then he will acknowledge for sure, because he is a very smart guy, that his point is irrelevant . . . don’t consider that the current team is accountable for what happened in the past.”Game on.
32;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2016-05-06T17:11:42Z;Activision bolstered by strong sales;Shares of video game company have risen more than 50% over past 12 months;Activision Blizzard shares jumped on Friday after the video game company unveiled stronger-than-expected quarterly results, helped by its purchase of Candy Crush maker King Digital.The studio behind popular franchises, like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, closed its buyout of King in February, as it looks to tap into growth in mobile gaming.The strategy paid-off in the first quarter, with adjusted digital sales zipping higher by 48 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $797m, accounting for 88 per cent of adjusted revenues, from 76 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. That compares with a 45 per cent drop in sales at retail outlets.Overall net profits fell to $336m in the first quarter, from $394m in the same three-month period in 2015. Management pinned the fall on “purchase price accounting” related to the King buyout.Adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, of 23 cents a share easily beat Wall Street estimates of 12 cents. Meanwhile, the California-based group projected current-quarter adjusted earnings per share at 38 cents, four cents above analysts’ forecasts.“This was a strong start to [2016] . . . and we expect this positive fundamental momentum to continue,” said Drew Crum, an analyst at Stifel.Activision’s shares jumped 5.8 per cent to $36.96 on Friday, bringing their 12-month rise to 51.4 per cent.Elsewhere, Yelp shares surged 18 per cent to $25.35 after the online review site reported better than expected first-quarter results on the back of strong local advertising revenue growth.Adjusting for one-time items, the San-Francisco based company said it earned 8 cents a share, eclipsing analysts’ forecasts for 2 cents. However its net loss widened to $15.5m or 20 cents a share in the first three months of the year, compared with a loss of $1.3m or 2 cents a share in the year ago period.Sales rose 34 per cent to $158.6m, topping estimates, aided by a 40 per cent year-on-year gain in local advertising revenue growth.“Yelp reported a solid quarter driven by local [advertising] where revenue growth accelerated on better than expected ad budget fulfilment and above average salesperson productivity,” said Brian Fitzgerald, analyst at Jefferies.The company previously said that it would focus its sales force on getting ads from local businesses, instead of looking for large brand advertising accounts.Shares in GoPro fell 4.5 per cent to $10.23, after the action camera maker swung to a loss in the first quarter and said it was delaying the launch of its drone camera.The California-based company reported a loss of $107.5m or 78 cents a share in the three months ended in March, compared with a profit of $16.8m or 11 cents a share in the year ago period. Sales fell nearly 50 per cent to $183m. Analysts were looking for a loss of 71 cents a share, on sales of $169m.GoPro also said it was delaying the launch of its drone camera, dubbed Karma, until later this year, though chief executive Nicholas Woodman said “the upside is that Karma’s launch should now benefit from the holidays”.In midday trading, the S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 2,047.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed at 17,660 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.3 per cent to 4,701.5.
33;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2016-04-29T15:19:15Z;Console games makers defy predictions of doom;Analysts forecast a ‘golden era’ for console makers and the publishers who develop games for them;When Microsoft launched the Xbox 360 gaming console in 2005, Nokia controlled almost a third of the mobile phone market and the latest innovation was a device with a front-facing camera.By the time the next Xbox arrived eight years later, Apple had released seven generations of the iPhone and five iPads, and Nokia had just sold Microsoft its struggling mobile business.In the fast-changing technology world, many assumed that consoles like the Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation— and the companies that develop games for them — would soon face game over.But as the industry goes into its earning season next week, some within the sector and the analysts who cover it are bullish about its future. The head of Sony’s gaming division and some analysts have forecast a “golden era” for console makers and the publishers who develop games for them. One reason for their enthusiasm: top publishers have seen their shares more than double in the past three years, and gain more than $20bn in market value since the start of 2015.Shares in the big four western publishers — Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft and Take-Two — have all increased by between 18 and 70 per cent since the start of 2015. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the wider S&P 500 both declined in the same period.In Japan, shares in the four companies that focus on console games — Square Enix, Capcom, Konami and Koei-Tecmo — increased by between 13 and 55 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 declined by 4.5 per cent in the same period. Nintendo develops games for its own consoles and its Wii U has struggled compared to the PS4 and Xbox One, but despite difficulties even its shares have increased 20 per cent since the start of 2015.The major games publishers are following the approach of the big six Hollywood studios by focusing on a small numbers of big-budget blockbusters, and exploiting them to build a similar scale of market dominance. They even share the common criticism that they have become too reliant on sequels. According to NPD Group, the market research company, 10 companies account for almost 90 per cent of physical game sales in the US, with the big four western publishers accounting for more than half of the total.Doug Creutz, senior analyst at Cowen and Company, says “people who thought these companies were going to get replaced were probably people who never played video games”.“People focus on hardware way too much — it’s a content business, not a technology business,” he continues. “You can’t put Grand Theft Auto V on an iPhone, it’s not the same experience. People were thinking about them like software companies when they should look at them like television and movies.”The positivity contrasts with years of warnings and fear that the industry had entered permanent decline set against rapid growth in the mobile games market. The number of publishers capable of developing so-called “triple-A” games — those with the highest production values and budgets — has fallen from a peak of about 80 to between 10 and 15, according to Yoshio Osaki, president of IDG Consulting, a specialist games consultancy.Experienced publishers such as THQ and Midway, creator of the Mortal Kombat series and the fourth-biggest publisher by sales in 2000, collapsed as sales declined. Other groups moved to focus on smaller mobile titles.Alain Martinez is chief financial officer of Ubisoft, a Paris-based gaming group that is being courted by media group Vivendi, which increased its stake in the company to more than 17 per cent and asked for a board seat on Friday.Mr Martinez said the long gap between new consoles led output to grow “a little stale”. He admits that “people had serious doubts about the future of high-end games”.Since the release of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2013, however, sales have rebounded, with combined PS4 and Xbox sales almost 50 per cent higher than the previous console cycle. This week Sony announced that the PS4’s success had helped the company to its first full-year net profit in three years.In a presentation to analysts on Thursday, Sony said it expects the console’s strong momentum to continue, and its success has translated into higher revenues for games publishers. Global revenues from console games are forecast to reach $28bn for the first time since 2010 this year, according to PwC, the professional services firm.Consolidation means the remaining companies are enjoying a bigger share of those revenues, while new technology has helped them to significantly improve margins. Selling games as direct downloads to customers’ consoles has allowed publishers to avoid paying a slice of revenue to retailers, and many have established entirely new divisions to track customers and generate extra money from old games.Industry figures described their old business model as “fire and forget”: a game would be released, a customer would buy a cartridge or disc, and publishers would move on to developing the next one. Now, Mr Martinez says, “we have a precise knowledge of what and how and with whom customers play, we have a much better context for communicating with them”. As well as fixing problems after release, publishers increasingly sell additional content such as new levels, playable characters or game modes that are much cheaper to produce than a whole new game.“We’ve gone from being like a Ford Model T, where every car has the same colour, to being more like a Jaguar or Mercedes, who can offer extra options and make more on those than on the base car,” says Mr Martinez.Publishers adapted such micropayment methods from the mobile and social games that some had thought would threaten their business model. They also expanded directly into new markets with their own mobile games. Activision Blizzard, the largest gaming company in the US, paid $5.9bn for Candy Crush developer King Digital, while shares in Nintendo surged last month after the unexpected success of its first mobile app.However, the discount price paid for King — Activision’s $18 per share takeover was 20 per cent lower than the price at King’s 2014 initial public offering — also highlights one of the factors that have drawn investors back to consoles.In contrast to the unpredictable mobile market, the reliable revenues of “triple-A” franchises such as Call of Duty and Assassin’s Creed, and the high barriers to entry for any would-be competitors, have made big developers more appealing to investors.Mobile games are much cheaper to produce, making it easier for new competitors to emerge, and mainly target “casual” gamers, who are less likely to be loyal to a particular series.Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho, says “it’s very hard to build a business around casual gamers. A lot of investors got burnt on companies like Zynga because as soon as interest waned revenue and margins collapsed. People felt these businesses may not be sustainable as investment idea.”Mr Doshi adds, however, that the console market “is starting to feel saturated”, and Activision, EA and Ubisoft have all disappointed investors with recent sales figures or targets. The PS4 and Xbox One’s success has relied on hardcore, committed gamers, and Mr Osaki believes console makers and games developers will soon have to provide more mass market offerings to achieve further growth.Ubisoft’s Mr Martinez says there is still capacity for growth and said new markets such as Latin America and eastern Europe are growing even if sales in mature markets such as the US remain fairly flat.If the remaining triple-A developers benefit from operating like Hollywood film studios, however, they also face the same challenges. In 2015, 54 per cent of EA’s revenues came from just three franchises, while Take-Two is even more reliant on its Grand Theft Auto series. Production delays or a few flops could cause serious damage.“It’s a creative business, and I don’t know any publisher that hasn’t postponed a game at one point,” Mr Martinez adds. “The fans are very experienced and demanding, so we need to ensure we deliver.”At its peak in 2012, social games company Zynga was valued at more than seven times higher than fellow US games company Take-Two. Today, the roles have switched: Take-Two’s market capitalisation is about 40 per cent higher than the FarmVille creator.The focus on FarmVille highlights Zynga’s big difficulty: its most well-known game is seven years old, and the company has struggled to replicate a similar level of success. Zynga’s shares have fallen 83 per cent from their post-IPO peak in 2012, and it has not posted a full-year profit since 2010.Casual gaming has not gone away in that time — it is forecast to be worth more than $22bn in annual revenues by 2019, according to PwC. The problem is that few companies have been able to achieve repeat success, making investors increasingly wary.Yoshio Osaki, president of IDG Consulting, says “just because mobile is growing faster doesn’t mean it’s easier to be successful”.The most popular mobile games rely on a “freemium” model, through which only a small percentage of users pay to speed up play or boost their abilities. So publishers need to reach huge numbers of users to make profits.Helsinki-based Supercell has succeeded by focusing on a small number of titles — Clash Royale, released earlier this year, was only its fourth game — but the sheer volume of mobile games makes it difficult for many to capture gamers’ attention.Five hundred new games enter app stores every day, and analysts at Goldman Sachs suggest console developers’ recognisable brands will help their expansions into mobile stand out, offering a chance for further growth rather than threatening their revenues.“There used to be maybe 80 developers that could make a big triple-A console title, now there are 10 to 15,” says Mr Osaki. “On mobile you’re competing with tens of thousands.”
34;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2016-02-11T23:17:06Z;‘Destiny’ deals a tough hand for Activision Blizzard;Fewer players at acquisition target King Digital add to gamemaker’s woes;Activision Blizzard’s investors took fright at a delay to a new instalment of its hit action game Destiny, a sharp drop in profits and fewer players at its $5.9bn acquisition target, Candy Crush developer King Digital.Activision’s shares fell by as much as 20 per cent after-hours on Thursday after both it and King posted their quarterly results, although the decline later moderated to 12 per cent.Despite reporting strong sales of the latest episode of Call of Duty, “lower than expected” sales of its Skylanders range of toys and games meant Activision’s net revenues fell by 14 per cent to $1.35bn in the holiday quarter. While games sales increased on “next generation” consoles such as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, revenues from older consoles such as PS3 and Nintendo’s Wii fell faster than expected. Earnings per share more than halved to 21 cents in the quarter.Activision also warned that a sequel to Destiny, one of its newest console franchises that was launched in 2014, was now delayed to 2017. An expansion pack for the current game will arrive later this year instead, but the delay will cut 15 cents from its earnings guidance for the year, which is now $1.75, including the expected contribution from King, on a non-GAAP basis.Even though King’s earnings and revenues were ahead of Wall Street expectations, the mobile games maker said that monthly active users fell by 16 per cent in the fourth quarter, to 449m, as newer games failed to attract enough new players to offset the decline in the original Candy Crush Saga’s audience.The portion of those players who spent money on in-game upgrades fell even faster, down 21 per cent to 6.6m. As a result, total revenues fell by 15.6 per cent to $461m in the fourth quarter, with pre-tax profit down by 35.6 per cent to $131.5m.Activision’s acquisition of King, announced in November, is expected to close by the end of February, pending regulatory approval.“With our expected closing of the acquisition of King Digital later this month, we will have the largest game network in the world, with over 500m users playing our games every month,” said Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard chief executive. Combined revenues from the two businesses are expected to reach $6.25bn this year, he said.
35;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2016-01-15T12:35:23Z;Vivendi sells stake in gaming company Activision Blizzard;Vincent Bolloré’s media group offloads shares for $1.1bn as it continues to rethink approach;Vivendi has sold its 5.7 per cent stake in Activision Blizzard for $1.1bn, completing the French media group’s exit from the California-based gaming company more than two years after it reduced its then-majority stake.The French company said on Friday that it made the move “in view of the evolution of the Activision Blizzard stock price”, which has increased 87 per cent in the past year.It added that it sold the stake to a financial institution, though it withheld the name. It also said that it had unwound a hedge that it had on its Activision stake, allowing it to take back a $400m cash deposit.Vivendi’s original decision to reduce its stake in Activision, whose games include Call of Duty and Skylanders, came as part of a wider shift to focus on its Canal Plus television business and Universal Music Group. Vivendi has set a goal of building a European media powerhouse around these two remaining pillars.Other asset sales included exiting telecoms with the sale of Maroc Telecom and SFR, France’s second-biggest mobile operator. Most recently, it sold GVT, its Brazilian unit.Yet under the leadership of Vincent Bolloré, Vivendi has started to re-evaluate its option. Late last year, it began to buy shares in Telecom Italia, and is now the company’s biggest shareholder with a stake of just over 20 per cent.In December, Mr Bolloré used that clout to push for four board seats at the Italian company. He also successfully blocked a proposed stock conversion, which would have diluted Vivendi’s stake.The media group has also used its huge cash pile from its assets sale — as of September last year, it had a net cash position of €8bn — to buy stakes in French gaming companies Ubisoft, which owns the Assassin’s Creed title, and Gameloft.The group recently said that it did not rule out a takeover of Gameloft in the coming months.Both companies, which were founded by France’s Guillemot brothers, have voiced their displeasure with Mr Bolloré’s latest move, and reiterated their determination to remain independent.
36;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2016-01-13T13:09:49Z;Activision hires Hollywood producer behind Tarantino films;Gaming company hopes Stacey Sher can help turn games such as Skylanders into film and TV series;Activision Blizzard has hired the Hollywood producer behind movies including Quentin Tarantino’s latest, The Hateful Eight, to bolster its efforts to turn video games such as Skylanders and Call of Duty into films and television series.Bobby Kotick, the gaming company’s chief executive, launched Activision Blizzard Studios late last year soon after announcing the $5.9bn acquisition of Candy Crush maker King Digital. Alongside a renewed push into competitive gaming and esports, making use of Activision’s blockbuster franchises in other entertainment formats is part of Mr Kotick’s efforts to diversify the company.His latest recruit, Stacey Sher, has more than 20 years of experience in Hollywood, working with directors such as Oliver Stone, Steven Soderbergh and Terry Gilliam. Her film credits include Erin Brockovich, Django Unchained and Gattaca, as well as Comedy Central TV show Reno 911.Ms Sher joins Activision Blizzard Studios as co-president, and will work alongside Nick van Dyk, a former Walt Disney executive who worked on the acquisitions of animation company Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm.Activision’s push into the market comes ahead of a big year for videogaming franchises at the cinema, with titles including Angry Birds, Assassin’s Creed and Blizzard’s own Warcraft slated for release during 2016.Mr Kotick hopes that Activision can take advantage of the tens of millions of loyal players who return year after year for franchises such as Call of Duty.But een the most popular video games have a mixed record when it comes to transferring on to the big screen. In the 1990s, Super Mario Bros and Street Fighter II, which had been hugely successful games, flopped at the box office. However, some movies that were panned by critics, such as 2001’s Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and the Resident Evil series, have proven to be financial successes.After producing films including 1994’s Pulp Fiction, Ms Sher brings creative credibility to the project.“Her ability to collaborate with the most inspired, talented people in entertainment and her unyielding commitment to creativity make her perfectly suited to Activision Blizzard Studios,” Mr Kotick said.Ms Sher said that Activision’s “commitment to quality” made her confident that the studio could shake off the legacy of underwhelming gaming movies.“The films I’ve made, no matter what genre or audience, have tried to be really singular,” she said. “I have had a small boutique production company for years and I understand that when you are smaller, oftentimes you can get more done.”Mr Tarantino said “she has been an amazing collaborator on the three films we made together”.Analysts said the move reflected the growing importance of gaming to the wider entertainment industry, with video games sales far exceeding movie box office receipts in recent years.“Games properties and franchises are now powerful broader entertainment and licensing opportunities, which reduces the risk of this type of diversification strategy,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at IHS, a consultancy. “Activision’s track record of building billion-dollar entertainment franchises suggests it is better positioned than many of its competitors to make this transition a success.”Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles said that Ms Sher was “supremely talented” but questioned whether Activision’s franchises had strong enough storylines to carry a feature film. “Movies are only interesting if they tell a good story, and it isn’t clear to me that there is all that much to any of Blizzard’s properties, and certainly not anything compelling in Call of Duty,” he said. “I do think that a Skylanders TV show could do well.”The first output from the studios this year is expected to be a TV animation programme based on the “games to life” franchise Skylanders, where a wide range of plastic figures connect to in-game characters.Mr van Dyk believes that Activision Blizzard can be more efficient in film production than traditional Hollywood studios, thanks to its existing franchises and easily identifiable potential audience.“We start with a blank piece of paper looking at how people enjoy entertainment today,” he said. “We are going to have a much smaller, leaner, more efficient organisation. It’s an entirely different ball game than just getting into the film and TV business.”The new hire follows the company’s acquisition last week of Major League Gaming, which organises tournaments based on titles such as Call of Duty. Esports has become a multimillion-dollar business in recent years as tens of millions of players watch competitive gaming both online, through sites such as Amazon’s Twitch, and in the real world, with events held at sports arenas around the world. Activision reportedly paid $46m for MLG, which helped to pioneer the market.At an investor day last November, Activision said it planned to broaden its reach to new players and deepen engagement among existing gamers, with esports, films and TV central to that strategy.
37;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2015-12-06T18:05:06Z;Sony banks on record sales of PlayStation 4 to drive turnround;Console expected to exceed PS2 on back of exclusive deals with leading gaming companies;"The popularity of the PlayStation 4 is bolstering Sony’s long-term confidence for its flagship games console, after sales topped 30m units last month.The PS4 has become the fastest-selling home console ever, exceeding the early performance of the PlayStation 2 which went on to sell more units than any other console over its 12-year life.Andrew House, president and global chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment, said this weekend that he expected the PS4 to match or outpace the PS2’s sales in its first three to five years.“We’ve just seen the most successful Black Friday in the company’s history,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We are now trying to benchmark against the success of the PlayStation 2 — or exceed it if possible.”The PS4’s performance has been boosted by growth in new markets such as the Middle East and China, after a 14-year ban on sales there was lifted in March.In Europe, Germany has become Sony’s largest console market for the first time, as gamers increasingly switch from PCs to Playstations.The company has been able to stay ahead of rivals such as Microsoft’s Xbox One and Nintendo’s Wii U partly through exclusive content partnerships with leading games makers. These have included a deal with Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest games publisher, for last month’s launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. Such deals have added to the PS4’s popularity with hardcore gamers.Although the portable PlayStation Vita has not fared so well, Sony’s home console has performed better than many analysts had anticipated, given the huge growth in mobile gaming in recent years.“Rumours of the demise of the console have been greatly exaggerated,” Mr House said.Mr House’s comments suggested a more aggressive target than some analysts had forecast for a business that is becoming ever more central to Sony’s wider turnround.Three years after its March 2000 launch, the PS2 had sold 51m units, and by the end of 2005 more than 100m had been sold.We’ve just seen the most successful Black Friday in the company’s historyIHS, the market researcher, predicted last month that the PS4 customer base would not exceed 100m until 2020. But if the PS4 follows the PS2’s trajectory over its first five years, that milestone could be reached by the end of 2018.Mr House was “hesitant to predict” that the PS4 would top the PS2’s lifetime sales of 155m, given “the cadence at which people expect innovation” was speeding up.He was speaking at the PlayStation Experience event in San Francisco, where Sony showed off its latest releases to 15,000 customers. Alongside demonstrations of the latest instalments of games including Street Fighter and Call of Duty, many attendees were most keen to try out the PlayStation virtual reality headset, slated for release in the first half of next year.Mr House admitted that he “started out as somewhat sceptical” of VR but was won over by The London Heist, a gangster game developed by one of Sony’s studios. “I had that amazing moment where I tried to put the controller on the table”, he said, only to realise that the table existed in the virtual world of his headset.Other early titles for PlayStation VR include: Ubisoft’s Eagle Flight, where the player soars above cities and between trees; Modern Zombie Taxi Co, a cartoonishly zany driving game; and 100ft Robot Golf, a science-fiction sports simulator.However, some leading publishers such as Electronic Arts and Activision have yet to announce significant commitments to VR gaming. IHS has predicted just 2.5m VR headsets will be sold next year, with PlayStation leading rivals such as Oculus and Vive, owned by smartphone maker HTC.“I don’t think those kinds of volumes would be either unrealistic or a disappointment,” Mr House said. “You don’t necessarily need tens of millions of units to be a solid platform for there to be a good, vibrant developer community — but it certainly helps.”Momentum in new VR content is “still more weighted towards the independent development community”, he admitted, as smaller companies were prepared to take bigger risks on a new technology where production costs may be lower than today’s multimillion-dollar console blockbusters.“We are seeing more of the majors start to get into this space,” he added. “We are at the start of a very new medium.

The chief executive of Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video games company, still worried that mobile games were all one-hit wonders, like Angry Birds and Flappy Bird, at a time when its latest Call of Duty title was minting $1bn on its first day on sale.“Right now we just don’t see anything that would suggest that changing the way we approach investing against mobile would be a good idea,” Mr Kotick told analysts on an earnings call in 2013.At the beginning of the decade, when many in the industry were chasing after Zynga’s FarmVille and other “social” games for Facebook, Mr Kotick had made a similarly counterintuitive move by launching Skylanders, a range of interactive toys. Sparking copycats from Disney to Nintendo, Skylanders became a $3bn franchise selling 250m action figures, while Zynga’s business has shrunk into irrelevance.Even if social gaming turned out to be a fad, however, the decision to overlook mobile would soon catch up with Mr Kotick. By the end of 2013, an addictive puzzle app called Candy Crush Saga was being played by 93m people every day. Last year, it drove revenues of $2.2bn for its developers, King Digital.This week, the 52-year-old Mr Kotick finally responded in bold style. Activision agreed to buy King for $5.9bn, creating a company with a combined audience of 500m monthly players.What Mr Kotick calls his “disciplined, deliberate and methodical” dealmaking has made Activision Blizzard the most valuable company in videogaming, its market capitalisation hitting a new all-time high this week of $27bn.Growing up in Long Island, New York, Mr Kotick was hustling from an early age, selling sandwiches and wallets at school. He started his first company, selling software for the Apple II personal computer, while studying art and literature at the University of Michigan. Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, persuaded him to drop out to pursue it full-time.Among the big names in Mr Kotick’s vast network, it was Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas hotels billionaire, who gave Mr Kotick his start, writing a $300,000 cheque for the 20-year-old after they met at the Cattle Barons’ Ball in Dallas.US group Activision Blizzard is paying $5.9bn for the creator of Candy Crush Saga, in the gaming industry’s biggest deal since Microsoft bought Minecraft last year. Robert Cookson talks to Tim Bradshaw, the FT’s technology correspondent in San Francisco, about the deal.The Apple software business was shortlived but, a few years later, Mr Wynn supported another venture by Mr Kotick: his attempt to revive a struggling games company called Mediagenic. Spun out of Atari, a maker of home computers, in 1979, the company had made popular games with titles such as Kaboom! and Pitfall. But by 1990, it had lost all its founders and the video games market had stalled.Mr Kotick bought a stake of the company for $400,000, moved it to Los Angeles and gave it back its original name: Activision. Gamers started gravitating towards the couch, playing games on televisions hooked up to powerful set-top consoles instead of sitting at computer screens, and the company followed them, doing ever-larger deals. LA studio Neversoft produced its first hit of the PlayStation era, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, in 1999. He picked up Guitar Hero — in which players put themselves in the shoes of Freddie Mercury, sporting plastic guitars that plug in to all major brands of console — for $100m in 2007. It became the first such game to reach $1bn in sales. That year also saw the first big hit of the Call of Duty franchise: Modern Warfare, which centres around special forces missions.Mr Kotick has a knack for minting blockbuster franchises that makes his friends in Hollywood jealous. But to critics — who have compared him with everyone from Star Wars baddie Emperor Palpatine to the cartoon villain Scrooge McDuck — the annual Call of Duty update puts profit ahead of creativity.Friends call that unfair. “He is an entrepreneur and a very bottom-line businessman,” says Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation. “But beyond that he is a very smart and intuitively great creative talent.”Mr Kotick certainly has a sizeable pay packet: he earned $6.9m last year, and made $64.9m in 2012, including a four-year stock scheme. Among the other beneficiaries of that wealth is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where Mr Kotick is a trustee.“He’s very generous and has been key to assembling the next generation of philanthropists,” says Lacma director Michael Govan, whom Mr Kotick convinced to move to LA from New York to take the post in 2006. “I can tell you first hand, he is a very persuasive person.”But at Activision, Mr Kotick can be less generous with company funds. “Bobby is really tight and makes sure they don’t overpay for anything,” says Michael Pachter, games analyst at Wedbush Securities. “He throws nickels around like they are manhole covers.”Mr Kotick’s own nickels are on the line. Together with Activision’s co-chairman Brian Kelly, he invested $100m two years ago as part of the $8.2bn deal to buy out Vivendi, the French media group that held a majority stake in the game maker. Even after that huge transaction and now the King deal, he is not standing still. Last month he hired the former chief executive of sports network ESPN to broadcast video games being played competitively. Movie offshoots are in the works, too.“He’s a great storyteller,” says Mr Katzenberg. “I don’t think I could touch him at his game.”The writer is the FT’s San Francisco correspondent.

The fuel is blended with petrol or shipped abroad.Even while US drivers burnt more fuel as they flocked to highways this year, ethanol refiners have been producing nearly 1m barrels per day, building up an inventory surplus.Juan Luciano, ADM chief executive, said the company’s operating profit margins in ethanol were a modest 18 cents per gallon in the third quarter.“We continue to confront very weak industry ethanol margins,” Mr Luciano said on a conference call with analysts.ADM reported profit of $252m, or 41 cents per share, in the three months ended in September, down about two-thirds from $747m, or $1.14 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted net income of 60 cents per share missed consensus estimates.With a large network of grain silos in the US, ADM was also hit by poor trading volumes in US grain. Corn and wheat prices are depressed and a strong dollar made other exporters more competitive.Mr Luciano said: “US farmers don’t like these prices. And at this point in time, they are holders of grain.”ADM shares, which have declined 17 per cent this year, were down 6.8 per cent at $43.15 by markets close.FitBit shares fell 8.7 per cent to $37.26 after the maker of wearable fitness devices disclosed plans for a follow-on offering and said it would lift lock-up restrictions on others.The San Francisco-based company said it planned to sell 7m shares and that certain stockholders were planning to sell 14m shares.Fitbit also said that it agreed to release the lock-up restrictions on its employees and consultants for 2.3m shares as of October 31.The news came alongside third-quarter profits that slid 33.5 per cent year-on-year to $45.8m, or 19 cents a share, in the three months ended in September and sales that nearly tripled to $409.3m, both ahead of expectations.Shares in Kellogg, the cereals and snacks maker, fell 3.6 per cent to $68.09 after the company reported disappointing third-quarter results as sales of its US breakfast foods slowed.The Michigan-based company reported profits of $205m, or 58 cents a share, compared with $224m, or 62 cents a share, in the year-ago period.Sales slid 8.5 per cent to $3.3bn, declining for the third straight quarter, and were shy of analysts’ estimates.Shares of King Digital Entertainment jumped 14.8 per cent to $17.84 in New York after Activision Blizzard agreed to pay $5.9bn to acquire the maker of Candy Crush Saga. Activision shares gained 3.6 per cent to $35.82.Energy shares rallied after news of supply disruptions in Brazil and Libya pushed oil prices higher.By close of trading, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 2,109.79, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 17,918.15 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 5,145.13.
40;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2015-11-03T15:32:19Z;Candy Crush: King is cash;Shelling out $5.9bn for the London group might be cheap and strategic;Mobile games have a lifespan that a guinea pig would not envy. Fresh and frisky at one, they are in their prime between two and four, and descend into doddery senescence thereafter. Investors risk paying up for a wonder when its one hit is about to become a memory. Who’s for a game of Angry Birds? Don’t embarrass me, gramps.In shelling out $5.9bn for King Digital Entertainment, console gaming company Activision Blizzard may have grabbed an asset with some good years left, without paying a speculative, youth-chasing price.Back in the mists of prehistory — in 2012 — King enjoyed explosive growth with Candy Crush Saga. Three years later, the blockbuster is a slowly declining money printer. King generated $600m in free cash last year. The price, at 10 times cash flow, would be rich if decline was all that lay ahead. But although King’s overall revenues peaked a year ago, there are signs of diversification. Sales generated away from the dwindling band of Candy Crushers rose from $250m the second quarter of 2014 to $324m a year later.Impressively, King achieved this without the sort of research spending splurge that younger companies embark upon. R&D spending has hovered around 10 per cent of sales at King, which contrasts favourably with Zynga, where it was closer to 50 per cent, or smaller and still growing Glu Mobile, at 25 per cent. Only privately owned Supercell is as good at turning R&D buck into revenue bang.The value of King is more than its cash flow. Console blockbuster factories such as Activision Blizzard used to register most of their revenue at the point of initial sale. King and Supercell have shown the advantage of a model based on the lifetime of the game: dribbles of cash for boosts that help the frustrated player along.Activision traces its history to 1979 (the Triassic period in gaming terms) and should be able to tell a trend from a cycle. Swiping luminous candies is a fad. Steadily milking casual gamers for drips of revenue is becoming a trend. Combining this with Activision’s knack for creating longer-lasting hits is logical. And in an industry where finding hits takes luck, logic is much in demand.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Please send any feedback to techFT@ft.com and encourage friends and colleagues to sign up hereFitbit falls flat, Vertu sold, beam me up CBSActivision chief executive Bobby Kotick has captured the flag again and crushed some candy with his $5.9bn acquisition of London-based King Digital.Kotick, whose consistent returns for investors are unrivalled in the video game industry, is a master at squeezing the maximum out of franchises with annual sequels to titles such as Call of Duty. He’s also a clever dealmaker – he combined Activision with Vivendi’s Blizzard to tap its success in online PC gaming and then took back his company with a buyout of Vivendi in 2013. Buying the maker of Candy Crush Saga fills a major hole in Activision’s offerings and gives it access to a massive mobile casual gaming audience.King had 474m monthly active users in the third quarter, although this was a 5 per cent decline from the previous quarter – a sign that Candy Crush’s appeal is starting to fade.Mr Kotick also got King cheap – the agreed $18 a share is below the $22.50 investors paid when King went public on the New York Stock Exchange last year. Doug Creutz, video game analyst at Cowen and Company, says “the deal is an absolute steal for Activision and immediately vaults them to being one of the top mobile gaming companies in the world”.Mobile and casual gaming are volatile businesses: Zynga and Rovio can testify to the peaks and troughs as franchises have faltered. So this is a smart move by King to come under the wing of a more diversified games publisher. And if anyone can keep players hooked on Candy, the sequel king Kotick can.Flag as ImportantFitbit stock fell by as much as 10 per cent after it disclosed that the fitness-tracker maker’s founders and some early investors planned to sell more than $750m worth of stock in a follow-on offering.

42;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;‘Candy Crush’ maker gives Activision a route to mobile gaming;Acquisition of King Digital for $5.9bn is effort to get to grips with smartphones;Size matters to Bobby Kotick, whose US video games group Activision Blizzard is paying $5.9bn to acquire the European leader in mobile gaming, King Digital.When Call of Duty — perhaps Activision’s best-known franchise — achieved launch-day sales records in successive years, Mr Kotick hailed the feat as the biggest entertainment launch in history, comparable with blockbuster movies.The price he has paid for the maker of Candy Crush Saga, one of the most popular games of all time, is also one of the biggest sums paid for any entertainment franchise in recent years. Walt Disney’s acquisitions of comic-character juggernaut Marvel and Lucasfilm were cheaper at $4bn each.The deal will be a windfall for King’s founders. Riccardo Zacconi, King chief executive, Melvyn Morris and Sebastian Knutsson, the company’s chief creative officer, own a combined 26.7 per cent of the company worth $1.6bn at the acquisition price.Mr Morris’s 11.3 per cent stake is worth about $666m, Mr Zacconi’s 9.9 per cent of the company about $584m and Mr Knutsson’s 5.5 per cent represents about $324m.Like Hollywood, the games industry is grappling with a shift from the big screen to the small. Mr Kotick is not too big to admit that Activision has fallen short.“We really haven’t had success in mobile, nor have we made investments in it,” he says.There are some small exceptions: Hearthstone, a mobile spin-off of Blizzard’s multiplayer online game World of Warcraft, has seen some success since its launch in April. But while Activision has tried to bring Call of Duty and Guitar Hero to smartphones and tablets, nothing else has really caught on.“One of the things we really respect about [King’s] business is it’s a different business,” Mr Kotick says. “We could have continued to invest in exploring this as an opportunity. But as much as we might have done so, I don’t think we could have ever caught up to the experience and capability that Riccardo and his team have.”That runs from the way games are designed and players are attracted in the overcrowded app stores to the way they make money.King is highly profitable, generating $119m of profit on $490m in revenues. But because most of its games can be downloaded and played for free on smartphones or the web, a tiny minority of King’s huge audience is responsible for much of that income. Just 7.6m, or 2.2 per cent, of King’s 340m monthly unique users made purchases of in-game upgrades or extra lives, in its second quarter.Each of those paying players spends a lot more than the typical 99 cent price of an app Store download: average monthly spending per paying user was $23.26 in King’s most recent quarter. However, that is still far below the $50 that Activision’s customers spend to buy a new console game such as Destiny or Call of Duty for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.Combined, the two companies will have a 500m-strong network of active users. That scale, Mr Kotick boasts, is topped only by Facebook and Google.Yet some analysts were puzzled by Activision’s move. Candy Crush remains a dominant force in mobile gaming but it hit its peak two years ago.King’s user numbers are edging downwards. Mr Zacconi said in Monday’s announcement that the company had 474m monthly active users in the third quarter of 2015, a 5 per cent decline from the previous quarter.US group Activision Blizzard is paying $5.9bn for the creator of Candy Crush Saga, in the gaming industry’s biggest deal since Microsoft bought Minecraft last year. Robert Cookson talks to Tim Bradshaw, the FT’s technology correspondent in San Francisco, about the deal.“The challenge with mobile games is turning one major hit into a sustainable stable of games,” says Dan Cryan, digital media analyst at research group IHS.Activision’s hope is that it can lure gamers with new twists on Candy Crush and King’s other formats, this time featuring its own brands and franchises, which date back to the earliest computer games on the early Atari, Commodore and Nintendo consoles.“We bring 35 years of intellectual property creation,” Mr Kotick says. “We have more IP that will be available to Riccardo than any other source.”Yet some analysts believe that today’s Activision games have more in common with the fantasy worlds of Machine Zone’s Game of War and Supercell’s Clash of Clans — so-called “mid-core” games that attract a smaller yet more dedicated audience than the casual gamers attracted to Candy Crush’s sugary treats.But Mr Zacconi, a former “entrepreneur in residence” at Benchmark, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, insists that is more important than thematic affinity.$6bn for the gaming group might prove a cheap and strategic move for ActivisionRead more“We have one of the largest networks and in my old Benchmark times, I learnt that it’s better to have access to a really wide audience and from there segment the audience and work out the different opportunities, than having a business that is very large in terms of revenues with a very narrow audience,” he says.If there is one Activision number that is not quite as big as it seems, it may be the price it paid for King.Michael Pachter, games analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that excluding King’s $900m in cash, Activision is paying about seven times operating cash flow.That is “not very expensive” given it will add 60-75 cents a share to annual earnings. Furthermore, it is partly paid for using Activision’s offshore cash pile, thus avoiding paying tax that would have been incurred by repatriating it to the US.At $18 per share, the offer is also a 20 per cent discount to King’s $22.50 initial public offering price a year and a half ago.“I compliment Activision for being introspective enough to realise they can’t do it on their own,” Mr Pachter says of the effort to use King as a way to move from console to mobile. “I compliment King for realising they are not a great standalone business. So together they have a chance.”Additional reporting by Robert Cookson in LondonThe sale of King Digital will be a landmark return on investment for Apax, the private equity firm that is its biggest shareholder with a 45 per cent stake, writes Joseph Cotterill.Apax will sell down all of its holding as part of the deal, generating $2.5bn (€2.3bn) — a return for its investors of over 90 times the money it originally invested in the company a decade ago, according to people familiar with the matter.This return, which includes €400m of previous proceeds from King Digital but does not count fees paid to Apax by the investors, would make the company one of the firm’s most successful investments ever.The average multiple on investments sold by Apax since January 2014, a fertile period for buyout groups to sell off investments as equity markets peaked, has been 3.8 times.The €29m investment in King Digital in 2005 was one of Apax’s last venture capital-style deals before the firm switched to focus on leveraged buyouts of bigger and older companies.Investors who bought shares in King following its initial public offering last year, in which Apax sold 2 per cent of its stake, have fared rather less well than the private equity group. The stock had fallen 30 per cent since the listing before the deal with Activision was announced.Apax declined to comment.

Activision will fund the deal with $3.6bn in cash held outside the US, consuming almost all of its offshore funds, and the remainder via debt.The acquisition, expected to close by early 2016, is conditional on approval of 75 per cent of votes to be cast by King investors at a meeting in Ireland, its corporate headquarters. The boards of both companies and a majority of King’s shareholders have already approved the deal.Riccardo Zacconi, King’s chief executive, along with chief creative officer Sebastian Knutsson and chief operating officer Stephane Kurgan, will stay on after signing “long-term” employment contracts.Last year, Microsoft used a portion of its offshore cash pile to pay $2.5bn for another European games company, Mojang, maker of the popular world-building game Minecraft, but was unable to retain the Swedish start-up's founders.King and Activision’s management first met three years ago but talks began in earnest in April, as King’s shares traded roughly 25 per cent below their IPO price.US group Activision Blizzard is paying $5.9bn for the creator of Candy Crush Saga, in the gaming industry’s biggest deal since Microsoft bought Minecraft last year. Robert Cookson talks to Tim Bradshaw, the FT’s technology correspondent in San Francisco, about the deal.“I think this is a deal which makes sense for investors and it makes sense from a strategic point of view for the business,” said Mr Zacconi.King was founded in Sweden in 2003 and has created more than 200 games from offices straddling London, Dublin and New York.Candy Crush, which was first launched on Facebook and smartphones in 2012, still accounts for more than a third of the company’s revenues. Overall consumer spending on King’s titles fell 13 per cent year on year in the second quarter.For Activision, the acquisition promises to be the most transformative since its $18.9bn combination in 2008 with Blizzard, the World of Warcraft maker then owned by Vivendi Games.Acquisition of King Digital for $5.9bn is effort to get to grips with smartphonesRead moreBacked by an investor group that included Mr Kotick and Chinese internet group Tencent, Activision bought itself out of Vivendi, the French entertainment group, in an $8.2bn transaction in October 2013.A handful of titles including Candy Crush, Supercell’s Clash of Clans, Machine Zone’s Game of War and Minecraft account for a disproportionately large amount of global consumer spending on smartphone games.Even some pioneers of mobile gaming such as Rovio, maker of Angry Birds, have struggled to build a steady business in a hits-driven market where consumer tastes can be fickle.For the UK’s tech industry, the deal is the biggest since Hewlett-Packard’s ill-fated acquisition of Autonomy in 2011. As the latest in a series of foreign takeovers, the King deal may reignite the debate over Europe’s ability to create long-lasting independent internet companies to rival those of Silicon Valley."
44;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Virtual reality in search for killer gaming app;Industry still needs ‘system seller’ to help persuade mainstream consumers to buy headsets;Mark Zuckerberg has already invested billions of dollars to bring virtual reality to the masses. But the night before Oculus Connect, a crucial showcase in Hollywood this week for the company’s Oculus Rift headset, something vital was missing from the line-up: a killer gaming app with global appeal.Since the first Oculus prototypes were sent to developers two and a half years ago, hundreds of games have been created for the pioneering VR device by a passionate community of enthusiasts.But while a few are extensions of familiar franchises, such as the space-fighter game Eve: Valkyrie, most of the biggest companies in the gaming sector such as Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard are absent.And while Oculus’s prototypes were the first to popularise a new generation of VR headsets, competition is looming from Sony’s PlayStation VR and Vive, a collaboration between smartphone maker HTC and games publisher Valve, to low-cost alternatives such as Google Cardboard and Microsoft’s forthcoming Hololens.Yet the entire VR industry is still searching for a so-called “system seller”, a product that will convince mainstream consumers to strap ungainly headsets to their faces.While Google Cardboard has provided a taste of the technology to an estimated 2m users, Oculus’s Rift and its high-end competitors will offer much more sophisticated experiences thanks to more powerful graphics and motion-tracking capabilities.Oculus Connect, the company’s annual developer event, is Facebook’s last opportunity to rally app makers and games creators before the Rift is released to consumers early next year.Early last year, Oculus executives identified one hugely popular title that would work particularly well in VR: Minecraft, the expansive world-building game that has sold more than 70m copies.“Minecraft was something I was desperate to get into virtual reality because I thought it would be critically important,” John Carmack, Oculus’s chief technology officer, told 1,500 Connect attendees on Thursday. “It’s the single most important application that we can have to ensure we have an army of fanatic, passionate supporters that will advocate why VR is great. It’s part of this infinite playability that our current ecosystem is missing.”But when Facebook acquired Oculus in March 2014 for $2bn, Minecraft creator Markus Persson pulled out of talks to bring the game to the system. “Facebook creeps me out,” he said.After Mojang, Minecraft’s parent company, was acquired by Microsoft for $2.5bn in September last year, Mr Carmack was given access to the game’s software code and began to adapt the software to VR.But despite months of work and “pestering” by Mr Carmack, it took an eleventh-hour meeting between Mr Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella, Microsoft chief executive, for the deal to be completed. It was finally signed late on Wednesday night, mere hours ahead of Oculus’s big event.The Minecraft partnership was announced by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey on Thursday morning. New apps were also unveiled to allow users to watch Netflix and Hulu videos in a virtual screening room and a cheaper version of Samsung’s smartphone-based headset, Gear VR, costing $99, about half the price of the original device.Even with household names such as Minecraft and Netflix on board, Oculus’s success is far from assured.Mr Zuckerberg opened the event by telling attendees that VR was the “next great technology platform” but he also warned that initial sales of headsets would grow “slowly”.Yet that did little to dent the enthusiasm of the games developers, Silicon Valley investors and Hollywood executives who have bought into the promise of VR.“We are in a once-in-a-century opportunity with VR,” says Martin Kenwright, a gaming industry veteran behind PlayStation games such as Motorstorm.Starship, Mr Kenwright’s new digital studio, has created a VR social networking app called vTime that allows users to connect online wherever they are in the real world. Users of the app can have their avatars meet within the technology to chat on virtual speedboats, planes and art galleries which have photos from users’ phones hanging on the walls. “We are in it for the long run,” he says.This week saw one of the largest funding rounds for a VR start-up, as Walt Disney and Evolution Media Partners led a $65m investment in Jaunt, a maker of live-action “cinematic VR” technology.Rick Hess, founder of Evolution, a joint venture between talent agency CAA, investment firm TPG Growth and Hollywood producer Participant Media, says he invested after watching a Grateful Dead concert that had been filmed by the company.“The experience of being at a live event was mind-blowing,” he says. “It’s so immersive because it’s 360-degree, and you get to control what you look at.”Facebook added the ability to view such 360-degree videos to its news feed this week.Mr Hess believes that the implications for live sports, television news and cinema are far-reaching.“I think this has the same resonance and impact on film that sound did,” he says. ”It will force a reinvention of storytelling.”But even some who are convinced by VR’s potential are taking a more cautious approach until they see how consumers respond to Oculus.“We’re really intrigued by VR, but we are investigating in an experimental way rather than betting huge resources on it,” says Michael Acton Smith, founder and chairman of Mind Candy, creator of online children’s game Moshi Monsters.While Mr Acton Smith says the technology will “disrupt multiple industries”, he predicts making money from VR games will be “challenging” in the short term.Anjney Midha, a partner in the early-stage Edge fund at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, believes that the lower price Gear VR will help bring the technology to a mass audience of smartphone owners. But he cautions that too many developers are focusing on the wrong areas and likens the VR market to the early days of the iPhone’s App Store.“There was a first wave of app developers who went after the most intuitive and logical problems. Either they were too early or the [mobile] platforms ended up building many of those apps themselves,” he says. “There was a second wave of companies that ended up building more mature apps. In VR, I worry sometimes that we are in the first wave right now.”The experience of being at a live event was mind-blowing. It’s so immersive because it’s 360-degree, and you get to control what you look atDemonstrations of games at Oculus Connect ranged from Bullet Train, a first-person shooting game inspired by science-fiction movie The Matrix that allows the player to slow down time and catch bullets, to Job Simulator, which puts the player in an office cubicle in an imagined future when computers have made human employees unnecessary.Oculus also unveiled Medium, an artistic program that uses motion-sensing controllers to sculpt 3D “digital clay”.Brendan Iribe, Oculus chief executive, says the company’s approach to finding the Rift’s “killer app” is more like Apple or Microsoft, which rely on external developers to invent new uses for their platforms, than Nintendo, whose in-house games such as Super Mario and Pokemon keep fans coming back to buy its consoles.“We are focusing mostly on the platform but we make a few core services,” Mr Iribe says, including Medium and Oculus Video. “A lot of that is to inspire other developers.”While Minecraft is an important win for Oculus, Mr Iribe predicts that the hit games of the VR world will make a clear break from what has existed previously. “For the most part, the really big ‘system sellers’ are going to be made-for-VR experiences, something brand new,” he says.Ustwo, the studio behind hit mobile game Monument Valley, this week unveiled its first foray into virtual reality called Land's End.The game is a gentler experience than most of the shoot-‘em-ups and space flight simulators on show at Oculus Connect. It requires no handheld controller or complex tutorial. Instead, the player floats around a stylised landscape and unlocks puzzles simply by staring at particular spots.“This opportunity to shape a medium doesn’t come along very often,” says Peter Pashley, technical director at Ustwo.Ustwo has offices in London, New York, Malmo and Sydney. Monument Valley, an MC Escher-inspired puzzler, won several awards from Apple and Bafta for its geometric design and original gameplay.“It took a long time for the major game companies to figure out how to make iPhone games,” said Ken Wong, lead designer at Ustwo. “Here we are again with VR where the rules haven’t been set.”Mr Pashley warns of a “huge spike in the learning curve” when developing for VR. Much of the software for the Oculus devices created so far is of uneven quality, raising questions about whether consumers will want to buy them.“I don’t think they are going to sell 20m units just through the content we are seeing today,” he says.Land's End runs on the Gear VR, a $99 headset created in collaboration between Oculus and Samsung that uses Galaxy smartphones as its screen. It is much cheaper and more portable than the PC-based Oculus Rift but lacks sophisticated head-tracking.The Land's End experience was designed to avoid the nausea which can sometimes be caused by action-packed VR games. For example, most of the 3D virtual environment — from mountains and rolling oceans to strange standing stones — is seen from a distance, because putting objects too close to the viewer can cause queasiness.“Some people choose to put you in something fast-moving and dizzying,” Mr Wong says. “We want to take care of you and give you a good time.”

He was shown to a room with a television on which was displayed an image of a pond with bubbles floating to the surface. Satoru Iwata, Nintendo’s president, handed him a games controller called a wand and guided his hand to cast a virtual fishing line.As Mr Kotick drew back the wand, observed by Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo’s chief games designer, a fish popped out of the pond. “I remember the delight on their faces as they saw me realise that this would change the face of entertainment — these two guys who had the instinct, the courage and the vision to do something radically different,” he says.Iwata, who this week died of cancer at 55, was often regarded as the business partner to a creative genius — the Roy Disney to Mr Miyamoto’s Walt, the Domenico de Sole to Mr Miyamoto’s Tom Ford at Gucci, or the business half of Steve Jobs’s brain at Apple. That understates his role in guiding Nintendo to an extraordinary coup with the launch of the Wii console in 2006.Putting a low-tech console, running quirky games for family entertainment, up against the high-definition technology of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Sony’s PlayStation 3 was like entering a Fiat 500 in a Formula One race. The contest amounted to “fun, magic and joy against brute processing power,” says Michael Acton Smith, founder of the games publisher Mind Candy.Fun, magic and joy — the qualities of Nintendo games from Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda to Wii Sports — won. I attended the E3 video games show in Los Angeles at the time, and saw the adulation when Mr Miyamoto walked on stage in a wizard costume. Sony’s multi-threaded chip for the PlayStation 3 could not match that.The games industry does not sound important, so Nintendo’s revival under Iwata is easy to ignore compared with feted turnrounds such as Jobs’s rescue of Apple or Louis Gerstner’s of IBM. It was equally revolutionary, though — a triumph against the odds that turned video gaming from a niche hobby of teenagers and young adults into family-oriented fun.Like Jobs, the two men achieved this by trusting in their instincts — and the company’s heritage — and obstinately ignoring everyone else. “Nintendo has always gone its own way. They have never compromised and never cared what their competitors are doing,” says Ian Livingstone, the UK games entrepreneur who is chairman of Midoki and Playdemic.Nintendo’s obstinacy has recently carried a high price. Iwata’s refusal to let his brands appear on mobile phones, instead sticking with the “walled garden” tradition of gamers having to buy its devices to play the company’s games, resulted in it being squeezed between PlayStation 4 and casual games such as Mind Candy’s Moshi Monsters and Minecraft, now owned by Microsoft.After three years of losses, Iwata re­versed course just before his death, signing deals to put Nintendo characters on mobile gaming apps, as well as in Universal theme parks. The Mario brothers and Zelda are to escape captivity under the new leadership of Mr Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda, a director.Nintendo always was a roller-coaster enterprise, its refusal to compromise on its sensibility and its business model leading both to stunning highs and deep lows. It was ambushed by Sega with Sonic the Hedgehog in the 1990s before Sega faltered with the failure of its Dreamcast console and retreated to being purely a games publisher. Many analysts expected Nintendo to also succumb to Sony and Microsoft at the time that Iwata took charge.Iwata, however, understood one thing that his competitors did not: that magic beats technology. Nintendo had proved able to transcend the limited technology of its earlier devices — the Nintendo Entertainment System console in 1985 and the Game Boy handheld in 1989 — with quirky, amusing characters and intricate games design.By the early 2000s, the console wars had narrowed to speed and high-definition images. Both Sony and Microsoft thought the way to win was to offer more realistic and immersive versions of shooting and sports games such as Halo and Madden NFL, played largely by male “core gamers”. The video games industry became tangled up in a high-definition standards battle.Knowing that Nintendo was bound to lose this contest, Iwata aimed at something else entirely: expanding the size of the market. Instead of one person having to pay $499 for a PlayStation 3, he sold the family a Wii for $249 with games such as tennis and bowling. Rather than crushing wars, he offered charming light entertainment.Even amid Nintendo’s current troubles, his insight is still being proved true. Most games are not battles and most people seek fun and amusement, whether on a gaming device or a mobile phone. It is about the magic, not the bandwidth of the wand.john.gapper@ft.com
46;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2015-03-02T06:52:29Z;Developers see the future of games on smaller mobile screens;Consoles are being supplanted by mobile devices;When King Digital Entertainment launched its eagerly awaited follow-up to the popular mobile game Candy Crush Saga, it looked far beyond Apple’s App Store to promote it.Videos heralding the arrival of the Candy Crush Soda Saga blitzed 100m Facebook newsfeeds in a single day. TV spots aired in 20 countries and digital billboards were flooded with fizzy bubbles around the globe.The multimillion-dollar launch illustrates that mobile gaming is no longer a poor relation of video games. Newzoo, a research company, forecasts that the mobile games industry, which it says has predicted global revenues of $30.3bn in 2015, is poised to overtake console games sales for the first time.Underlining the transition, Newzoo said in a report that Apple’s forecast $4bn in gaming revenues — made from just hosting and selling other developers’ games, for which it takes a 30 per cent cut — is likely to be almost double Nintendo’s sales this year.As mobile games have increased in sophistication, growing numbers of players spend many hours — and dollars — on addictive titles such as Clash of Clans, Minecraft and Game of War: Fire Age.“The first wave of mobile games was simplistic — the gameplay was there but the polish wasn’t,” says Julian Farrior, chief executive of Backflip Studios, the mobile gaming company behind DragonVale and Seabeard, which is now majority owned by toymaker Hasbro.But, Mr Farrior adds: “Over time, the polish has increased, the budget has increased and revenue expectations have increased.”In the App Store’s early days, barriers to entry were low. But, as it has become harder to be noticed in an overcrowded market, promoting and distributing a hit game has become an expensive but important part of the marketing mix.“It’s a very competitive market,” says Riccardo Zacconi, King Digital’s chief executive. “The ‘top grossing’ charts are very stable. It’s a handful of developers there and the conditions for succeeding are very hard.”Despite this, King’s marketing drove Soda Saga to the top of Apple and Google’s app download charts globally for November. In its earnings report, King said it set a new quarterly record of 1.5bn average daily game plays in the three months to December.But King has an advantage other games makers do not. As well as the external advertising, many people downloading Soda Saga did so because they saw an ad in the original Candy Crush game, which has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times.Electronic Arts, a veteran console games maker, has franchises that are just as well known as King’s, including John Madden NFL football and Fifa Soccer. Even so, EA is only just starting to find its feet in mobile.Andrew Wilson, EA’s chief executive, says the company had a “breakout performance” in mobile over Christmas, generating a “record” $121m in sales, up 25 per cent over the prior year.Its rival, Activision Blizzard, whose Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises have dominated console and PC gaming, has been even slower to mobile.In late 2013, Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive, said there was nothing that had driven any sizeable amount of operating profit in mobile gaming. But in its recent earnings call, Activision’s chiefs admitted mobile and tablet gaming had “moved up on our priority list” after finding success with a Warcraft spin-off, Hearthstone.Activision’s chiefs now say mobile gaming has ‘moved up’ their priority listIn the console world, developers create games and leave it to publishers, such as EA and Activision, to work with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo on distribution. Mobile games are usually free, with revenue generated from ads or in-app sales.“When you’re thinking about that transition, it isn’t wholly intuitive to console developers who are reliant on publishers for distribution,” says Mr Farrior. “In mobile, you own the distribution and the development of the piece. That’s . . . outside the comfort zone for traditional publishers.”Another challenge for console developers is that mobile games are created and updated very differently. Console games are typically left unchanged, but mobile games, once on a device, can be updated almost constantly.King, for example, adjusts the difficulty of Soda Saga’s levels every few weeks. The first “cohort” of players was looking for something more difficult than the original Candy Crush, Mr Zacconi says, while newer players want something easier.Despite the different dynamics, Mr Farrior says mobile studios such as Backflip are hiring console games developers in much greater numbers. “We’ve had to hire truly talented experience, and the bulk of that experience was in shifting from console to mobile.”Backflip is planning to use Hasbro’s brands and characters to help its games stand out. But even names that could include My Little Pony and Transformers are not enough to guarantee a hit in the mobile gaming world, Mr Farrior says.“A brand is important, but a brand alone won’t get you there,” he says.To succeed, he says, you need an “absolutely killer game”, with high retention and conversion from free downloads to paying customers. “You need to marry the good math with the good brand and have a really talented, aggressive user acquisition team.”
47;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2014-09-23T15:40:18Z;Mobile gaming: missing the jackpot;Why are gaming companies missing out on ad revenues?;Time is money. And if you are spending your time staring at a mobile phone, then that is where the money is. Advertisers know that – eMarketer expects ad spending on mobiles to grow 92 per cent this year. But the mobile gaming world is struggling to win its fair share of those ad dollars.Android users spend a third of their device time playing games, says Flurry, an analytics company owned by Yahoo. By comparison, Facebook gets 17 per cent of phone time. But advertising in mobile games – about $6bn a year – is less than Facebook’s mobile ad revenue. The business model is different – for now: mobile games make their money from in-app purchases, to the tune of $18bn this year, with sales growing 20 per cent annually.But the growth in mobile ad spending is a lost opportunity for the gaming industry. One reason is that no one has quite figured out how to do mobile game ads well. Banner ads are tacky. And ads that are successful demand a lot of development work – such as the virtual Lexus in Real Racing 3 (by Electronic Arts). Some companies, such as Tencent, eschew ads altogether. But as it is, mobile games are less lucrative than their console counterparts. Average revenue per user in mobile games is only one-tenth of the Arpu for console games, according to Interpret.True, some gaming groups do mobile better than others. At Electronic Arts, mobile accounts for a fifth of revenues after 30 per cent growth last year. At Activision Blizzard, by contrast, mobile provides just 6 per cent of sales (excluding distribution), and mobile revenues have fallen by half from the same period last year.But there is a long way to go for the industry as a whole. The prize will be valuable for whoever cracks the code first: Android users spend 37 minutes a day playing mobile games on average, says Flurry. That figure rises to more than 45 minutes daily in the US and Germany. There’s more money here than in just buying extra lives.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
48;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2014-09-10T17:56:26Z;Activision hails its $500m Destiny launch;;Activision Blizzard has claimed another videogaming milestone after its new title Destiny sold $500m worth of software in its first day.The games publisher sees Destiny as its next blockbuster franchise after Call of Duty, which on several occasions in recent years has beat Hollywood movies to become the biggest-selling entertainment franchise in its opening weekends.On Wednesday, Activision said Destiny, which was made by the creators of Halo, the flagship Microsoft Xbox series, had become the most successful new franchise launch in videogame history, based on the amount of software shipped to retailers. Activision has previously said it invested $500m in developing and marketing the title.Nonetheless, Destiny’s first-day sales still lag some way behind the latest episode in the Grand Theft Auto series. Take Two Entertainment's GTA V sold $800m worth of copies on its first day last September.After spiking in early trading, shares in Activision Blizzard closed up only 0.34 per cent at $23.81, after rising by almost a third so far this year.Destiny is a science-fiction shooting game that gamers can play against each other in online, multiplayer battles. It features music composed by Paul McCartney.Piers Harding-Rolls, games analyst at IHS, said Activision’s track record in creating new franchises was “enviable”.“Destiny’s sales are very strong for an entirely new game and franchise at this stage of the hardware cycle and these sales will result in a strong profitable return from the game in the coming days and weeks,” he said.Destiny’s early popularity also reflects Activision’s successful bet on prioritising Sony’s PlayStation 4 over Microsoft’s Xbox One console in Tuesday’s release of the game. The game comes bundled with a new white edition of the PS4 and Sony gamers get extra content not yet available for Xbox.Almost a year into the latest console cycle, Sony has established a clear lead over Microsoft, with more than 10m units sold worldwide, exceeding market expectations.Activision predicts that Destiny will become a “billion-dollar brand” for the company after launching in more than 178 countries on Tuesday.“Based on extraordinary audience demand, retail and first party orders worldwide have exceeded $500m for Destiny,” said Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive. “This industry milestone marks another blockbuster success for our company.”
49;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2014-06-20T17:41:55Z;Cash-rich Vivendi abandons the wild years;;"For many years, there has been one overriding question hanging over Vivendi, the Paris-based group that started life under Napoleon III as a water utility: why does it exist?The hotchpotch of television and film, telecommunications, recorded music and even gaming assets seemed to many investors more a product of its wild years in the boom-and-bust dotcom era than the consequence of a considered strategy guided by a strong industrial logic.But when Jean-René Fourtou hands over the chairmanship to billionaire and top Vivendi shareholder Vincent Bolloré next Tuesday, investors will probably be asking a set of different questions.In the past year, Mr Fourtou and his management team headed by Jean-François Dubos have sold billions of euros in assets. First came the sale of Vivendi’s 53 per cent stake in Maroc Telecom for €4.2bn last summer. Days later, it sold most of its majority stake in Activision Blizzard, the Californian gaming company, for $8.2bn.Most recently, and in a script worthy of a place in Vivendi’s Borgia hit drama series, it has agreed to sell its French SFR telecoms unit to European cable group Altice in a deal with a €13.5bn cash payment.The result is a new-look Vivendi based around the Canal Plus pay-TV unit, Universal Music Group, the world’s largest recorded-music company, and GVT, the Brazilian telecommunications company.With an estimated €12bn in revenues for 2014 compared to €29bn in 2011, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of €2.2bn, the Paris-based group is considerably smaller than its former sprawling self.But analysts agree that Vivendi 2.0 is also leaner and certainly closer to the media and entertainment group that Mr Fourtou first hinted at two years ago when he promised investors a “no taboos” rethink about the future.In the process, the mega-sale has transformed the debt profile. Assuming the sale of SFR goes uncontested by French anti-competition authorities, Vivendi will probably be sitting on more than €2bn in net cash by the end of this year – even after paying shareholder dividends, according to the company.Contrast that with the €13.4bn of net debt that hung heavily around Vivendi’s neck as recently as the end of 2012. As one person close to Mr Bolloré said, “Vincent will be starting with a blank canvas”.The problem is that it is not always obvious what to do with a blank canvas. For starters, says Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Bernstein Research, there is the conundrum of how to find synergies between the rapidly changing recorded-music industry and Vivendi’s Canal Plus Group, which makes films and television programmes but also broadcasts premium content such as the UK’s Premier League football.Even more difficult, he says, is finding synergies with Vivendi’s media and content core and GVT, its Brazilian telecoms arm that it tried to sell in 2012 but failed when nobody would pay the $10.4bn asking price.In an interview with the FT last year, the 62-year-old Mr Bolloré, charming and intense in equal measure, made it clear that a sale of GVT was no longer part of the plan. “Now we have a financial structure which is healthy so we don’t need to sell anything and we don’t intend to sell anything,” he said.Yet many analysts continue to believe that the “fit” between telecoms and media and content is not really a fit at all, and that in a perfect world Vivendi would be better off disposing of GVT in the way that it had originally wanted to do.“In theory, Vivendi wants to be a media company but it sold Activision Blizzard and yet held on to GVT,” says Mr Aspesi. “These are decisions that are not ideologically pure.”One bright spot is the increasing optimism surrounding the recorded music industry. After years of trauma caused by rapidly changing technology and the resulting decline in CD sales, industry data show that music sales via streaming services grew 32 per cent last year.For UMG, where sales were €4.9bn in 2013, or about 40 per cent of the new Vivendi’s overall annual revenue, those trends are clearly welcome. Even so, streaming for now remains a tiny part of overall music sales. While industry experts fully expect it to dominate future growth, there is also consensus that it will take at least a couple of years.Overarching all of this is the fundamental question that Vivendi shareholders have been asking during the past few months – what to do with all the cash.Given the size of Vivendi’s music business – UMG accounts for about 35 per cent of the world’s recorded music industry – the chances of growing through acquisitions are next to none.That leaves Canal Plus. Vivendi executives are upbeat about prospects. They point to the fact that more than 40 per cent of its business is now done outside France, and to alliances such as its co-production of The Tunnel with UK-based Sky last year.“Canal Plus is not nearly as Franco-centric as you would think,” says one Vivendi executive.But France, a mature market with high unemployment and where macroeconomic growth prospects remain in the air, still accounts for the bulk of revenue. Canal Plus’s future is also clouded by the expected entry this year of Netflix to several more European countries, including France, which would increase competition.People close to Vivendi say that Mr Bolloré, together with Arnaud de Puyfontaine, Vivendi’s soon-to-be chief executive and a respected French businessman with a solid transatlantic record, are unlikely to make any big decisions beyond a renewed management board before the autumn.One person close to the group says that working out how best to use Vivendi’s cash, and how best to build its media business so as to avoid simply reverting to the previous mishmash of disparate assets is something that will not happen overnight.Then again, that would be in keeping with Mr Bolloré’s timeframe. As he told the FT at the end of last year, “We stop now to look at the price of the share and the short term, and we start to look at the long term”.Sarkozy’s friend and the solverVincent Bolloré and Jean-René Fourtou – the incoming and outgoing chairmen of Vivendi– have a few things in common. They are both instantly likeable, and have also both demonstrated a measure of loyalty to the people who have surrounded them throughout their careers, writes Adam Thomson.That is where the similarities end. Mr Fourtou, who turned 75 on Friday, was born near Bordeaux and graduated from the elitist École Polytechnique near Paris. He loves fine wine and golf, and has a passion for rugby.Mr Bolloré, who owns 5 per cent of Vivendi and will take over at the group’s annual general meeting on Tuesday, comes from Brittany, studied law, prefers Diet Coke over wine and collects comic books.Mr Fourtou carved a very public reputation as a corporate problem solver – first at the then-nationalised Rhone-Poulenc, the pharmaceuticals company where his restructuring plan tripled sales in a decade; then at Vivendi, where he pulled the group back from the abyss after a frenetic acquisition spree under the leadership of Jean-Marie Messier.Mr Bolloré, who is a close friend of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, has kept a lower profile, slowly building the family business, which originally made paper for cigarettes and bibles, and diversifying into plastics, and then into transport and logistics, particularly in Africa, as well as cotton and cacao.More recently, he started investing heavily in electricity storage and is behind Paris’s Autolib electric car-rental service. Today, his Bolloré group has almost 55,000 employees and annual revenues of close to €11bn. He is one of France’s richest men, and Forbes calculates his net worth to be $8.5bn.Back to the top of the page"

Its shares were 8.8 per cent higher at $21.01.The beverages sector was boosted by positive results from Molson Coors after the brewing company reported better than expected earnings, driven by improved performance across all its businesses.Its first-quarter results suggested a strategy of focusing on premium beers had paid off for the group.Profits – helped by the early ending of a Canadian joint venture – surged more than fivefold. The company’s shares climbed 3.65 per cent to $61.95.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Mondelez International shares jumped 8.2 per cent to $38.10 after it posted first-quarter earnings and said it had reached a deal with Dutch coffee and tea company D.E Master Blenders to combine their coffee businesses.By contrast, Whole Foods shares tumbled in their steepest fall for more than five years after the largest US natural grocer warned of increasing competition from popular store chains. Shares in the retailer were down 18.81 per cent to $38.93.Allergan, the US pharmaceutical company behind an anti-wrinkle treatment designed to fend off the effects of ageing, came under further pressure to accept a takeover proposal.The US maker of Botox, which last month received a bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, repeated again on Wednesday that it would “review and consider” the approach.David Pyott, Allergan chief executive, is under pressure from the company’s largest shareholder, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, to accept Valeant’s bid.Allergan has been reported to be examining whether there are other potential buyers for the company.Its latest injunction to investors came alongside its first-quarter earnings, which showed a jump in revenues from $1.45bn to $1.65bn.Profits, excluding certain items, for the quarter came in at $1.18 a share, better than the $1.13 analysts forecast.Nonetheless, shares in the group fell 0.27 per cent to $165.87.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.32 per cent to 4,067.67; the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.72 per cent to 16,518.54; and the S&P 500 added 0.56 per cent to 1,878.21."
51;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2014-04-20T18:11:21Z;Toys: tough puzzle;The growth of tablets and smartphones has hit toymakers;The business of child’s play is in fact anything but that. Toy and games makers are going through a sticky patch. Mattel, one of the world’s largest toymakers, had a poor 2013 due partly to poor sales of Barbie dolls. Japan’s Namco Bandai (Power Rangers) in February cut its forecasts because of tough North American and European markets. Life is even harder for specialist retailers. Profits at private equity-owned Toys R Us have halved since 2009. And the UK’s Mothercare had a dismal Christmas, leading to the departure of its chief executive.Part of the problem boils down to the macro picture. Children can be insistent, but paying the bills comes first. Partly (for the retailers) it is the shift to online sales and the growth of non-specialists. And partly it is the growth of tablets and smartphones. Why spend $140 on Barbie’s Malibu Dreamhouse if Candy Crush Saga will occupy the little angels just as well?All of these are plausible, but none explains why some companies are thriving. Lego is the starkest example– profits have risen from DKr1.3bn in 2008 to DKr6.1bn in 2013. Not bad for a company whose basic product is more than 50 years old. Its success is down to the development of new brands such as Chima and Friends. Others want to get in on the act – in February Mattel bought Lego rival Mega Brands for $460m.All is not lost for the toymakers. According to Euromonitor the global toy market will grow by about 8 per cent a year between now and 2017. But within that, digital gaming is growing at double-digit rates while traditional products languish at 6 per cent. The successful toymakers will be those that can tap digital trends. The child-friendly tablets from the likes of Leapfrog and Vtech are one example.

52;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-10-13T16:22:42Z;Activision: fair play?;Investor gains should not have had to come with the sweetheart deal for company brass;"There is so much money to be made, if it was not for those pesky shareholders mucking things up. Take the machinations in the deal Vivendi struck in July, through which it reduced its 61 per cent stake in games maker Activision Blizzard. Sure, there were big benefits for Activision (its shares jumped as much as a fifth). But the transaction includes an arrangement where the chief executive, board co-chair and their private equity chums buy Activision shares on the cheap.Shareholders were not allowed a vote to sanction the deal and, following a legal challenge, a lower Delaware court had stopped the deal from closing. But last week, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed that ruling, so Vivendi’s divestment will happen. Most investors can exhale now; they will keep their gains. But those gains should not have had to come with the sweetheart deal for Activision brass.Vivendi is dumping 601m of its 684m Activision shares. Activision is buying 429m shares at $13.60 per share, a discount of a tenth to the previous share price. And so enough shares will be retired to boost earnings per share by up to a third. That benefit goes to all shareholders.Activision, however, did not have the financial muscle to buy back all the shares that Vivendi wanted to sell. No problem, as the chief executive’s investor group stepped in to grab the remaining 172m shares. The group will therefore own 25 per cent of the new Activision. Amazingly, the quarter stake was acquired for a litigation-inducing $13.60/share, as well. A quarter stake is not a controlling one – but big enough that it should not be so easily snatched, especially in light of how the stock has risen since.If the chief executive and his pals could craft a sweet deal like this three months ago (his group is up about $600m already), imagine the value they will able to extract down the road with a 25 per cent stake.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
53;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-09-19T11:09:36Z;US court delays Vivendi’s $8.2bn Activision stake sale;;A US court has delayed Vivendi’s planned $8.2bn sale of most of its stake in Activision Blizzard, the California-based gaming business, the company has confirmed.The French media and telecoms conglomerate said on Wednesday that the court had issued an order suspending the proposed sale unless the terms were either modified or approved via an Activision shareholder vote.The decision by the Delaware court came after a lawsuit filed last week arguing that any such sale could not proceed without submitting it to a vote.On Thursday, a Vivendi spokesperson said the company was “looking at all possible options”. A company statement the previous evening said that Vivendi and Activision Blizzard remained “committed to a swift conclusion of the transaction”.Analysts on Thursday said the delay was almost certainly more of an inconvenience than an upending of Vivendi’s proposed sale of its shares, as it pushes forward with wider plans to reshape its sprawling empire into a company more focused on entertainment.Among other units, the group owns Universal Music Group and the Canal Plus television channel.As part of that restructuring, Vivendi announced on July 25 it would sell 429m Activision shares back to the company for $5.83bn, or $13.60 a share.It also said it would sell a further 172m shares at the same price to an investor group headed by Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive, and Brian Kelly, co-chairman.The two deals were priced at a 10 per cent discount to Activision’s closing price of $15.18 before the announcement.At the time, Vivendi said it would use some of the cash to pay down its net debt, which stood at €13.4bn at the end of last year. The company has since announced a plan to split in two by spinning off its SFR telecoms business in France.In a note on Thursday, Tom Singlehurst, Citi telecoms analyst, called the court’s decision “an unexpected turn of events”. But he concluded it was probably little more than a simple delay. “It is extremely likely that the transaction will be approved,” he wrote.Activision shareholders would almost certainly approve the proposed sale in the event of a vote, analysts said – not least because the sale price now stood at a discount of more than 20 per cent to Activision’s current share price.They added that the court decision would have no bearing on Vivendi’s stated desire to spin off SFR given that the process did not rely on events at Activision.But Mr Singlehurst of Citi said the court decision could nonetheless “delay any proactive cash usage on behalf of the ‘core’ Vivendi, either a buyback or asset purchases both of which have been alluded to by the company”.
54;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-08-29T13:41:15Z;Vivendi trims TV and telecoms forecasts;;Vivendi trimmed forecasts for its pay-TV and telecoms divisions on Thursday, but said its Universal Music business was on track to meet full-year expectations.The French conglomerate, which has transformed itself this year by agreeing to sell its majority stakes in video game maker Activision Blizzard and phone operator Maroc Telecom, said the proceeds from the asset sales would more than halve its net debt to about €6.5bn.To comply with international financial reporting rules, Vivendi excluded Activision Blizzard and Maroc Telecom from its adjusted earnings for the six months to the end of June.Group revenues fell 1.5 per cent to €10.8bn compared with the first half of 2012. In constant currency terms, the revenue decline was just 0.2 per cent.Adjusted net income dropped 25 per cent to €845m over the period. The decline was mainly down to the weak performance of SFR, the French telecoms operator, which has been hit by a fierce mobile phone price war in the country.SFR’s revenues amounted to €5.1bn, an 11.3 per cent decrease compared with first-half 2012.Vivendi declined to say whether it was planning to spin off SFR in an initial public offering, as it has previously said was a possibility.However, it pointed to a slowing in the rate of earnings falls at SFR, thanks to cost cuts. SFR’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were down 16.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 20.5 per cent over the whole of the first half.Looking ahead to the full year, Vivendi trimmed its earnings guidance for SFR slightly to €2.8bn. It also slightly reduced its earnings forecasts for Canal Plus, its pay-TV division, and scaled back revenue forecasts for GVT, its Brazilian fixed-line telecoms group.Universal, the world’s biggest music company by revenues, was still on track to hit its full-year targets thanks to strong growth in digital sales, Vivendi said.Universal’s revenues were €2.2bn in the first half, up 16.3 per cent compared with the first half of 2012. Digital sales represented 53 per cent of recorded music sales, up from 47 per cent in the same period last year.Jean-François Dubos, Vivendi chief executive, said the company’s subsidiaries were facing a “challenging economic environment and highly competitive markets”.He said the group’s priorities included generating strong cash flows and helping SFR adapt to new market conditions.Vivendi said the planned sales of the majority of its interest in Activision Blizzard and its entire interest in Maroc Telecom were expected to close by the end of September and the end of December, respectively.However, it declined to comment on the potential for cash returns to shareholders through dividends or buybacks.Vivendi’s shares rose 2.8 per cent to €15.77 by early afternoon in Paris.
55;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-07-26T18:43:36Z;Vivendi’s overhaul begins with Activision;;Vivendi’s $8.2bn sale of most of its holding in Activision Blizzard left the French group's stock little changed on Friday, but shares in the California video games company jumped 13 per cent on the complex deal with an investor whose 61 per cent stake had weighed on its valuation.Vivendi’s partial exit comes as it looks to make good on a pledge, made more than a year ago, to carry out a “no taboos” overhaul of its sprawling telecoms and media empire.Philippe Capron, Vivendi’s chief financial officer, yesterday told investors that the proceeds of the Activision deal would help satisfy an essential part of that overhaul, by reducing the company’s €13.2bn net debt as it focused on media content.“The first priority will be to deleverage, strengthen our balance sheet, defend our BBB rating,” Mr Capron said. “The board will then have to work on a plan to see what we do with the rest of the proceeds.”Analysts welcomed the reduction in Vivendi’s debt, but Patrick Kirby of Deutsche Bank cautioned that it was selling out of its best growth business “at a disappointing price”. Claudio Aspesi of Bernstein Research said the Activision sale left Vivendi’s strategy of focusing on media “confused and shrunk”.Mr Capron said Vivendi, which owns Universal Music and Canal Plus, the French pay-TV company, had no significant large acquisitions in sight.He confirmed, though, that its stronger financial position following the sale of the company behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft would let it prepare a possible spin-off of SFR, France’s second-biggest telecoms company by subscribers, which accounts for more than a third of group sales.“We are contemplating the possibility of a spin off,” Mr Capron said on Friday, but the board would “take its time”. Vivendi said this week that SFR had entered talks with Bouygues Telecom, another French provider, to share their networks in the country’s competitive telecoms sector.Under the deal, Activision Blizzard will use about $1.2bn in cash and roughly $4.6bn of debt to buy 429m shares from Vivendi. An investor group led by ­Activision chief executive Bobby Kotick will buy a further 172m shares for about $2.34bn in cash.Mr Kotick said that after the deal, Activision would become “an independent company with a best-in-class franchise portfolio and the focus and flexibility to drive long-term shareholder value and expand our leadership position as one of the world’s most important entertainment companies”.Both deals were struck at a 10 per cent discount to Activision’s share price on Thursday.The Activision agreement follows Vivendi’s announcement this week that it had entered into exclusive talks with Etisalat of Abu Dhabi to sell its Maroc Telecom subsidiary for €4.2bn.“This has been an eventful week,” said Mr Capron. “We are happy that we are seeing the buses coming to the station even if they are all coming together.”Questioned about the Activision discount, he said: “It had to be made sure that every one of the interested parties got to see the interest in this deal.”He added that Vivendi’s board had voted unanimously in favour of the move and also stressed that the deal’s structure meant that the group would face an insignificant tax bill – something that would not have been the case had it opted to sell shares on the open market.
56;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-07-26T16:29:44Z;Vivendi: Blizzard of deals;Sale of majority stake in Activision is a good start, but big decisions lie ahead;Now that is what you call a big week at the office. As Jean-François Dubos settles into his armchair this weekend, the chairman of French conglomerate Vivendi can reflect on a week that will do much to answer the company’s critics. On Monday, Vivendi telecoms subsidiary SFR said it was in talks over a network sharing deal with rival Bouygues. Deutsche Bank thinks a deal could knock 10 per cent off SFR’s operating costs. On Tuesday came news that Vivendi was in talks to sell its majority stake in Maroc Telecom for €4.2bn. Friday brought the pièce de résistance, a deal to sell most of its stake in computer games maker Activision Blizzard for €6.2bn.One could grumble about some aspects of the deal. In particular, the $13.60 per share Vivendi will get for its majority stake in Activision Blizzard (producer of World of Warcraft) is a 10 per cent discount to Thursday’s closing price. But the disposals are indisputably a step in the right direction. The €10.4bn potentially raised would erase most of Vivendi’s €13.2bn of net debt, soothing fears about its credit rating, and making room, should Vivendi be so inclined, for buybacks or higher dividends. Put together, the three moves represent solid progress from a company that has been accused of slowness about restructuring.But the really big decision looms ahead. After this week’s deals, Vivendi will consist of two media companies – TV operator Canal+ and Universal Music – along with SFR and GVT, a Brazilian telecoms operator. Vivendi sees its future in media and content (notwithstanding its decision to sell a big chunk of a computer games business) so the telecoms companies look surplus to requirements. A sale process for GVT got nowhere earlier this year, but it is likely to return.A separation from SFR is the bigger prize and a feasibility study is under way. Macquarie gives Vivendi a sum of the parts valuation of €20 per share, a hefty premium to the current €16.1. But unlocking that valuation will not be straightforward, as demonstrated by Vivendi’s decision to accept a discount price for its Activision Blizzard stake. No time to play Guitar Hero Mr Dubos. There is still work to be done.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
57;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
58;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Activision chief leads $8.2bn investor buyout;;Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, is leading an $8.2bn investor buyout of most of Vivendi’s controlling stake in the world’s largest video games company.The group behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft will use about $1.2bn in cash and roughly $4.6bn of debt to buy 429m shares from Vivendi, the French entertainment and telecoms company which holds a 61 per cent stake in Activision.It will buy the shares for $5.83bn, or $13.60 per share. An investor group led by Mr Kotick and Activision’s co-chairman, Brian Kelly, will buy a further 172m shares at the same price for about $2.34bn in cash.The two deals – priced at a 10 per cent discount to Activision’s $15.18 closing price on Thursday – will leave Vivendi with 83m shares, or about a 12 per cent stake.Mr Kotick, Mr Kelly and other investors that include Davis Advisors, Leonard Green & Partners and Tencent, Activision’s partner in China, will hold about 24.9 per cent. Mr Kotick and Mr Kelly will invest a combined $100m.The transactions will allow Vivendi to reap substantial tax benefits. They will also hand the Paris-based company cash to pay down a large chunk of its €13.2bn of net debt, which has been a source of concern for shareholders.Earlier this week, Vivendi said it had entered exclusive talks with Etisalat, the Abu Dhabi-based telecoms group, to sell its stake in Maroc Telecom for €4.2bn.The transactions send a clear signal that Vivendi is at last making progress in its efforts to carry out a sweeping restructuring announced a year ago, under pressure from investors who want its board to simplify the group.“Like London buses, you have to wait for ages at the bus stop and then two come along at once,” Citi wrote in a research note. “So it is with deal flow at Vivendi.”Vivendi shares hit €16.48 in morning trading on Friday, a jump of more than 3 per cent compared with Thursday’s close.Activision said it would also acquire “certain tax attributes” from Vivendi, such as the ability to use past losses to reduce taxes on future profits. It predicted that the deal would boost pro forma earnings per share this year by 18-29 per cent on a GAAP basis and by 23-33 per cent on the non-GAAP basis the company uses for its internal planning.In a statement, Mr Kotick said the deals represented “a tremendous opportunity for Activision Blizzard and all its shareholders, including Vivendi”.He added that Activision, maker of the Diablo and Skylanders franchises, would become “an independent company with a best-in-class franchise portfolio and the focus and flexibility to drive long-term shareholder value and expand our leadership position as one of the world’s most important entertainment companies”.The transaction was agreed at a board meeting in California on Thursday at which Activision was represented by a committee of independent directors.Jean-Francois Dubos, chairman of Vivendi’s management board, said the deal represented “an important step forward” in the strategic review it began last year. Philippe Capron, chairman of Activision and chief financial officer of Vivendi, emphasised the deal’s “massively accretive impact for minority shareholders”.Activision said it had committed financing from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan, and expected the deal to close by the end of September. It will emerge with about $1.4bn of net debt.The agreement came soon after Vivendi gained new powers to force Activision to take on debt and pay out a sizeable dividend.Standard & Poor’s had not taken into account Activision’s cash in its triple B rating of Vivendi, so the cash from selling most of its stake could boost the French group’s credit rating.Bobby Kotick always liked his independence, and he now has the chance to regain it, writes John GapperSince announcing a strategic review last year, it has tried to sell GVT, its Brazilian telecoms business, and examined options including a spin-off for SFR, France’s second-largest mobile operator, as it seeks instead to focus on its entertainment assets.The most prominent of these now are Universal Music, the world’s largest music company, and Canal+, the French pay-television business. Last week, it emerged that Vivendi had turned down an $8.5bn approach for Universal from SoftBank of Japan.Mr Kotick became chief executive of Activision in 1991. In 2008, he oversaw the combination of its portfolio of titles for consoles and handheld devices with Blizzard, the Vivendi-owned games business with strengths in PC and online subscription games.The video games industry is preparing for the introduction this year of new Xbox and PlayStation consoles from Microsoft and Sony that some analysts expect will be the last generation of games consoles. Console games accounted for 43 per cent of Activision’s sales last year.The company on Thursday raised its full-year GAAP revenue outlook from $4.22bn to $4.31bn. It said earnings per diluted share would be 77 cents, rather than its previous guidance of 73 cents. Activision reported revenues of $4.86bn for 2012, with net income of $1.15bn.Activision shares closed down 21 cents at $15.18 on Thursday, valuing its equity at about $17bn. The stock is up 43 per cent this year, but it has underperformed some competitors. Vivendi’s shares are down almost 6 per cent since the start of the year.Activision was advised by JPMorgan and Skadden, Arps. Vivendi was advised by Barclays and Goldman Sachs. The independent directors were advised by Centerview Partners and Wachtell, Lipton.

59;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-07-23T16:37:14Z;Vivendi in €4.2bn Maroc Telecom stake sale talks with Etisalat;;Vivendi, the French media and telecoms conglomerate, said on Tuesday that it had entered into exclusive talks with Etisalat to sell its stake in Maroc Telecom for €4.2bn.The talks with the Abu Dhabi-based operator brings Vivendi a step closer to completing its first big asset sale since Jean-Bernard Lévy, its former chief executive, left the company last year after differences with the board.Since then, investors have been pressing Jean-René Fourtou, Vivendi’s chairman, to execute the deep changes that he flagged since announcing a “strategic review” last July.Mr Fourtou, 74, and Vivendi’s new management plan to turn the Paris-based group – which has interests spreading from television and music to telecoms and video games – into a leaner, more focused company.Vivendi owns Universal Music Group as well as Canal Plus, the French pay-TV company – two companies that analysts believe could form a more coherent core of a smaller and more slender Vivendi.But, until Tuesday’s announcement, investors had seen little change, and the company’s attempts to sell assets, including GVT, the Brazilian telecoms company, have so far failed to materialise.According to a statement early on Tuesday, Etisalat’s offer values Vivendi’s 53 per cent stake of Maroc Telecom at 92.6 Moroccan dirhams a share, which would hand Vivendi €4.2bn in cash from the sale, including a 2012 dividend of €310m.Vivendi said that the two sides intend to close the sale before the end of this year, pending regulatory approvals.News of the exclusive talks came a day after SFR, Vivendi’s wholly owned telecoms provider, said that it had entered into discussions with Bouygues Telecom, to share part of their mobile phone networks.The two telecoms companies, the second and third biggest in France by number of subscribers, said that they hoped to reach an agreement by year-end that would allow them to expand geographically and to invest more efficiently in very-high-speed networks.Shares in Vivendi closed up 2.4 per cent on Tuesday at €16.08.
60;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Vivendi spurned $8.5bn Universal Music bid;SoftBank offer for music business rejected;SoftBank, the Japanese telecoms group, proposed an $8.5bn bid for Universal Music, the world’s largest music group, about three months ago but was turned down, according to several people familiar with the proposal.Vivendi, Universal’s French owner, has been under pressure to restructure its portfolio of telecoms and media assets but told SoftBank it was not interested because it saw the music company as central to its future strategy, these people said.Vivendi and SoftBank declined to comment.An $8.5bn offer, premised on the idea that music is some of the most heavily-consumed content on mobile devices, would value Universal at $2bn to $3bn above most analyst estimates.Claudio Aspesi of Bernstein Research, who values Universal at $6.3bn, said the premium underscored the attractiveness of the asset but “will only add to the frustration of [Vivendi] shareholders”.Vincent Bolloré, the French activist investor, has built a 5 per cent stake in Vivendi and shareholders have been pressing for a faster pace of disposals since Jean-René Fourtou, its chairman, began a review of its businesses after Jean-Bernard Levy’s sudden exit as chief executive last June.SoftBank’s all-cash proposal was put to Vivendi’s board, one person familiar with the details said, and was not contingent on the outcome of the Japanese group’s $21.6bn bid for control of Sprint, the US mobile operator.The message that Universal Music is not for sale fits with Vivendi’s strategy of trying to sell its telecoms holdings and regroup around entertainment assets, which comprise Universal and majority stakes in French TV group Canal Plus and Activision Blizzard, the US video games company.Some analysts have argued that a full break-up would create most value, however. After failed attempts to sell Activision and GVT, its Brazilian telecoms company, it is in talks to sellMaroc Telecom to Etisalat and has been examining ways to extract cash from Activision.It is unclear whether SoftBank would still have the capacity for an $8.5bn music bid after sweetening its offer for Sprint in June. Its shares have doubled to a 13-year high since it announced the Sprint offer in October, but Standard & Poor’s this month cut Softbank’s credit rating to junk when it won the Sprint auction.Analysts disagree over whether SoftBank could find meaningful synergy benefits in a combination with a music company. Some highlighted the growth of mobile music consumption but others pointed to failed past attempts at similar synergies, saying that owning one music company could make it harder to get rivals to work with any SoftBank music service.Dan Loeb, the activist investor, has urged Sony to consider a partial spin-off of its entertainment assets after years of struggling to find synergies with its electronics business.Vivendi has guided analysts to expect improvements in Universal’s profitability as the division led by Lucian Grainge integrates the recorded music assets it bought in last year’s EMI auction.It was not clear whether Mr Bolloré played any role in Vivendi’s decision. The French group’s shares have fallen 13 per cent since early May to stand below their level of a year ago, but Mr Aspesi said Mr Bolloré’s buying had provided support to the stock.Mr Son played no part in recent auctions for Warner Music, EMI and EMI’s Parlophone label, and many had thought that the size of Universal, home to The Beatles and Justin Bieber, would put it beyond the reach of most bidders.
61;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-07-10T19:25:17Z;Inside Business: Malone hitches up to broadband bandwagon;Malone is on the prowl for acquisitions;"Five years ago, reporters covering Allen & Co’s annual Sun Valley summit were scrambling around the floor of the lodge where the world’s media and technology leaders gather each July, helping Rupert Murdoch look for his wedding ring.The News Corp chairman filed for divorce last month and the press is now kept at a distance, but otherwise Sun Valley’s rituals are little changed as Herb Allen’s guests regroup near Idaho’s Sawtooth mountains this week.Each sighting of two “media moguls” or “tech titans” talking sparks speculation about what deal they might be discussing. This year, the 286 male and 17 female guests jetted in laden with expectations that they would, for example, sort out Apple’s television strategy; Vivendi’s plans for its Activision stake; and Hulu’s buyer.Sun Valley’s reputation as a hotbed of dealmaking is exaggerated but with dealmaking central to its legend, nobody is more in focus this week than Liberty Media’s John Malone.His companies have been involved in some of this year’s biggest deals, buying Virgin Media in the UK for $23.3bn, taking a stake in Dutch cable operator Ziggo, tussling with Vodafone over Kabel Deutschland and spending $2.6bn for 27 per cent of Charter Communications, the fourth-largest US cable operator.He is looking for the next target already. Last month, he touted Charter as “a horizontal acquisition machine”, saying that consolidation could balance out an industry he likened to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, where too many sub-scale groups trail behind Comcast.Mr Malone is not one to enjoy playing the dwarf, so Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chief executive, has begun pitching Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, on a deal with Charter. TWC has three times Charter’s subscribers and more than double its enterprise value, and Mr Britt – another Sun Valley guest – seems unconvinced so far.The deal would test Mr Malone’s financial engineering talents, requiring some combination of a dilutive issue of new equity from the highly-rated Charter, an infusion of cash from elsewhere in Liberty’s portfolio, leverage of perhaps five times earnings on the combined company’s balance sheet and a creative use of Charter’s historic tax losses.Liberty may yet pick smaller targets instead, but scale counts in cable. Morgan Stanley estimates a combined Charter-TWC could yield annual savings of $400m-$600m, largely from greater negotiating power with programme suppliers.Consolidation in the fragmented US pay-TV market looks inevitable, and for it to be led by the man who built America’s largest cable company before selling TCI to AT&T in 1999 might seem poetic.Forget the nostalgia, though. Mr Malone’s plans have little to do with what cable was when he earned his “cable cowboy” nickname. “We keep looking at these personalities, but just as important is the business logic [of] becoming the largest TV and broadband distributor,” says Michael J Wolf, managing director at Activate, a strategy consultancy.We keep looking at these personalities, but just as important is the business logic [of] becoming the largest TV and broadband distributorBroadband is the key to Mr Malone’s renewed interest in cable. With profit margins under pressure in video, high-speed connectivity is cable’s growth story.Mr Malone said at his annual meeting last month he is betting that broadband will be “the controlling attribute that drives market share”, even in video, as more programming is delivered “over the top” via internet connections rather than cable or satellite boxes.He sees cable as uniquely positioned to deliver the bandwidth needed by services like Netflix and the cheaper video packages cable companies will offer if they can “unbundle” costly sports channels.But what kind of broadband cowboy would Mr Malone be? He says his vision includes more tiered pricing and charging bandwidth-hungry users of cable’s pipes (such as Netflix) for the capacity they use.Short-term opportunism is mixed in Mr Malone’s long-term vision. Consumer advocates already warn that tiered pricing and usage-based billing will hurt the “little guys”, and we should not assume he can simply replicate his buccaneering cable days. Cable companies now face cord-cutting consumers and competition from the Netflix, satellite and telecom groups, Mr Wolf notes.Even if Mr Malone is just defending his power base this time, however, he seems determined to play a central role in shaping the future of internet access in America and beyond.

62;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Vivendi mulls raid on Activision’s balance sheet;;Vivendi is exploring how to extract cash from its Activision Blizzard subsidiary after discussions with the games maker to sell part of its holding in the business have fallen apart, according to people close to the talks.The French media-to-telecoms group had been engaged in discussions with Activision that could have led to a sale of part of its 61 per cent stake in the company behind such games as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. Under these talks, one option being entertained was a tender offer by Activision for part of this holding funded by cash on the games maker’s balance sheet or even through a debt offering.The talks formed part of the group’s wide-ranging strategic review, through which it is also looking to sell its capital-intensive telecoms holdings to cut debt and regroup around its content assets, most notably Universal Music, home to artists such as Justin Bieber and Rihanna. Vivendi is currently in active discussions to sell its Maroc Telecom subsidiary to Etisalat, the Abu Dhabi state telecoms company.The exploration of a cash payout from Activision comes at a crucial time as, from Tuesday, Vivendi gains new powers to force the payment of a sizeable dividend from the games maker. These new powers could be a key bargaining chip in any future negotiations, analysts believe.Current rules require Vivendi to secure the support of Activision’s independent directors ahead of any dividend payment that takes the division’s net debt above $400m. However, these rules expire from Tuesday, meaning that Vivendi can gear up Activision’s balance sheet considerably and force the payout of a special dividend without the approval of independent directors.The games maker has net cash of $4.6bn. But some analysts believe Vivendi could look to raise the games maker’s borrowings to as much as $5bn and compel a leveraged dividend payout.Vivendi is currently rated triple B, the second-lowest investment grade, on negative outlook by S&P, partly reflecting the fact that the rating agency does not take into account the cash on Activision’s balance sheet. A sizeable dividend payout could therefore improve Vivendi’s rating.But Giasone Salati, analyst at Espirito Santo, believes a leveraged dividend looks unlikely as it does not solve the key challenges facing Vivendi.“There are two problems at Vivendi. One, the operational issues at some divisions like SFR [its mobile operator in France] and Maroc Telecom and two, that it is suffering from a conglomerate discount,” he said. “Gearing up to pay a dividend at Activision Blizzard therefore looks unlikely as it would solve neither of these issues.”But analysts concede that the threat of a geared dividend from Activision could be used as a lever to push the games group to respond with a tender offer for part of Vivendi’s stake at above-market prices.Vivendi has urged investors to be patient over its strategic review, begun in spring last year. Last March, the group suspended the sale of GVT, its fast-growing Brazilian fixed-line telecoms company, after bidders failed to meet price expectations.Vivendi declined to comment and Activision Blizzard could not be reached for comment.
63;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-03-22T15:02:58Z;Letter from Lex – crossing the green line;As scientists reveal more information about the Big Bang, Cyprus sets the EU on a path towards implosion;Scientists revealed this week that 13.8bn years ago the universe inflated a trillion trillion trillion times in the blink of an eye during the Big Bang. Cyprus’s proposed bailout did not have quite as large an impact, but it did send loud reverberations rattling through markets. Fortunately the island’s lawmakers balked at the principle of imposing a one-off levy on bank depositors of all sizes, but the eurozone crisis is front and centre once again. Cyprus’s beleaguered banks can only look with envy at India’s HDFC and Indonesia’s Bank Central Asia, the most expensive banks in the world. Meanwhile in the US, products at the heart of the financial crisis made a return as JPMorgan planned the sale of private label mortgage bonds.In the corporate sphere, tech and consumer goods dominated. Blackstone was considering muscling in on Michael Dell’s attempt to take the company he founded private while Adobe continued its slow shift to selling software subscription services. Meanwhile, in Europe, two semiconductor-related companies experienced contrasting fortunes. The chief executive of chip designer Arm Holdings will step down this summer after quadrupling revenues and quintupling profits during his tenure. In the face of such stiff competition, Ericsson and STMicro decided to break-up their lossmaking chip joint venture. The CEO of video games maker Electronic Arts also lost out to a formidable rival in the form of Activision Blizzard as he was forced to step down after six years at the helm. The same fate should have befallen some members of the board of the world’s largest computer maker, Hewlett-Packard, but they somehow survived a shareholder protest vote. Finally, Oracle’s results showed that the corporate IT market may be in worse shape than previously believed.Elsewhere two consumer goods companies were focusing on their supply chains. Cracks started to appear in the impressive growth of high-end yoga clothing manufacturer Lululemon as it revealed that its latest workout gear is too “sheer”. The US’ largest retail pharmacy chain, Walgreens, moved towards vertically integrating its supply chain by signing a 10-year distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen. Two other retailers showed the difference between operating in Europe and Asia these days. Germany’s Metro is struggling to restructure its unwieldy portfolio of businesses while Indonesian department store Matahari was anticipating a successful refloat thanks to the country’s rapidly expanding middle class.Finally, in the oil sector, BP launched an $8bn share buyback after receiving $12.5bn in cash from Rosneft the sale of its stake in TNK-BP. The company best known for operating BP’s ill-fated Gulf of Mexico oil rig, Transocean, decided to return cash to shareholders despite its $11bn debt.John Casey, Lex Publisher
64;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;EA: off its game;Video game pioneer’s mistakes stand out when compared with rival’s success;"Electronic Arts chief executive John Riccitiello has run out of lives. After he held the controller for six years, the video game pioneer announced his departure from EA this week. His tenure saw the rise of Zynga and other mobile and social game makers. But even as these new platforms have proliferated, there remains no substitute for a hit video game whatever the platform or form of distribution.EA, during Riccitiello’s reign, spent more than $1bn buying developers of mobile and social games to keep up with the (unprofitable) leader Zynga. And in the past year, digital revenue, (including both internet download and mobile), grew nearly 40 per cent. Yet physical console games still accounted for 60 per cent of revenue, and sales from the segment fell by a quarter, pushing overall revenue down by a tenth.EA has its share of blockbusters, particularly in sports with their Madden NFL and Fifa franchises – but these require royalties to the sports leagues, so are less profitable than games developed entirely within EA. And while flops and missteps are part of any entertainment business, EA’s mistakes stand out when lined up against the hits that its rival Activision Blizzard has unleashed. Its star performers include the blockbusters World of Warcraft and Call of Duty franchises, the latter being the highest seller of 2012 according to VGChartz, a market research firm. As such, Activision Blizzard boasted revenue growth in 2012 of more than 10 per cent and its operating margin exceeds 30 per cent; EA’s operating margin is below 10 per cent.It is little surprise, then, that Activision’s stock price is up more than 60 per cent since 2009, versus a 10 per cent gain for EA. All this is great if you have been an Activision Blizzard shareholder but today’s hit maker can quickly become tomorrow’s has-been. Just ask EA.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
65;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-02-26T15:43:26Z;Vivendi: unrewarded patience;Progress at French media and telecoms group is slow;It isn’t always better to travel than arrive. France’s Vivendi is a case in point. After last year’s management changes and stakebuilding by Vincent Bolloré, the French company at least has a clearer direction. This involves selling down or “maximising value” on the telecoms side, while strengthening its media and content businesses. But progress is proving slow. So with no news on asset disposals and reports that offers for the Brazilian GVT business have fallen short of best hopes, reaction to Tuesday’s slightly better than expected results for 2012 was muted. Vivendi shares, down 9 per cent this year, barely budged.This may seem a bit unfair. GVT offers are said to have come in under €6bn, compared with the €7bn management would like. But this business pushed up earnings before interest, tax and amortisation by more than a fifth last year to €500m, so there is every reason to extract maximum value. Progress on the potential sale of Vivendi’s 53 per cent stake in Maroc Telecom (market value: €4.5bn) may also become more evident in the next few months.Conversely, though, getting rid of the domestic SFR telecoms business now seems to be off the agenda. And scrutiny of the results shows that positive news within the overall 10 per cent fall in earnings before interest and tax was confined largely to Activision Blizzard (where Vivendi holds 61 per cent) and GVT. By contrast, SFR, exposed to tough competition, saw revenues drop 7 per cent from 2011 levels, while ebitda fell 13 per cent to €3.3bn.Vivendi does not look expensive. Strip out the Activision and Maroc interests at market values, and the rest of the group trades on an enterprise value to 2013 ebitda ratio of about 4 times. Goldman Sachs says that the discount to “sum of the parts” valuation is back towards 30 per cent. Investor patience, though, needs to be rewarded – and soon.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
66;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2013-02-26T08:28:24Z;Vivendi urges patience over assets review;;Vivendi has urged investors to be patient about its long-awaited strategic review and said the French telecoms and media conglomerate would “not be forced into a fire sale of assets”.The comments came as it reported a 14 per cent decline in adjusted net income to €2.55bn last year because of falling earnings at its domestic telephone company SFR and Maroc Telecom, its Moroccan operator.The group is exploring disposals of Maroc and GVT, a fast-growing Brazilian fixed-line telecoms business, but some bankers say this has been held up by political concerns in Morocco and trying to secure a reasonable price for GVT.Commenting on the GVT process, Philippe Capron, Vivendi’s finance director, said: “It has not gone cold, but whether it goes through depends on an appropriate value. GVT is the main growth engine for Vivendi.”He said the company had not received any “binding offers” for Maroc, despite interest from buyers such as Qatar’s Qtel and Etisalat of the United Arab Emirates.Vivendi has also spoken to Numericable, a French cable group, about a possible combination with SFR. But Jean-François Dubos, chief executive, insisted that “SFR is not for sale”.Vivendi wants to sell capital-intensive telecoms holdings to cut debt and regroup around its content assets, notably Universal Music – home to artists such as Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj and Lana Del Rey.However, Mr Capron said its finances were strong enough to avoid “a fire sale”. Net debt at the end of 2012 was €13.4bn, below a targeted €14bn.UBS analysts warned that “if disposals disappoint, investor focus will switch back to weak earnings momentum and a limited credit rating headroom”.Vivendi’s management is helped by the fact that Vincent Bolloré, the billionaire investor who has acquired a 5 per cent stake, has said he is willing to take a long-term view.Nevertheless, analysts still hope for news on disposals ahead of April’s annual meeting, which takes place a year after it first embarked on the “no taboos” strategic review.The net income decline is evidence of the damage being done to SFR’s profits by a French price war, sparked by the launch of an ultra low-cost mobile rival by Iliad.Vivendi expected SFR earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to be close to €2.9bn this year, down from €3.3bn in 2012. SFR has embarked on a €500m cost-cutting plan and is exploring network-sharing deals with rivals.Stéphane Richard, chief executive of France Telecom, told the Financial Times last week that he thought a network sharing deal between his company and SFR “has some logic”.Vivendi has also considered selling some or all of its stake in Activision Blizzard, maker of World of Warcraft and Call of Duty. The games maker’s ebitda rose 12 per cent in 2012.
67;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Activision Blizzard warns over consoles;;Activision Blizzard, publisher of the video game industry’s biggest franchise, Call of Duty, has warned that the introduction of next-generation consoles could hit its business in 2013, with uncertainty surrounding their success and game development costs increasing.Activision reported record 2012 earnings, driven by sales of Call of Duty: Black Ops II, its Diablo III PC game and Skylanders: Giants, a game that combines with physical toys.“We were somewhat disappointed with the launch of the Wii U [in November] and it’s a challenging environment this year,” Bobby Kotick, chief executive, said. “One of the things we are concerned about is what the installed base [of next-generation consoles] will be like [in 2013].”Nintendo last week lowered its forecast for sales of the Wii U from 5.5m units worldwide to 4m units for its fiscal year ending in March.It lowered software predictions from 24m units being sold to 16m.Sony is expected to reveal details of its successor to the PlayStation 3 at an event in New York on February 20, while Microsoft is expected to launch a follow-up to the Xbox 360 later this year.“In every single console transition, we have seen an increase in development costs,” said Mr Kotick.“It requires new skills and investment in tools and technology and engines, so yes, [cost increases are] likely.”The console transition, combined with a higher expected tax rate, difficult comparisons with the 12m copies sold of Diablo III in 2012 and general macroeconomic uncertainty, led Activision to give guidance for a less successful 2013.It forecast sales would fall from $4.99bn in 2012 to $4.17bn and earnings per share would drop from $1.18 to 80 cents.Analysts had expected revenues to fall to $4.57bn and earnings per share to 98 cents.However, the Los Angeles-based company tends to be conservative in its outlook and did not include in its figures two big new ventures analysts expect to be launched this year.These are a game from the developer Bungie, creator of Microsoft’s Halo franchise, and a version of Call of Duty for China being produced in partnership with the Tencent game company there.Activision gave no indications of launch dates for either and said that, in working with a partner and needing government approvals, some things were beyond its control for the Chinese version of Call of Duty.China also influenced fourth-quarter earnings. The company said subscribers to its World of Warcraft online game declined from 10m to 9.6m, with the majority of lost users coming from China.Fourth-quarter sales of $2.59bn and earnings per share of 78 cents beat Wall Street expectations of $2.44bn and 72 cents respectively.Its shares rose 5 per cent to $12.71 in extended trading on the news.
68;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-25T00:05:50+0000;Newtown puts real heat under virtual guns;Regulators may seek curbs on violent video game content;The Connecticut school shooting that has changed America’s discussion about guns has also put a new twist on another old debate – the extent to which violent films, music, television shows and video games influence gun crime.As Hollywood and television networks postponed, cancelled or re-edited film premieres, TV shows and promotional trailers featuring weapons, Republicans and Democrats alike urged policy makers to re-examine the media’s role.“All for curbing weapons of war. But shouldn’t we also quit marketing murder as a game?” tweeted David Axelrod, one of Barack Obama’s advisers, after watching a “shoot-em-up” video game advertisement.Conservative commentators from Rush Limbaugh to Peggy Noonan warned of an “implosion of our culture” and “a culture of death”, fuelled by the media.The motivations behind the Newtown massacre remain unclear and simplistic explanations are rarely adequate, but reports that the gunman spent hours playing Call of Duty, the Activision Blizzard game, have sharpened the focus on video games.On Wednesday, Senator Jay Rockefeller, the Democratic Senate commerce committee chairman, introduced a bill calling for a study of the effects of violent games and programming on children.Joe Scarborough, the Republican host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, described the concern as follows: “Violent, mind-numbing video games and gruesome Hollywood movies …dangerously desensitise those who struggle with mental health challenges.”There are many holes in the argument that media violence causes real violence. Other countries with tougher gun laws consume just the same entertainment yet suffer a fraction of America’s murders.The business implications of social unease about media violence may also seem unclear. But remember that The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises topped this year’s box office in America, and Amazon’s best-selling video games of 2012 include Halo 4, Call of Duty: Black Ops II and Assassin’s Creed III.Hollywood’s response to Newtown has so far followed a familiar pattern. The Weinstein Company cancelled a premiere of Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino’s latest gun-filled movie, while Paramount recut a trailer of Jack Reacher to remove a scene of Tom Cruise’s character shooting a semi-automatic weapon.The Discovery Channel, which had quietly not renewed its American Guns reality show, said Sons of Guns was now also off the schedule, and NBC Sports pulled its gun shows and advertising “indefinitely”.Entertainment companies are used to dealing with this debate after each mass shooting. After the Columbine school shooting in 1999, the Federal Trade Commission found that film, music and games companies deliberately marketed explicit or violent material to children.Little came of the media violence debate after Columbine, or the Aurora cinema shooting in July. Last year, the US Supreme Court struck down a California attempt to restrict sales of violent games to minors, with Justice Antonin Scalia citing First Amendment protections for free speech and likening games to Grimm’s fairy tales.Mr Tarantino this week similarly said his film followed an old media tradition, saying: “It’s a Western. Give me a break.” That Westerns once ruled America’s TV screens is a reminder that there are fashions in media, even if this one shows little sign of ebbing.The industry’s traditional response to pressure has been to offer clearer age ratings for parents. Enterprising kids could usually find ways around such restrictions, but the debate is changing as the industry shifts from physical media – which, in theory, lets stores check buyers’ ages – to online distribution.Sales of physical video games have been falling for four years. But as Senator Rockefeller said: “Changes in technology now allow kids to access violent content online with less parental involvement.”Entertainment companies “make billions on marketing and selling violent content to children,” he said. If they do not take more responsibility, “you can count on the Congress to take a more aggressive role”.Such comments tap into many parents’ unease about violent entertainment and the industry looks a tempting target for concerned liberals and for gun supporters eager to change the subject.Shares in video game companies from Activision to Take-Two Interactive have fallen since the Newtown shooting.Unless producers of violent content can come up with convincing solutions to the problem of restricting access online, regulators may look to restrict the content itself.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’ media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
69;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-11-16T20:27:55Z;Call of Duty: Black Ops II’s $500m record;;In a week of big numbers for a previously slumping video game industry, Activision has come up with the biggest one of all – $500m in sales of Call of Duty: Black Ops II in its first 24 hours.On Monday, Microsoft announced $220m in first-day sales for Halo 4 and then revealed, on the 10th anniversary of Xbox Live on Thursday, that a record 442m hours were played on it last week. Meanwhile, Sony announced sales of the PlayStation 3 had passed 70m and Nintendo expects the Wii U to sell out when it goes on sale in the US this weekend.Activision said Tuesday’s debut of the latest Call of Duty title was the biggest entertainment launch of the year for the fourth year in succession.“Life-to-date sales for the Call of Duty franchise have exceeded worldwide theatrical box office receipts for Harry Potter and Star Wars, the two most successful movie franchises of all time,” said Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard chief executive.“ Given the challenged macro-economic environment, we remain cautious about the balance of 2012 and 2013,” he added.Analysts at Macquarie Capital noted: “The timing and emphasis of this caution remains a concern, as this type of cautious commentary on [near-term] outlook was not present in prior Call of Duty launch-day press releases.”The industry has been in a funk, with US software sales falling year-on-year by double-digit percentages for 11 straight months. But releases like Black Ops II and Halo will boost the numbers and analysts expect the launch of the Wii U to represent a turnaround in the monthly declines.Scott Moffitt, head of sales and marketing for Nintendo, told me the Wii U was on course to meet the company’s target of selling 5.5m units by the end of its fiscal year in March.“So far we’ve seen incredibly brisk pre-sales, we do expect high demand, but there will be more systems on hand this opening week than was the case for the launch of Wii and replenishment will be more frequent, but I’m guessing we will see some shortages,” he said.Black Ops II is one of a number of hard-core games available on the HD console at launch. The industry has been looking for signs of weakness in the Call of Duty franchise and Activision masked comparisons by making the $500m figure a global one, whereas the $400m in sales for the last Call of Duty title – Modern Warfare 3 – was a US and UK only figure.MW3 had topped the $360m in sales of the first Black Ops, although the game is reported to have gone on to not sell as well as that title.Activision said Modern Warfare 3 made $775m in sales in its first five days globally, so it will be interesting to see if it provides worldwide figures after five days for Black Ops II.Sony said the PlayStation 3 reached 70m unit sales this month, six years after launch. That puts it on a par with the Xbox 360, but well behind the 97m unit sales for the Wii.Sony’s press release, in which it also detailed sales of 15m Move motion controllers and touted successes for the PlayStation Network, seemed a response to Microsoft’s anniversary news on Thursday.As well as the 442m-hours record, Microsoft said the Xbox Live service had on average 9.4m people a week taking part in multi-player gaming. It has more than 40m members in 41 countries.Nintendo says that, with the Wii U, it will be able to offer the same online experience for hard-core gamers as on Xbox and PS3, but it has a long way to go to match these numbers.
70;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-11-13T21:02:27Z;Video games help Vivendi lift income target;;Vivendi, the French entertainment and telecoms conglomerate, has increased its adjusted net income target to €2.7bn for 2012 as it benefits from strong sales of video games at Activision Blizzard, the maker of World of Warcraft and Call of Duty.However, the company, which is engaged in a root and branch review of its various holdings, said earnings before interest, tax and amortisation fell 7 per cent in the third quarter of the year, in part because of a fierce mobile phone price war affecting SFR, its domestic French telecoms business.Vivendi parted company with its chief executive at the end of June because of a divergence over its strategic direction.The company is examining the possible sale or spin-off of its three telecoms companies: SFR, Morocco’s Maroc Telecom and Brazil’s GVT.But Philippe Capron, finance director, on Tuesday declined to provide more details. “First we’ll define a strategy, then we can think about possible asset sales,” he said. The company also explored a possible sale of its controlling stake in Activision, although found it difficult to find buyers willing to meet its price.Vivendi indicated that the decline in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation at SFR would probably be at the better end of its expectations, which has been for a decline of between 12 and 15 per cent.The company is engaged in talks about a possible merger of SFR with Numericable, a private equity-owned French cable group.
71;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Returning gamers lift Activision profits;;Activision Blizzard, the biggest video game publisher by revenues, reported earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations as players returned to its World of Warcraft online game.The Santa Monica-based company also raised its outlook for the year and predicted its latest Call of Duty game, out next week, would be “one of the most successful launches of any form of entertainment in history”.Activision has bucked the trend of rapidly declining video game software sales with the strength of its long-running World of Warcraft and Call of Duty franchises, as well as success with newer titles such as Diablo III and the toy-related Skylanders series.It reported third-quarter revenues of $751m and earnings per share of 15 cents, beating an analyst consensus of $708m and 8 cents. Net income almost doubled to $168m from $87m a year earlier.A trend of declining World of Warcraft subscribers was reversed, with the company reporting numbers had risen to more than 10m by September 30, up from 9.1m in the second quarter. They were boosted by the release late in the quarter of the Mists of Pandaria expansion title for the online world, which sold 2.7m copies in its first week.“Players are coming back,” Bobby Kotick, chief executive, told the Financial Times.“People have tried other things, but Mists has done a very good job of getting people energised again about the game.”Activision says people took a break from Warcraft to play Diablo III, another successful online game, released in May.The company predicted $2.4bn in revenues and earnings of 70 cents a share for the final three months of the year, by far the biggest quarter for the game industry due to the holiday season. It raised its guidance for the full year from $4.6bn to $4.8bn in revenues and to earnings per share of $1.10 from 99 cents.Call of Duty: Black Ops II was off to a successful start in pre-orders, said Mr Kotick.“It’s likely going to be the most successful Call of Duty ever. I think audiences are going to be excited about it and that was part of the basis for our increasing the outlook for the year.”He added that the Wii U, a next-generation console from Nintendo launching next week, was unlikely to give an immediate boost to Activision’s revenues, even though he expected it to sell out during the holiday season.Activision said $427m or 57 per cent of third-quarter revenues came from digital channels such as subscriptions, down from 62 per cent a year earlier.Activision shares rose 1.5 per cent in after-market trading to $11.30 on Wednesday following the release of the results. The shares are down nearly 20 per cent over the past year, with the industry in a slump as it nears the end of the current generation of home consoles.
72;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-10-16T14:17:34Z;Vivendi – billionaire on board;Vincent Bolloré may bring some much-needed changes;Courage, mes braves. Vincent Bolloré’s increased stake in France’s Vivendi – which now tops 5 per cent – is hardly a surprise. Nor is Vivendi’s confirmation that the energetic investor will be offered a board seat at the media-cum-telecoms group. Still, Mr Bolloré does have a well-established reputation for engineering changes. So fellow Vivendi shareholders may hope that his increased presence will produce a solution to the company’s split-personality, structural dilemma sooner rather than later.They should remain realistic, though. April’s strategic review made clear that nothing was taboo, to the discomfort of some bondholders. Former chief executive Jean-Bernard Lévy, closely associated with the telecoms business, departed in June. As the stream of rumours about potential disposals makes clear, assets are being actively scrutinised. If deals were easy and attractive, they would probably have announced by now. In reality, most mooted possibilities have faced difficulties. The latest – blending SFR, Vivendi’s domestic telecoms business, with French cable company Numericable, with Vivendi taking 49 per cent and Numericable’s private equity owners 51 per cent – is a case in point. The extent of the synergies is debatable. A more fundamental issue is the imbalance in the two companies’ values: perhaps €14bn at SFR versus €4bn at Numericable. A big cash payment to Vivendi – say €4bn-plus – could even things up, but would be glaringly at odds with the €7.8bn that Vivendi paid Vodafone for 44 per cent of SFR just last year.Selling interests in Maroc Telecom or GVT might be more feasible near-term, but neither looks easy. Once the US-listed Activision stake is stripped out, Vivendi’s enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio is less than 5. The scope for advance remains clear. The timing less so.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
73;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-10-14T14:03:58Z;Vivendi in SFR telecoms merger talks;;Vivendi is in talks about a multibillion-euro merger of its SFR telecoms business with Numericable, a deal that would combine France’s second-biggest mobile phone operator with one of the country’s biggest cable groups.Negotiations between Numericable’s owners and Vivendi, the French media and telecoms conglomerate that is engaged in a root-and-branch review of its various holdings, started in recent weeks, said people close to the discussions.They stressed the conversation was still highly preliminary and just one of several options being considered by Vivendi. Some analysts estimate SFR is worth about €15bn and Numericable, which is owned by private equity groups Carlyle, Cinven and Altice, is worth €4bn-€5bn.The proposal being discussed would see both companies merged into a new entity, with Vivendi holding 49 per cent of the shares and Numericable’s owners receiving 51 per cent.Because SFR is worth far more than Numericable, people close to the talks said any deal would need to include a large cash payment, estimated by some to be at least €4bn.Vivendi, Numericable, Carlyle, Cinven and Altice declined to comment.The willingness of Vivendi to examine the early stage proposal reflects its desire to raise cash and cut its exposure to the capital-intensive telecoms business.The group embarked on its “no taboo” strategic review in April this year after a domestic price war in its telecoms business damaged profits at SFR and led to a sharp fall in its shares.Disagreements over the strategic shift led to the departure in June of Jean-Bernard Lévy, the former chief executive who was closely associated with telecoms.Vivendi has also engaged bankers to examine a possible sale of GVT, its Brazilian fixed-line telephone company, and its controlling stake in Maroc Telecom, Morocco’s biggest telecoms operator.Vivendi’s directors have said asset sale proceeds would be used to pay down €14bn of net debt. They have also said the company is on target for underlying earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of at least €2.5bn this year and that they are in “no hurry” to sell.People close to the company say it could be “weeks or months” before an announcement is made on its new structure. Jean-René Fourtou, the chairman who took control after Mr Lévy’s departure, is known to favour media.Vivendi owns Universal Music Group, Canal Plus, a French pay-TV operator, and Activision Blizzard, the video games maker. It explored a sale of Activision, although buyers were put off by its high price.The initial private equity approach for SFR was first reported in the Financial Times last week. Vodafone has also been linked as a possible trade buyer.Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan are advising Numericable, while BNP Paribas and Goldman Sachs are advising Vivendi.

Nexon claims to have invented 11 years ago the “freemium” business model of making games free to play and then charging players for additional virtual items.“Today we believe this is the future of the industry and that there will ultimately be limited if any other business models besides that,” Owen Mahoney, a former EA executive who is Nexon’s chief financial officer, said in a Financial Times interview.“The science of getting people to buy a $60, 60-hour game experience on a DVD in a box is a very hard thing to do. In our view, it’s a broken or really challenged business model.”Nexon’s experience in Korea – its original base – and Japan has been that physical goods have disappeared as broadband speeds have increased dramatically – allowing rapid digital downloads of games as well as rich online gameplay.It sees the same thing happening in the US and Europe – territories it considers “emerging markets” – as speeds increase.That could take some time, however. Currently half of its revenues come from China, with North America contributing only about 7 per cent, or $80m in its last fiscal year, generated from online PC games such as Maple Story.NCsoft’s Guild Wars 2 will cost $60 for an initial digital download of the game, but promises years of unrestricted online play without the need to pay further fees. Its predecessor, released in 2005, sold more than 7m copies.“We see in the industry a real hunger from players to try something new and different and that’s what we’re trying to deliver for them, so I think we will see a lot of interest from existing MMO players in Guild Wars 2,” said Mike O’Brien, president of its developer ArenaNet, in a FT interview.Activision Blizzard announced this month that global World of Warcraft subscribers fell sharply to 9.1m from 10.2m during its past quarter.EA cut the price of its Star Wars: The Old Republic game to $15 from $60 three weeks ago and will introduce a free-to-play option from November after it saw total subscriber numbers dip below 1m in its past quarter.
75;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-08-20T19:08:09Z;Vivendi names Charlier to telecoms post;;Vivendi has recruited Jean-Yves Charlier, former chief executive of Colt Telecom and former head of BT’s European operations, to oversee its disparate group of international telecoms businesses as it ponders large-scale asset disposals or spin-offs.The French conglomerate has also appointed Bertrand Méheut, head of Canal Plus, its French pay-TV company, to take charge of a strategic review of its media and content operations, which also include the Universal Music Group and Activision Blizzard, the games maker.Mr Charlier, chief executive of the interactive learning company Promethean, will conduct a similar task at the company’s three telecoms businesses: SFR of France, Brazil’s GVT and Maroc Telecom.The appointments are the latest step taken by Jean-René Fourtou, Vivendi’s chairman, as he conducts a full-scale reassessment of the company’s structure.Some industry insiders speculated that the tasks assigned to Mr Charlier and Mr Meheut could amount to job interviews for the future role of Vivendi’s chief executive. Jean-Francois Dubos, the group’s secretary, is currently acting as chief executive following the sudden departure of Jean-Bernard Lévy at the end of June.Vivendi has hired bankers to examine ways of raising money from assets such as Activision and GVT, while Maroc Telecom is another candidate. But it could also pursue a split of its media and telecoms businesses.The company has been criticised by some investors who say Vivendi’s market value is far below the value of its individual assets. However, its shares have risen 12 per cent since it parted company with Mr Lévy because of a disagreement over the strategic overhaul.Vivendi also said that Stéphane Roussel has been appointed as permanent chief executive of SFR after taking temporary charge. SFR is in a damaging domestic price war with a mobile operator, Free, which forced Vivendi to slash its dividend and launch a cost-cutting programme earlier this year.
76;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Vivendi cold on €8bn Activision sale;;Vivendi, the French media and telecoms group, has gone cold on the idea of a swift sale of its $8bn stake in Activision Blizzard, a US maker of video games including Call of Duty.Several people close to the situation said bankers for the group had made initial approaches to potential buyers but, after failing to rouse interest at a high enough price, Vivendi was now unlikely to proceed with a sale in the near term.Microsoft, private equity funds, and Activision chief executive Bobby Kotick had been among those thought to be interested, but no satisfactory offers emerged, some of those people said.Industry experts have warned that Activision’s size, at a market value of more than $13bn, could make it difficult to find bidders for Vivendi’s 60 per cent stake.Activision Blizzard announced second-quarter profits well ahead of Wall Street expectations on Thursday, with sales boosted by the success of its Diablo III online role playing PC game.Earnings of 20 cents a share compared with an analyst consensus of 12 cents. Sales of $1.05bn beat Wall Street forecasts of $832m.However, Blizzard, which was part of Vivendi before it was merged with Activision, saw its more established online game, World of Warcraft, suffer a drop of just over 10 per cent in subscribers. They fell to 9.1m from 10.2m in the first quarter – suggesting some degree of cannibalisation from the Diablo game.While no formal decisions have been made, one of the people close to the situation said the idea of a quick sale had been shelved in favour of a broader review of the group in the autumn.“Vivendi has bigger issues than Activision,” the person said. These include the need to gain regulatory approval for the £1.2bn bid by its Universal Music Group for EMI’s recorded music division, as well as €765m in damages Vivendi has to pay to Liberty Media in a case dating back to a decade ago, when the two companies struck a $10.3bn TV network deal.A sale of Vivendi’s Brazilian broadband operator GVT, acquired for €2.8bn, or Maroc Telecom, are also being examined, people familiar with the company’s thinking said.Vivendi declined to comment on “speculation”. It said a strategic review of the company’s structure was ongoing but “there is no hurry”. Jean-René Fourtou, Vivendi’s chairman, is looking at where to set the “boundaries” of the conglomerate because investors believe Vivendi’s share price has lagged far behind the value of its various assets. It could consider a split between its media and telecoms businesses if asset sales are not pursued.Vivendi’s share price has risen by more than 10 per cent since it parted company in June with Jean-Bernard Lévy, its former chief executive, because of a disagreement over the strategy. This has eased the pressure for immediate action.Vivendi’s deliberations have been complicated by tougher than expected regulatory scrutiny of the EMI bid.Universal has offered to sell more than two-thirds of EMI’s recorded music assets in Europe. However, it remains unclear whether the European Commission will accept the concessions, or whether US antitrust authorities could demand similar sacrifices.Universal has been in talks with potential bidders for labels such as Parlophone and Chrysalis UK, but investors will not know whether the larger than expected disposals would undermine the financial case for the deal until they see how much bidders offer. Universal had promised savings of at least €100m from the deal.Competitors are expected to submit their comments on the proposed concessions by the end of this week, and the European Commission is expected to rule on whether they are sufficient or not by the end of next week.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall
77;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-08-02T21:10:29Z;Diablo sequel a blessing for Activision;;Activision Blizzard has announced profits well ahead of Wall Street expectations, with sales boosted by the success of its Diablo III online role-playing PC game.The leading video game publisher by revenues reported second-quarter profits of 20 cents a share compared to an analyst consensus of 12 cents. Sales of $1.05bn beat Wall Street forecasts of $832m.Activision’s Blizzard division released Diablo III on May 15 and the company said it had attracted 10m players by the end of July.“It did really well and it could be the bestselling PC game of all time,” Bobby Kotick, chief executive, told the FT.However, Blizzard’s more established online game, World of Warcraft, suffered a drop of just over 10 per cent in subscribers– to 9.1m from 10.2m in the first quarter – suggesting some degree of cannibalisation from the Diablo game.On Tuesday, Activision’s rival Electronic Arts reported subscribers to its Star Wars: The Old Republic online game fell below 1m in the last quarter and that it would change its business model to offer a free-to-play version.Activision expects World of Warcraft to be boosted by new content in a September software release called Mists of Pandaria.The Santa Monica, California-based company said it had the top three bestselling games in North America and Europe in the first six months of the year, with Skylanders Spyro’s Adventures, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo III.It is optimistic about the prospects for the sequels Skylanders Giants and Call of Duty: Black Ops II in the second half and it raised its guidance for the year above analysts forecasts.It predicted profits of 99 cents per share on revenues of $4.63bn, ahead of Wall Street’s 98 cents on $4.59bn.“While we are increasing our financial outlook for full year 2012, we remain cautious given economic uncertainty, risks to consumer spending especially during the holiday season and the recognition that the majority of our key franchise launches are still ahead of us,” said Mr Kotick in a statement.Activision Blizzard shares closed 0.5 per cent lower ahead of the earnings report, then fell 2.7 per cent afterward to $11.45.
78;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;French regulator approves Bolloré TV deal;;"France’s competition authority has given a green light to a deal that will allow billionaire investor Vincent Bolloré to raise to 5 per cent his stake in Vivendi, the media and telecoms group that is in the midst of a strategic rethink.Mr Bolloré, with a long record as a corporate raider, is poised to become one of Vivendi’s biggest investors when the group’s Canal Plus pay television unit completes the €468m purchase of two Bolloré Group free television channels, Direct 8 and Direct Star, using Vivendi shares.The competition authority said on Monday it had approved the acquisition after Canal Plus had agreed to a number of conditions limiting the use of major sports and French and US film content on the free channels.Its decision is expected to be followed by a similar approval by the broadcast regulator CSA in September, the final hurdle to a deal that should allow Mr Bolloré, with interests ranging from advertising to electric car battery technology, to take up a seat on the Vivendi board later in the year.Mr Bolloré, soon to be flush with cash from a capital gain of €450m from the sale of his share in Aegis, the UK advertising group, to Dentsu of Japan, is understood to be backing Jean-René Fourtou, the Vivendi chairman who is overseeing a strategic review of the group following the ouster last month of Jean-Bernard Lévy as chief executive.Vivendi is under pressure to restructure from investors unhappy over a big reversal in its shares over the past year.As well as Canal Plus, Vivendi owns Universal Music, currently battling regulators over its £1.2bn takeover bid for EMI’s recorded music business; mobile phone operations in Morocco, Brazil and France, where its SFR unit has suffered heavy losses; and Activision Blizzard, the successful computer games maker. It is valued at well below the sum of its parts.Combined with purchases in the open market, an associate of Mr Bolloré said the Canal Plus deal would help Mr Bolloré lift his stake in Vivendi to more than 5 per cent. “His objective is to be the primary long-term industrial investor in Vivendi,” the associate said.Despite the Bolloré approval, the competition authority also slapped a series of injunctions on Canal Plus over its 2006 takeover of TPS, a rival satellite broadcaster, including an order to sell its stake in a pay television movie channel co-owned by France Telecom.The authority controversially overturned its own original approval of the takeover last September, citing a failure by Canal Plus to meet the conditions it had imposed. Canal Plus is contesting the legality of both the September order and the latest ruling."
79;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-07-13T20:46:26Z;Vivendi advances on boost from Fitch;;The agreed purchase of Aegis, the UK-listed advertising group, for £3.2bn by Dentsu gave a fillip to media companies, with Vivendi advancing 7.9 per cent to €15.77 in Paris this week. The media and telecoms company was also boosted when Fitch said a possible restructuring of the group would not necessarily be bad for bondholders.The group is under fire because its market capitalisation is far below the probable value of its assets, which include Universal and French pay-TV group Canal Plus. On Thursday, Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman, was quoted as saying the company may sell its $8.1bn stake in Activision, the video game maker.Thyssen Krupp, the German steelmaker, gained 10.6 per cent, for the biggest rise on the FTSE Eurofirst 300 this week, to €14.51, attenuating a 28.3 per cent fall over the past three months. On Tuesday, Macquarie raised its target on the group’s share price.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.9 per cent to 1042.63 this week, when early gains were erased on Thursday amid fears about the health of the world economy.Carrefour, the French retailer, defied expectations of another profit warning on Thursday when the world’s second-biggest retailer by market capitalisation said total sales fell 0.3 per cent, less than analysts had predicted. It said efforts to revive its French hypermarket business were starting to bear fruit. The shares gained 7.7 per cent to €14.54 this week.In Paris the CAC 40 edged up 0.4 per cent to 3,180.81.News that Neelie Kroes, Europe’s digital commissioner, had given the large European telecoms groups a boost by backing down on a threat to cut pricing of their networks to encourage investment in European infrastructure led to share price gains in the sector. Deutsche Telekom gained 8.0 per cent to €9.18 while Britain’s BT advanced 3.3 per cent to 222.3p.Germany’s Xetra Dax index gained 2.3 per cent to 6,557.1 this week.Peugeot tumbled 8.4 per cent to €6.48 after it announced a plant closure and 6,500 job losses in France. French ministers made clear their disapproval of the move by the company, which has received €4bn in state aid in recent years.Europe’s big mass market carmakers, outside Germany, are struggling with shrinking demand and overcapacity. Peugeot, which sells more cars than its rivals in Europe, is being hit harder and the move by the French carmaker could open the way for others to cut capacity. It resonated south to Italy where Fiat fell 2.5 per cent to €3.94 in Milan. Sergio Marchionne, Fiat’s chief executive, said last week that it would have “one plant too many” in Italy if it was unable to secure concessions from its workforce needed to build cars competitively in its home country for export to the US.In Milan the FTSE MIB fell 0.1 per cent to 13,714.68.
80;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
81;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-07-10T21:18:42Z;Fourtou faces the music with Vivendi woes;;Jean-René Fourtou has a tough job convincing European regulators that Universal Music’s purchase of EMI’s record labels will not strangle competition, but he faces an even harder task in engineering a coherent strategy for Universal’s parent Vivendi.Mr Fourtou, Vivendi’s chairman, took effective control of the French telecoms and media group last month after the abrupt departure of Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive.The two men disagreed over a restructuring plan. Vivendi is under fire because its market capitalisation is far below the probable value of its assets: ranging from Universal and Canal Plus, a French pay-TV group, to telecoms companies in France, Morocco and Brazil.According to industry sources, Vivendi is sounding out potential buyers for its 61 per cent stake in Activision Blizzard, a computer games company, as a possible way to “unlock value” for investors.However, a person close to the company says: “It’s not obvious they can sell it. Activision is big.”Time Warner and Microsoft have been linked, but the $8.2bn value of Vivendi’s stake is probably prohibitive.Other possibilities include a private equity sale, a management buyout or share sales to investment funds and in the market.Mr Lévy’s departure also makes it feasible that Mr Fourtou could try to sell SFR, a struggling French telecoms business that provides much of Vivendi’s profit. Mr Lévy was protective of the business, but Mr Fourtou is less attached.
82;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-07-03T21:45:42Z;Activision CEO’s 10 cents on Chinese Call of Duty;;The success of Activision Blizzard’s new Call of Duty game for China will hang on its localised production, according to its chief executive.Bobby Kotick was speaking from China to the FT after Tuesday’s announcement in Shanghai of a partnership with online gaming provider Tencent to bring the world’s biggest video game franchise to the market.“The entire development is being done here, so the studio is in Shanghai, it’s an original game with a new multiplayer mode and maps developed really specifically for the market here,” he said.“There’s a recognition that the games need to be developed locally and be appropriate for the audience here and that it’s very different from other markets.”Mr Kotick said Tencent had been chosen as a partner because it was the leader in the first-person shooter (FPS) category.“They have the number-one first-person action game [Crossfire] in the market, so they were very well suited for this type of game, they have a lot of expertise in this area.”Activision Blizzard currently works with the NetEase online gaming company in China for its World of Warcraft (WoW) and Starcraft games. It announced a three-year extension to that partnership in March.NetEase suffered delays winning approval from the General Administration of Press and Publication authority in China to operate WoW. Significantly, Tuesday’s announcement gave no indication of a launch date for Call of Duty Online, suggesting a similar approval process.The game has been two years in the making and will be free to play, with virtual goods such as special weapons able to be bought in micro-transactions at the in-game store.“I’m really enthusiastic about China as a market opportunity,” said Mr Kotick.“There are obvious challenges in terms of the lack of experience we have in developing unique products for this market, but I think we’re getting up to speed very quickly and Blizzard [with WoW] has learned a lot about how to do business successfully here.”Martin Lau, president of Tencent, said in a statement: “We believe Call of Duty Online will attract tens of millions of loyal fans in China.”That sounds an order of magnitude larger than Crossfire, which achieved 3.5m peak concurrent users in China in February.
83;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-06-28T18:05:46Z;Vivendi parts company with CEO;;"Jean-Bernard Lévy was ousted as chief executive of Vivendi on Thursday, opening the door to a potential break-up of the French media and telecoms group.Mr Lévy lost out to chairman Jean-René Fourtou just days after a weekend summit of directors and senior management confronted shareholder pressure to split up the group, according to people familiar with the situation.Investors and analysts have for months argued that Vivendi should be broken up to release the full value of its diverse businesses, which combine Universal Music and the gaming unit Activision Blizzard with pay-TV company Canal Plus and telecoms operations in France, Morocco and Brazil.Vivendi shares had fallen 25 per cent over the past year, but Mr Lévy had resisted calls for a radical restructuring. Yesterday, they rose 5.5 per cent to €14.20.“We know the share price performance has put pressure on [Vivendi] and we know Fourtou indicated there are no sacred cows,” said Claudio Aspesi, analyst at Bernstein Research.Group profits have been hard hit by reverses at SFR, its French telecoms unit, which is battling the entry this year of a fourth low-cost operator on the domestic market.Mr Lévy came under criticism for paying €7.8bn to buy out Vodafone’s 44 per cent stake in SFR last year, just ahead of the upheaval in the French market. SFR is expected to unveil a €1bn cost-cutting plan soon.Mr Lévy also masterminded Universal’s £1.2bn bid for EMI’s recorded music business which is undergoing regulatory scrutiny in Europe and the US. Uncertainty about the outcome has also cast a shadow over Vivendi.“They took an informal vote at the weekend [summit]; the majority consensus was that Lévy had to go. But it was Fourtou who made the final decision,” said one person familiar with the board’s thinking.At Vivendi’s weekend retreat, members of the board were understood to have decided that drastic changes needed to be taken at the top.The board’s main concerns, according to one person familiar with its thinking, were the pending US judgment on Liberty Media and the poor performance at SFR.This week a New York jury told Vivendi to pay damages of €765m to Liberty. The case dates back to a $10.3bn TV network deal the two companies struck when the French group was run by Jean-Marie Messier a decade ago.Mr Lévy will be replaced temporarily by Jean-François Dubos, the company secretary, while the search is made for a successor."
84;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-06-27T11:27:37Z;Vivendi: awaiting action;The group looks cheap but realising value will not be easy;"When one prays for good news but gets bad, it is more than a double whammy. Investors in France’s Vivendi should know. Speculation about imminent disposal/break-up plans circulated ahead of last weekend’s June board meeting, where strategy is traditionally set. Not only was there no news but, on Tuesday, a US jury returned a $950m verdict against the company over events going back to 2001. There will be an appeal. Even so, Vivendi shares, up almost 10 per cent in the board meeting run-up, surrendered most of those gains and are down a quarter over the past year.On normal valuation measures, that makes the media and telecoms group look cheap. Strip out its 61 per cent holding in US-listed Activision Blizzard, and the enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio is less than 5 times. True, its SFR mobile business is facing intense competition due to the launch of the rival Free service in France. But a first wave of market share losses may be over, and – in line with company guidance – estimates already factor in ebitda declines of almost a fifth at SFR this year.But it is one thing to look cheap; another to realise underlying value. Investors, well used to break-up numbers circulating, should be sceptical about immediate action. Activision is already quoted; Vodafone was only bought out of SFR last year when a Canal+ float (by Vivendi’s partner) was also pulled; and Universal Music is in the throes of acquiring EMI’s record labels. That leaves telecoms businesses GVT and Maroc Telecom, both with long-term potential. Dismal share price performance and a dividend cut are rightly pressurising management. Fitch is also warning on credit ratings should deleveraging not be evident in 2013. Anticipation may now underpin the shares, but action could take a little longer.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
85;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Vivendi ordered to pay €765m to Liberty;;A New York jury has told Vivendi to pay damages of €765m to Liberty Media in a case dating back to a $10.3bn TV network deal the two companies struck when the French group was run by Jean-Marie Messier a decade ago.Liberty, John Malone’s media holding company, sold most of its stake in USA Networks in 2002 for cash and about 3.5 per cent of Vivendi, which Mr Messier transformed from a utility company to a media and telecoms group.After concern over the debts built up by Mr Messier’s aggressive acquisitions sent Vivendi’s shares plunging, Liberty sued in 2003, alleging that the French group had hidden its financial troubles.Vivendi said it “strongly disagrees” with the jury verdict in the breach of contract and fraud case in the Southern District of New York and would “pursue all available paths of action to overturn the verdict or reduce the damages award”.It said it saw many grounds for appeal and continued to believe strongly that it did nothing wrong. Liberty said it would seek to make Vivendi pay interest dating back to 2002, adding that it was confident that the court would deny Vivendi’s appeal.Shares in Vivendi fell more than 3 per cent on Monday in Paris before the verdict came, after the group signalled it was in no hurry to answer shareholder demands for a radical restructuring.In a brief statement after a weekend annual meeting of top management and the board, the company said it would “communicate its plans and the necessary evolution of the group as and when appropriate”.The group’s immediate priorities appeared to be winning regulatory approval for Universal Music’s £1.2bn bid for EMI‘s recorded music business and stemming losses at SFR, its French mobile arm, which has been hard hit by the entry of a low-cost fourth operator in the local market.The weekend meeting discussed “the group’s strategic orientations”, Vivendi said, but it gave no details. SFR is expected to unveil a €1bn cost-cutting plan involving around 1,000 voluntary redundancies early next month.Universal is close to asking for second round bids for about €200m worth of classical music and music publishing assets, but is still sifting through 67 initial expressions of interest from independent labels, other music publishers and private equity firms.The owner of mobile telecoms interests in Morocco and Brazil, the Canal Plus pay-TV brand and the video games company Activision Blizzard has been under pressure to split up or sell assets as its shares have fallen 25 per cent over the past year.They rebounded from a 52-week low of €12.01 in April after Vivendi told shareholders it was willing to “review the perimeter” of its businesses. But the shares slipped 3.39 per cent to €13.53 on Monday in a Paris market that fell 2.24 per cent.
86;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-06-21T17:07:36Z;Pressure on Vivendi to show its hand;;Intense speculation about the future strategy of Vivendi, the French media and telecoms group, has turned a normally discreet annual corporate get-together on the Mediterranean island of Corsica this weekend into a highly anticipated summit meeting.The company itself stoked the speculation when it told shareholders in April that discussions about whether it should split up its businesses or sell off some assets were “not taboo”.It pointed out that strategy would be discussed at the Corsica meeting, which brings together the board and the heads of Universal Music, SFR, the troubled French mobile phone division, the pay-TV group Canal Plus, Activision Blizzard, the fast-growing computer games maker and other units.Now Vivendi is trying to play down expectations about what might emerge. “This annual retreat has become like the G8 of Vivendi, but there will not be white smoke on Monday,” predicted one insider.But even if this weekend proves not to be decisive, the company is under pressure about the direction of the group, currently seen as being worth much less than the sum of its parts.“There is a lot of pressure on the board because the shares have been so low,” said a person in one of the main business units.Claudio Aspesi, an analyst with Bernstein Research who has long argued in favour of splitting the company, estimated last month that a full break-up could more than double the value of Vivendi’s shares, which are down 25 per cent on a year ago.Vivendi has vehemently denied Bloomberg reports that it is actively considering a break-up. But a debate is clearly under way about possible strategic changes, although the company denies any significant differences between chairman Jean-René Fourtou and Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chief executive.“There are multiple theories,” says Mr Aspesi, who sees a debate between those who favour a restructuring and those who would rather play for time.Recent leaks and denials “all suggest potential discrepancies in the views of the future”.Vivendi could split the company into telecoms and entertainment, or sell individual pieces, he said, but the merits of any divestiture would depend first on market demand for the assets and second on whether the company returned the proceeds to investors.One close observer says: “The challenge they’re struggling with is that there is truly not anything that’s easily executable given market conditions. My guess is that they’ll focus on fixing SFR and buy themselves more time.”Vivendi’s most pressing immediate concern is SFR. Hammered earlier this year by the launch of the ultra-low cost network Free, the fourth mobile operator in France, the troubles at SFR were largely behind a 13 per cent fall in Vivendi’s first-quarter profits.Vivendi slashed its 2011 dividend to €1 from €1.40 and says net income will not return to growth until 2014.The reversal followed the €7.8bn buyout just last year of Vodafone’s 44 per cent stake in SFR, reinforcing the perception that Vivendi had overpaid, and giving fuel to those who argue that the group should be split up.Mr Lévy took over temporarily at SFR and a turnround plan is due next month, with a new chief executive set to step into the unit in August.There are other reasons why Vivendi may wait at least until later in the year to show its hand.It is still wrangling with regulators in Europe and the US over Universal’s £1.2bn bid for EMI’s recorded music division. Vivendi seems confident of approval, but will probably have to make concessions, meaning the final shape of the deal is still not clear.Importantly, it is also awaiting approval of deals by Canal Plus that will pave the way for Vincent Bolloré, the French investor, to take a 5 per cent stake in Vivendi.Mr Bolloré, who has said he will be a long-term investor, is set to join the board in the autumn as a key member – but will not be at the meeting in Corsica.“He is waiting to participate in the [strategy] debate,” says an associate.In the meantime, the most frequently cited asset for a potential sale is Activision, maker of the Call of Dutygame.But at a valuation of almost $9bn, Vivendi’s 61 per cent stake in Activision may simply be too big to sell, and analysts struggle to think of any obvious buyers.Patrick Kirby of Deutsche Bank wrote earlier this month that any disposal of Activision would be “a complete about-face of the group’s previous strategic direction”.He added: “Games is a strong cash flow generator, but because Vivendi does not have full ownership, it only receives a dividend. If anything, therefore, we believe the group might do well to reconsider buying Activision outright as part of its annual review.”
87;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Console makers adapt to gamers’ new habits;;At the annual E3 video game show this week, console makers’ main focus will not be on the latest games, but rather other forms of entertainment like music and movies that they hope will extend the life and functionality of their now-ageing boxes.Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Sony’s PlayStation 3 are now nearly seven years old, and both companies are looking to offer music, movies and even live television through them, in addition to games, to reignite consumers’ interest.Microsoft is also matching Nintendo’s Wii U, the successor to the Wii due later this year, with a new feature that allows movies, photos and other media to be transferred on to a TV, via the Xbox, from a tablet or laptop running Windows 8.The move comes as consoles and the video game publishers that supply them with disk-based games – a traditional area of strength for consoles – risk being left behind by new platforms and changes in gamers habits. Consoles’ technical capabilities are also being overtaken by improvements in graphics in other devices, like tablets and PCs.Game disk sales are down 31 per cent this year so far in the US – a fourth consecutive year of falls despite the number of consoles in households continuing to grow.Michael Pachter, video game analyst at Wedbush Securities, says publishers have released fewer titles and relied too much on sequels as they anticipate the end of the current console cycle.“They have been reluctant to greenlight any new [intellectual property] – in 2007, Electronic Arts made 49 games, in 2012, they are making 19,” he says.“As far as casual gaming on consoles goes, clearly social gaming has taken away the Wii effect. The 85 year-old grandma or the 45-year-old housewife, who were playing Wii tennis or Wii Fit, are now playing FarmVille, [a popular Facebook game].”The PC is also coming into its own again as a platform for social casual gaming, online multiplayer games and downloading digital content.“The gaming audience is moving to the PC somewhat out of desire and somewhat out of necessity, which is what tends to happen when the console cycle is winding down,” says John Davison, head of programming at the Gamespot gamers’ website.He says young gamers are using hand-me-down laptops to play sophisticated online games. The Steam download service for PC games has become very popular, as are new titles such as Activision Blizzard’s Diablo III, which sold 3.5m copies in its first 24 hours last month – a record for a PC game.Console gamers are also purchasing fewer disk-based games as they prefer extensions to blockbuster games that are available to buy and download.“They are sticking with fewer games for longer, buying downloadable content or subscriptions for them, so the big games are becoming platforms in themselves, keeping their audiences engaged by constantly feeding them new content,” says Mr Davison.Digital sales are not included in the monthly software figures for the industry, meaning the picture is brighter than it looks for publishers such as Activision, which sells map pack extensions for its Call of Duty game and subscriptions for World of Warcraft, and Electronic Arts, which has been exporting its major franchises to Facebook and mobile gaming apps.Mobile phones, tablets and smart TVs now have multi-core processors that can almost match the capabilities of consoles. In another shift, the chipmaker Nvidia last month unveiled graphics processors (GPU) for data centres that would deliver rich “cloud” gaming to even the simplest of devices.“I think the announcement from Nvidia of more formalised cloud GPU support is going to lead to more cloud gaming products coming out, it’s a logical progression,” says Brian Blau, video game analyst at the Gartner research firm.Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities says Microsoft is positioning itself to offer the next Xbox as an all-round entertainment appliance, sold at a subsidised price with a monthly subscription – similar to how cable or satellite TV boxes are now being offered. He points to a new experiment where the Xbox 360 is being offered for $99 with a $15 a month Xbox Live subscription for two years.“The next console could be a $100 box where you sign up for five years,” he says.E3 attendees may listen in vain for news of Microsoft and Sony’s next console offerings, expected in 2013, although Nintendo is expected to set a fourth-quarter 2012 launch date for the Wii U. One thing is certain: the forthcoming, eighth console generation will compete for gamers’ time with many more alternatives than its predecessors.
88;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-05-21T18:48:36Z;Games tax relief lures back Activision;;Activision Blizzard, the US-based games company behind titles such as Call of Duty and Guitar Hero, is planning to set up a new studio in the UK, the first large publisher to increase investment after new tax relief rules announced by the government.Activision is understood to be recruiting staff for a studio located in the north of England which will focus on making mobile games. Martyn Brown, a UK industry veteran, has been appointed to hire developers for the venture.“We are investing in mobile initiatives and that includes a UK studio,” Activision said. It did not reveal the size of the investment.Tiga, the games industry body, said the Activision move indicated that the government’s decision to offer games makers film-style tax relief on production costs was helping to bring companies back to the UK.“This is a massive vote of confidence in the UK games industry and demonstrates that Tiga’s successful campaign for games tax relief is already bearing fruit,” said Richard Wilson, the organisation’s chief executive.Activision dramatically scaled back its presence in the UK in 2011 when it closed down its Bizarre Creations studio in Liverpool, affecting 200 jobs. That closure came just six months after the incoming coalition government had blocked a Labour plan for tax relief.Since 2006, the UK has gone from being the world’s third-largest games maker to sixth place in 2011, losing out to countries such as Canada that attract developers with tax breaks. The UK now accounts for just 3.5 per cent of global investment in the sector, down from 10 per cent in 2000.Other games publishers have so far been more hesitant about reinvesting in the UK. Electronic Arts, which also closed a UK studio last year, has said that the tax relief appears less favourable for games companies than similar relief for film, television and animation.
89;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Vivendi plans ‘drastic’ cost cuts at SFR;;Vivendi has confirmed that it is willing to review “the perimeter” of its media and telecoms businesses and said it was planning “drastic” cost cuts at its domestic mobile phone division, SFR.Shares in the French company have fallen sharply this year because of a fierce price war in its home mobile phone market, leading to renewed questions about whether the group’s market value adequately reflects the sum of its parts.Unveiling a 13 per cent fall in adjusted net income to €823m for the first three months of the year, Philippe Capron, Vivendi’s chief financial officer, said: “The board is periodically reviewing the strategy and that includes potentially the perimeter …we always have in mind the value for shareholders.”The comments from Mr Capron come after the company’s directors wrote to shareholders last month telling them that discussions were not “taboo” about whether the company – which also owns Universal Music, Activision Blizzard, the computer games maker, and pay-TV group Canal Plus – should consider splitting its telecoms and media businesses or spin off some assets.The company’s future strategy is due to be discussed at a meeting of executives on the French island of Corsica next month. Speculation about a potential change increased after Vincent Bolloré, the French investor, recently emerged as a Vivendi shareholder.Mr Capron said on Monday night: “Mr Bolloré has not made any specific declarations to the board, though he has made some public statements supporting the management.“There have been no criticisms, but if he had some to make then I’m sure he would do it publicly.”The finance director also said he believed that an ultra-low cost rival in its French mobile phone business, Free Mobile, had “lost steam on the market” though its early impact on French mobile phone prices was still considerable.Free, which is owned by Iliad, a company controlled by French billionaire Xavier Niel, has lured customers away from Vivendi and other large telecoms groups by slashing prices.Vivendi said it had lost 274,000 French mobile customers in the first three months of the year. It said on Monday that there would be “drastic and structural changes” at SFR and “significant cost-cutting programmes”.The company repeated its guidance that SFR’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would fall by between 12 and 15 per cent this year.Mr Capron also said that the antitrust process to clear Universal’s purchase of EMI’s recorded music business was on track. “On both sides of the Atlantic you hear a lot of noise, but most of this comes from competitors and not from customers or partners in the music industry. We are confident the decisions will enable us to go ahead.”
90;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-05-09T23:47:39Z;Activision Blizzard subscribers fall;;Activision Blizzard’s first quarter sales fell 22 per cent and profits more than halved year-on-year as subscribers to its World of Warcraft online game declined and it spent more on new games.The world’s largest video game publisher by market capitalisation reported World of Warcraft subscriber numbers, after losses last summer, had steadied quarter-on-quarter to stay at 10.2m. Electronic Arts reported on Monday that the rival game it launched in December – Star Wars: The Old Republic – had seen subscribers fall from 1.7m to 1.3m.Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, told an analyst conference call that the company continued to build “a portfolio of mega-franchises”, with at least four making significant contributions to profitability in 2012.Beyond 2012, new games from Blizzard, Bungie – the developer of the Halo franchise – and an expansion of Activision’s Call of Duty franchise to China gave it “the strongest pipeline of new potential mega-franchises in our history”, he said.Mr Kotick said Black Ops II, the latest update to the company’s biggest franchise, Call of Duty, had the potential to be the biggest entertainment event of the year with its launch in November. Preorders were tracking ahead of the record-breaking current game, Modern Warfare III.Activision reported first-quarter sales of $587m, down from $755m a year earlier, but ahead of analyst expectations of $552m. Earnings of 6 cents a share compared to 13 cents a year ago and the 4 cents expected by Wall Street.
91;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-04-27T17:56:50Z;Vivendi moves to reassure bondholders;;"Vivendi has sought to reassure nervous bondholders that it will avoid putting its credit rating in jeopardy following talk of a strategic overhaul at the French media and telecoms group.Frustrated by its underperforming share price, the owner of Universal Music and France’s SFR mobile phone network last month told investors it was not irrevocably wedded to its conglomerate structure.In a letter to shareholders, Vivendi’s chairman Jean-René Fourtou and chief executive Jean-Bernard Lévy said that the question of whether it should sell businesses or even split into two or three units was “not taboo”.Bloomberg went a step further on Wednesday evening by reporting that the group was actively considering a break-up into separate media and telecoms businesses, or a spin-off of Canal Plus, its pay-TV arm.Vivendi denied the story, saying it was “astonished” by the claims. Nonetheless its shares – which were at their lowest point since 2003 earlier this month – rose 4 per cent to €13.87 on Thursday.But while the mutterings about a break-up were a tonic to the share price, they had the opposite effect on its €11.9bn of publicly traded bonds.Yields – which move inversely to prices – climbed to their highest since February in most cases. The yield of one benchmark €1bn bond maturing in 2015 rose 31 basis points on Thursday, and edged up again on Friday to 2.59 per cent.Covenant Review, a fixed income research house, said investors in a $2bn bond issue earlier this month were worried that their position might be undermined by any restructuring.“Regardless of this denial, a situation like this could attract more activist investors to push for strategic change, and Vivendi is not broadly rejecting any future break-up,” it said.The nervousness prompted Vivendi to issue a second statement on Thursday to address fears that the holding company might be hollowed out, saying it remained committed to preserving its long-term debt ratings.Universal Music is the world’s biggest recorded music group, featuring artists such as Lady Gaga and Rihanna. Vivendi also owns a majority stake in Activision Blizzard, maker of video games such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.Its SFR business, meanwhile, has been hurt by the expansion of Iliad, the innovative internet service provider, into cheap mobile telephony with its Free Mobile brand.Mr Lévy has consistently argued that there are compelling benefits to having the media and telecoms businesses together.Last November, he told the Financial Times that Vivendi had no intention of spinning off Universal after sealing the £1.2bn purchase of EMI’s recorded music division.US and European regulators are giving the deal close scrutiny, and may not give their verdict until September. Music industry members believe a spin-off of Universal is unlikely until it becomes clear how much of EMI it is allowed to buy.Equity analysts at Macquarie Capital said the sale of some of Vivendi’s media assets – such as its Activision Blizzard stake – would offer the quickest fix for its shares. Barclays Capital also highlighted Activision Blizzard as a sale candidate.Vivendi directors and executives are due to discuss strategic matters at an annual three-day meeting in June. One potential catalyst for change is the emergence of Vincent Bolloré, the buccaneering French investor, as a Vivendi shareholder.Analysts at Natixis – who estimate that Vivendi trades at a discount of about a third to the aggregate value of its businesses – cited rumours suggesting he might increase his stake from about 1 per cent to as much as 10 per cent.At Vivendi’s annual shareholder meeting last week, Mr Fourtou said Mr Bolloré would be welcome to join its board.However, Natixis said any attempt to combine Vivendi with Havas – the marketing services group where Mr Bolloré is the biggest shareholder – would have little credibility. Mr Bolloré’s spokesman could not be reached for comment.Vivendi has been the subject of a break-up attempt before. In 2006, it rejected a sketchy approach from a little-known Norwegian businessman called Alexander Vik.Mr Vik had criticised Vivendi for keeping both telecoms and media assets, claiming that this was a “Jean-Marie Messier strategy” – a reference to the disgraced former leader of the French group.However, Mr Vik’s attempt to pressurise the company into a break-up failed. Later in 2006 it emerged that Vivendi had received a buyout approach from KKR that would have kept the group intact; however, that possibility also came to nothing.Vivendi’s future is once again a subject of debate. But whether it leads to material changes in its structure could hinge on the outcome of its strategy summit in June.Additional reporting by Daniel Thomas and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson"
92;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-04-12T15:57:13Z;Vivendi caught unaware by telecoms rival;;"As owners of a music company whose roster of pop acts includes acts as diverse as Mariah Carey, Marilyn Manson, Elton John and Lady Gaga, Vivendi’s directors are used to doing business in a sometimes irrational world.But its failure to cope with the unpredictable behaviour of rivals in the telecoms business has left the French group and its chief executive Jean-Bernard Lévy looking vulnerable at home.Outside France, Vivendi is best known as a media business, owner of Universal Music and Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest music and computer game companies by sales.But it makes most of its revenues and profits from the unglamorous business of telecoms, largely in France. And it is there that it is struggling. Vivendi’s domestic telecoms company, SFR, is under attack from an upstart rival, Free Mobile, which has cut prices to a level the industry would have thought impossible a few months ago.For Mr Lévy, the situation has become so alarming that he has ousted SFR’s longstanding chief executive, Frank Esser, and taken direct control of the company. As a colleague says: “Jean-Bernard is going to personally take the fight to Free.”The stakes are high because it was only last year that he sanctioned the €7.8bn purchase of a 44 per cent holding in SFR from Vodafone, its former joint venture partner.Mr Lévy says Vivendi profits would have fallen in 2011 without the SFR purchase. But some analysts and investors have criticised the deal – valued at 6.2 times SFR’s 2010 operating earnings – because the arrival of Free Mobile, owned by French billionaire Xavier Niel’s company Iliad, was known about at the time.Claudio Aspesi, a Bernstein analyst, says such criticism is unjustified given that many Vivendi shareholders applauded the deal when it was announced. “The markets have misjudged just as much as anyone else the impact of Iliad,” he says.While the new low-cost rival was no surprise to Mr Lévy, the aggression of Free’s pricing caught the French telecoms industry on the hop. Free is offering limited mobile phone services to customers of its fixed-line business at no charge.French regulators estimate that Free has won at least 2m customers from rivals, including France Telecom and Bouygues. Its launch led to a profit warning and slashed dividend at Vivendi.Mr Lévy is furious about a deal whereby Free is paying to use France Telecom’s network, which he believes has let the upstart offer prices that should be unsustainable.That deal has provided France Telecom, the leading French telephone company on all measures, with a hedge against Free’s impact which some analysts estimate could be worth €2bn over six years. France Telecom shares have fallen about 10 per cent since Free’s January launch, compared with 20 per cent at Vivendi.France Telecom insiders say Mr Lévy’s criticisms are sour grapes and he spoke to Mr Niel about a possible deal. Vivendi says it did talk to Free, but only offered the use of its inferior second-generation network.For Mr Aspesi, Vivendi’s surprised reaction to the impact of France Telecom’s deal with Free shows how easily it can be outwitted by rivals acting unpredictably. “Vivendi is very good at being extremely rational,” he says. “But they struggle whenever anyone behaves in an apparently irrational way.”Mr Lévy, a telecoms engineer by background, has to work out how to cut costs at SFR while devising a marketing strategy to convince customers that his network’s quality makes it worth a higher fee.He must also steer another deal that will define his term; Universal’s $1.9bn purchase of EMI’s recorded music business, through a lengthy European antitrust probe. Mr Lévy will be hoping for no more unwelcome surprises this year."
93;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-03-26T17:44:40Z;Vivendi chief assumes control of SFR;;The longstanding chief executive of Vivendi’s SFR is leaving France’s second-biggest telephone company by sales and customers, becoming the biggest victim yet of a domestic price war that has alarmed the country’s largest operators.Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi’s chief executive, will take direct immediate control of SFR from Frank Esser, who steps down after a decade at the helm. Mr Lévy has a considerable personal stake in the success of the SFR business after spending €7.7bn just last year on buying a 44 per cent shareholding in the operator from Vodafone, Vivendi’s former joint venture partner.Vivendi is best known outside France for its ownership of media companies such as Universal Music Group and Activision Blizzard, the world’s leading computer games company by sales. But it makes most of its profit from telecoms operations in France, Morocco and Brazil. France’s SFR contributed 40 per cent of earnings before interest, tax and amortisation last year.However, SFR is struggling because of the launch in January of a highly aggressive competitor, Free Mobile, which offers some mobile services to its fixed-line customers at no charge.Mr Lévy slashed Vivendi’s dividend in March after warning that SFR’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation could fall by between 12 per cent and 15 per cent largely as a result of Free’s launch.Vivendi appears so far to have suffered worse than the other large incumbents from the launch of Free, which is owned by Xavier Niel, France’s most successful entrepreneur of recent years. France Télécom, the country’s biggest telephone group on all measures, has signed an agreement with Iliad, Free’s parent company, to provide most of its network coverage, which it hopes will bring in more than €1bn in revenues over next six years.The agreement has infuriated Mr Lévy, who claims it enabled Mr Niel to launch his ultra low-cost service. Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said it was Vivendi’s inability to predict apparently “irrational behaviour” by its competitors that had led to the problems at SFR.Since the launch of Free on January 10, Vivendi’s shares have fallen 14 per cent, while France Télécom’s have dropped less than 4 per cent.Mr Lévy’s purchase of the 44 per cent SFR Vodafone stake has been criticised in the light of the impact of Free. However, he told the Financial Times this month that the purchase added €480m to net profit in 2011, which would have declined without the deal.Part of his job at SFR will involve cutting costs, establishing a competitive pricing range, and convincing customers of the strength of SFR’s network in comparison with rivals.
94;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-03-23T17:57:17Z;Angry Birds maker heads into space;;"This week’s launch of Angry Birds Space has propelled the mobile game’s Finnish developer, Rovio, into the stratosphere, instantly topping app store download charts around the world.But whereas the original Angry Birds was a viral hit, notching up hundreds of millions of downloads with minimal marketing, this latest update landed in a marketing blitz more akin to a Disney blockbuster than a 99 cents mobile phone app.Walmart is promoting Angry Birds toys heavily in 3,000 of its stores, National Geographic is publishing an “educational” book about the mysteries of the universe and Rovio even worked with Nasa, the US space agency, to film a promotional video on the International Space Station.Angry Birds is leading a gaggle of digital games franchises that want to take on Mickey Mouse and Peppa Pig as the world’s leading brands for kids – and big kids.“We look at the launch of Angry Birds Space as the release of a major new entertainment franchise,” says Andrew Stalbow, general manager for Rovio in North America, where many such licensing deals are struck.“Given our reach of over 700m downloads, and engagement levels of approximately 300 million minutes of gameplay every day, we have an opportunity to bring our franchise to market in a unique way.”Following in the Angry Birds slipstream are Mind Candy’s Moshi Monsters, Zynga’s Farmville, Zeptolab’s Cut The Rope, Mojang’s Minecraft and Activision’s Skylanders, many of whom were out in force at last month’s International Toy Fair in New York.Elaine Hooper, toy buyer at UK retailer John Lewis, said: “What most stood out at this year’s Toy Fair was the amount of app- and smartphone-related toys.“The server-to-shelf phenomenon is continuing to grow …Children are early adopters of new technology and the toy industry is embracing that.”Angry Birds sold 25m plush toys last year and had a top-selling board game with Mattel, with branded playground equipment arriving soon in the UK from Lappset. Niklas Zennström, the former Skype founder who now heads up Rovio backer Atomico Ventures, says these products delight fans and provide revenues but crucially also create a “feedback loop” back to the app itself.“Someone who has stopped playing the game might see someone wearing an Angry Birds T shirt or walk past a shop window filled with the toys – that is a cue to go back and play the game again,” he says. “That to me is significant because it takes the company from being a developer of mobile games to an entertainment franchise.”Moshi Monsters, which has notched up 60m players of its virtual-pets-meets-social-network game, has 130 spin-off products, including a Moshi Music album coming out next month. Moshi has sold 20m collectible figures with Vivid Imaginations and 10m packs of Topps trading cards, with a total of more than $100m-worth of physical toys sold at retail last year.That’s a long way short of Hello Kitty, which sells several billion dollars’ worth of products every year, but it is a good start for an industry which barely existed two years ago.Misha Lyalin, chief executive of Moscow-based ZeptoLab, said: “There hasn’t been a big explosion of new [toy] content for many years.”Zeptolab recently hired a new head of licensing and merchandising from Nickelodeon, home of SpongeBob Squarepants. Mr Lyalin added: “Those old brands are going to go away and the new brands are going to take their place.”With more than 100m downloads of Cut the Rope games, ZeptoLab is now working with Mattel on “Apptivity” digitally enhanced toys and a board game, and with Li & Fung, the Chinese company, on branded clothing.Michael Acton Smith, chief executive of Mind Candy, the London-based creator of Moshi Monsters, contrasts this week’s $200m writedown by Disney of its underperforming John Carter movie with Zynga’s $200m acquisition of OMGPOP, developers of hit Facebook and mobile game Draw Something.“Historically, films or TV shows were at the heart of the biggest global entertainment franchises – no longer,” Mr Smith says. “A film, TV show, or a console game takes years to build and can cost tens of millions. Those are very big, high-risk bets. Making bets on online entertainment is much cheaper and faster. When you’re crafting online entertainment you can tweak, iterate and mould the experience like clay until it resonates with your fans. Ultimately you can create entertainment that your audience actually wants, not what you think they want.”Mr Smith believes that the “billion-dollar brands of tomorrow will have digital hearts”. However, Matthew Conrad, a brand licensing consultant at marketing group M&C Saatchi, sees co-existence rather than displacement.“I don’t think it signals any changing of the guard, simply the toy manufacturers responding to the market and aligning themselves with properties that are popular with kids,” he says. “Are they ditching their Star Wars or Disney licences to make way for Angry Birds and Moshi Monsters? I doubt it.”Mr Conrad adds: “What is interesting, though, is that both these properties have started in the digital world but that they see the need to exist in the non-digital world too.”Mr Smith says there are “many kids who love the Moshi Monsters brand that aren’t even aware the website exists. They love the colour, humour, characters and storylines.”While digital games consume millions of hours of kids’ collective time, critics say that some apps lack the depth of characterisation and narrative which give traditional children’s characters their longevity. Moshi Monsters is working to embellish its storytelling with a magazine, now the UK’s top-selling children’s publication with 162,000 monthly sales, and a forthcoming cartoon on YouTube.Another risk is damaging the franchise by licensing too many spin-offs. “We probably turn down three or four times as many deals as we accept,” says Mr Smith. “This is a marathon not a sprint so we have to be careful.”Mojang’s recent deal to create Lego kits is a strong fit for its Minecraft virtual world, as both involve building with blocks, whether physical or digital. “We try to pick things that we would actually wear or use ourselves, that’s our filtering,” says Carl Manneh, Mojang chief executive. “We have all played with Lego as kids and to be part of actually producing a new Lego product is a dream come true …Recently we were asked to make a Minecraft fragrance; that was a no.”"
95;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Vivendi chief attacks France Telecom;;Vivendi‘s chief executive attacked France Telecom for facilitating the recent launch of Free Mobile, a low-cost French wireless operator, after the media and telecoms group slashed its dividend and warned of falling profits.Shares of the company, which also blamed French tax increases for the gloomy forecast, dropped 10 per cent to €15.50.In comments that reveal the industry tensions caused by Free’s arrival, Vivendi’s chief executive, Jean-Bernard Lévy, accused his France Telecom counterpart, Stéphane Richard, of offering “excessively favourable conditions” to Free, which is using France Telecom’s network for most of its calls. He also blamed France’s telecoms regulator, Arcep, and the government, and threatened possible legal action, without expanding further.Vivendi, which owns the French operator, SFR, believes the decision to allow Free to piggyback on France Telecom’s network has let the start-up offer prices that would have been impossible otherwise. Free – owned by Xavier Niel, a telecoms billionaire– is offering some mobile services at no charge to existing fixed-line customers.France Telecom said: “The terms of our roaming contract with Free are confidential but were agreed on a normal commercial basis.”Mr Lévy defended his decision last year to spend €8bn buying out its former partner in SFR, Vodafone, despite the imminent French price war. “Without the purchase we would have had declining profits in 2011, rather than an increase,” he said.Answering criticism from analysts that the dividend cut had broken promises, he said the changing business environment had forced his hand.France Telecom has also cut its dividend, but has hedged its bets by charging Free to use its network, estimating it will generate more than €1bn in sales over six years.All of the big operators, including France Telecom, have accused Free of not complying with the terms of its mobile licence, which states that it must have at least 27 per cent network coverage in France. Mr Lévy said he “could not understand” comments from Arcep this week saying Free was compliant. Free has declined to comment about the availability of its network.Because of the effect of the French price war and higher taxes, Mr Lévy predicted Vivendi’s adjusted net income would be “more than €2.5bn” in 2012 compared with €2.95bn last year, and would probably only start increasing again in 2014.Sales were flat at €28.8bn in 2011. Vivendi is cutting the 2011 dividend to €1 a share from €1.40 a year before, though shareholders will receive one bonus share for every 30 owned.
96;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Activision Blizzard: lurking dangers;Game company has long been the analysts’ darling but its shares barely reflect that affection;The video game industry has reached adulthood at last. The average player is 37 years old and 42 per cent of players are female, according to the Entertainment Software Association (although some things have not changed: an informal poll of cool people finds that 77 per cent of gamers are still geeks).One sign of the industry’s maturity is the financial performance of Activision Blizzard, which seems to be designed with shareholders, not nerds, in mind. The company has a huge base of customers – 50m just for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, its two most popular games, and squeezes free cash out of them with utility-like consistency: $880m in 2011, for a free-cash yield of more than 6 per cent. It returns virtually all of the dough to shareholders as buy-backs or dividends. Earnings per share increased at a double-digit pace last year despite sluggish revenue. In other words, if the top line recharges, earning will pop. It therefore makes perfect sense that the company’s stock should be up almost threefold over the past decade and that most Wall Street analysts have “buy” ratings on the stock.Given all this, why do Activision’s shares trade at hardly any premium to the market? There are two worries. Steady profits require hot new games or reviving old ones – a chancy business, as the collapse of Activision’s own Guitar Hero franchise last year shows. And the growth of pure online gaming threatens games bought at retailers and played on internet-connected consoles or PCs, which account for two-thirds of Activision’s sales. The first worry is probably never going to go away, despite the remarkable resilience of Duty and Warcraft. As with film studios, a game company is judged largely by its last hit. But the second worry, online gaming, is likely to fade over time provided that Activision, however it delivers its products, keeps the money rolling in.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
97;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Call of Duty takes big January hit;;For anyone seeking holes in Activision’s seemingly bulletproof Call of Duty franchise, there was a chink in the armour exposed in NPD US January sales figures released late on Thursday.Sales fell nearly 50 per cent year-on-year for the world’s best-selling video game in 2011 – that’s comparing the performance of the latest in the franchise – Modern Warfare 3 – with its predecessor, Black Ops.The numbers are surprising because MW3 eclipsed Black Ops sales on its initial release.Activision reported $775m in global sales of the game in its first five days of availability in November – exceeding the record of $650m set a year before by Black Ops and $550m two years ago for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.But while console sales for MW2 were 658,000 units in January 2010 and Black Ops sold 750,000 units a year ago, MW3 sold only 386,000 units in the US last month.“As a result, MW3 sales to date are now essentially flat versus Black Ops last year,” said Cowen and Company analysts in a note.“We now expect MW3 to sell through slightly fewer units than Black Ops across its lifetime.”Any sign of a decline of player interest is likely to be seized on by competitors such as EA, whose Battlefield franchise is trying to challenge Call of Duty.But Activision can point to growing digital success not reflected in the NPD disk-based software numbers – it revealed on its earnings call on Thursday that 1.7m paying subscribers had been rapidly recruited to its new Call of Duty Elite online service.It has also shown an ability to replace waning major franchises with new IP – Guitar Hero is no more, but the toy-based game Skylanders is looking like another success, while it said yesterday it expected great things from a new property developed by Halo creator Bungie. World of Warcraft subscriptions declined in a dry year for releases for its Blizzard division in 2011, but it plans several launches in 2012.While noting a good pipeline of games, analysts at Macquarie Securities downgraded Activision’s shares to a neutral rating on Friday. “While we still like its long-term potential, investors in the video-game sector look for near-term catalysts and we see few,” they said in a note.“Dark clouds and negative perceptions are hanging over the group right now,” they added, commenting on video game stocks in general.Such perceptions are being driven by the continuing underperformance of the traditional disk-based business. NPD reported home and handheld console software dollar sales were down 38 per cent year-on-year in January to $356m, compared to expectations of a 22 per cent fall by Cowen and only a 12 per cent fall to $505m predicted by Wedbush analysts, from $576m in January 2011.NPD blamed a lack of software launches and poor hardware and accessory performance. With only the launch of the PlayStation Vita handheld console this month, and the Wii U, expected later this year, there seems little else to interest investors in the short term other than progress in digital sales.
98;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2012-02-09T23:47:57Z;‘Call of Duty’ franchise boosts Activision;;Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, reported fourth-quarter sales and profits ahead of Wall Street expectations, powered by the continuing success of its Call of Duty franchise and a new children’s game that sold more than 20m associated toys.The company also revealed it was stemming subscriber losses to its World of Warcraft online role-playing game and said it would begin targeting Facebook as a major gaming platform.The Santa Monica-based company reported fourth-quarter revenues of $2.4bn and earnings per share of 62 cents, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $2.2bn in sales and 56 cents.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was the industry’s best-selling game in 2011. Released in November, it achieved $1bn in sales in its first 16 days.The company also benefited from the success of Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure, the best-selling title last year for six- to 11-year-olds. More than 20m “smart” action figures, which interact with the game when they are placed on a “Portal of Power” pedestal, were sold during the fourth quarter.A sequential loss of 800,000 subscribers to 10.3m for World of Warcraft which concerned analysts in the third quarter, fell to a 100,000 loss in the fourth.The company has ignored Facebook and social gaming to date, but Bobby Kotick, chief executive, suggested in an interview with the Financial Times that this was about to change.“Facebook continues to make great investments in making itself more robust and interesting for us as a gaming platform, “ he said. “We definitely view Facebook as a very significant new opportunity.”Activision would compete with its main rival Electronic Arts and newcomer Zynga on Facebook. EA is also mounting a challenge to World of Warcraft with its Star Wars: The Old Republic online game.But with downloadable content, such as map packs for its Call of Duty games, Activision is ahead in digital revenues. It said they reached $1.6bn and accounted for 34 per cent of total sales in 2011. Its recently launched Call of Duty Elite online service had grown to 1.7m paying subscribers by the end of January.For 2012, there will be a new Call of Duty game and a follow-up Skylanders game called Giants for the holiday season. Blizzard, the creator of World of Warcraft, plans a number of releases after no new titles in 2011.Activision forecast revenues of $4.5bn for the year, virtually flat compared with 2011 and slightly below analyst forecasts of $4.567bn, as it predicted a negative $200m foreign exchange impact.Its shares rose just over 1 per cent to $12.80 in extended trading in New York.
99;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-12-18T18:31:56Z;Electronic Arts seeks online gaming share;Star Wars launch to compete with World of Warcraft;A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away, Electronic Arts was the number one video game publisher and Activision its closest rival.Then Activision joined forces with Vivendi’s games unit in 2008 to become the industry leader, adding its Blizzard division and World of Warcraft, the biggest online role-playing game.But now the empire is striking back. EA launches Star Wars: The Old Republic on Tuesday, with hopes of winning the loyalty of online gamers to the George Lucas sci-fi franchise and eventually overtaking World of Warcraft.The stakes are high because the video games industry is now one of the biggest parts of the entertainment sector, having overtaken the film industry several years ago. In the US alone last year, $25.1bn was spent on games compared with $10.5bn taken at the box office.Silicon Valley-based EA has had some success in taking on Activision Blizzard in the “first-person shooter” genre, in which players see the virtual world through the eyes of their character, who is typically armed with a gun. Its Battlefield 3 sold more than 5m copies in its first week, although its rival’s all-conquering Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3sold 6.5m copies in its first 24 hours when going on sale in November.Star Wars has had an encouraging testing phase, with 1.6m gamers volunteering to play an early “beta” version and nearly 1m pre-orders for the game, a copy of which will cost $60 plus a monthly subscription.World of Warcraft has more than 10m subscribers worldwide, but Ray Muzyka, co-founder of BioWare, the EA studio that makes the new Star Wars game, says it has the potential to be even bigger, given the power of the brand.“We know from market research that a lot of MMO [massively multiplayer online] players are actively looking for the next big thing and they actually consider Star Wars to be that, either from personal experience of going through the beta or knowing someone who is in it,” he says.World of Warcraft does appear vulnerable at present. Activision shares fell in November when it reported continuing and more rapid declines in subscriptions – down to 10.3m in the third quarter from more than 12m at the start of the year.The company said most of the decline could be attributed to Asia, where China represents more than half of the global player base.“We think there’s a very vibrant community. There’s new content coming next year and we’re not spending a lot of time thinking what our competitors are doing,” says Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive.Michael Pachter, video games analyst at Wedbush Securities, sees Star Wars winning a 10 to 15 per cent share of the $10bn MMO market.“It will take some of that from World of Warcraft, but I have confidence Activision can get its numbers back up through growth in places like Brazil and China,” he says.Star Wars: The Old Republic is set 3,000 years before the rise of Darth Vader and features 1,000 actors’ voices. Players buy the game and then pay a subscription of around $15 a month to continue exploring its universe, with LucasArts receiving royalties from EA.
100;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Family gatherings round the console;There are some innovative titles out there;"Video game software sales this holiday season have been driven by hardcore gamers buying the latest sequels such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 or Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but there are some family-focused titles out there and new ways of viewing them.RocksmithActivision may have abandoned its ailing Guitar Hero franchise this year, but video game players have been spared a return to the air-guitar era by Ubisoft’s launch of Rocksmith, a far more authentic experience than imaginary axe-wielding or playing with a guitar-shaped controller.Rocksmith must be played with a real guitar, the drawback being that players have to provide the instrument themselves. That said, one trend that emerged from Guitar Hero, essentially a rhythm game of pressing buttons in time and in sequence, is that it inspired many to buy a proper instrument. My 16-year-old daughter was one of them and now does not practise nearly enough. So Rocksmith, which costs $80 (£88 in the UK), provides her and others the opportunity to dust off and try afresh an underused purchase.The game comes with a special lead that plugs into a console USB port and has a standard quarter-inch jack for the guitar. Running the game on the television with our powerful home stereo, we were immediately impressed by the better sound of the guitar compared to when it is plugged into a paltry amp.Special effects are also unlocked as the game progresses.The player starts by tuning the guitar against a very accurate meter onscreen. This is essential as the game has to identify that you are playing the right notes, and there are frequent reminders to check tuning.The game then follows a similar course to Guitar Hero. We chose from a great selection of songs, such as the Rolling Stones’ “Satisfaction”, and representations of the notes rolled towards us on a series of conveyor belts, to be plucked as they hit an onscreen representation of the frets and strings.As well as awarding points for accuracy and unlocking new venues and other rewards, this is an instructional, educational game that starts slowly enough to cater for even complete beginners. Unlike the Stones, players should get plenty of satisfaction from Rocksmith.The Black Eyed Peas ExperienceUbisoft also has almost 75 per cent of the US market for dance games, principally because of the success of its Just Dance series.The problem
I liked to listen to the radio on my old phone, which had the FM band – what is the best way of listening to internet radio now I have a smartphone?The answer
Use your phone’s WiFi capability as much as possible to listen via hot spots if you are worried streaming audio may bust your data plan.There are many apps linking to radio stations around the world, but the best I have encountered is TuneIn, a free app covering 50,000 stations and available on every major platform. It can display current programme information and paying $1 for the Pro version is well worth it – it allows you to pause, rewind and record programmes.

Send your technology and gadget questions to chris.nuttall@ft.comAs a family, we got a good workout following the moves with an Xbox Kinect version of its Just Dance 3, second only to Call of Duty this year in sales on Amazon.com.We tried Abba You Can Dance on the Wii – loving the music, but finding the dance moves a little limited and old-fashioned.Our favourite was The Black Eyed Peas Experiencewith the Kinect. You have to like their music, but the characterisations of the dancers were the most impressive. The moves were challenging but the ability to follow dancers on stage facing the band was really helpful.PlayStation 3D DisplayI liked the concept of the PlayStation 3D Display as a dorm-room monitor and television substitute for video gamers when it was first unveiled, but it turns out to be a disappointment.The SimulView feature – in which, instead of the more usual split-screens of the action, two gamers see their own individual full-screen views thanks to a trick of the 3D glasses – is hard to set up and so far works on only a handful of games. After spending $500 (£410) on the display, a $70 second pair of the uncomfortable 3D glasses is needed for SimulView and a remote control costs an extra $25.Viewing 3D on the 24in screen is adequate if a little darkened and the stand for the display is very shaky. All in all, not Sony’s finest hour."
101;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-12-12T19:29:58Z;‘Call of Duty’ sales outstrip blockbuster films;;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, the latest instalment in Activision Blizzard’s hit war-game franchise, has realised $1bn-worth of sales in 16 days, outpacing blockbuster movies including Avatar and Harry Potter, but marking a slowdown after its record-breaking first week.MW3 outsold Activision’s two previous Call of Duty instalments, Black Ops and Modern Warfare 2, with $400m in first-day sales and $775m in its first five days, demonstrating the growing importance of a Hollywood-style opening weekend sales and marketing blitz.Activision is claiming a new high-water mark for video games in the entertainment wars by reaching $1bn in sales one day faster than 20th Century Fox’s Avatar, an indication of the ever-wider appeal of gaming beyond its teenage-boy origins. James Cameron’s 3D sci-fi epic set the previous record for reaching that milestone in 17 days in 2009, before going on to overtake Titanic as the biggest-grossing movie of all time, with total takings of $2.78bn, according to Box Office Mojo, the film website.Some industry observers have suggested that MW3’s stronger opening might lead to a faster fall-off in sales, after three-quarters of the 16-day total were achieved in the first five days.But Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, told the Financial Times that sales of Black Ops remained stronger than he expected a year after launch, due to online multiplayer gaming.“Those prior releases are continuing to sell at rates higher than what we’ve seen previously,” Mr Kotick said. “Even though MW3 is selling faster, the thing driving the success of those games is the social experience and online play.”Black Ops leads a ranking by NPD Group, which tracks American sales of the biggest-selling games titles in the US, with $900m in sales to date after selling $360m on its first day. Estimates suggest that MW3 has sold more than $500m in the US so far while Black Ops has sold around $1.4bn to date globally. NPD says MW3 US sales in November were 7 per cent higher than Black Ops during the same period last year.MW3’s $1bn global sales figure is largely comprised of physical disc sales but Activision’s new COD Elite online service, which provides extra statistics and add-ons for players, has also sold a little more than 1m premium subscriptions.The world’s two largest video-games companies are set to go head to head again next week with EA’s Star Wars: the Old Republic taking on Activision’s long-running massively popular multiplayer online game, World of Warcraft.
102;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-12-06T18:00:08Z;Hollywood tint to a very Modern Warfare;;The television advertisement for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, the new video game from Activision Blizzard, features movie stars Jonah Hill and Sam Worthington shooting their way through a landscape of urban destruction.Playing to a celebrity-obsessed culture where video games are increasingly mainstream, the widely-viewed clips and online viral videos helped propel the title to record sales of $400m on its first day.The showy Modern Warfare 3 ad also comes at a time when top tier video game releases are bigger than Hollywood blockbusters and game companies are looking to produce more television content that can be viewed by online gamers.Modern Warfare 3’s success is a testament to the enduring popularity of the “first person shooter” game, which in the 17 years since the release of Doom, the first popular title in the genre, has become a fixture on computers and game consoles such as the PlayStation and Xbox. Another big seller in recent weeks has been Battlefield 3, the new first-person shooter from Electronic Arts.But some analysts are concerned about the health of Activision’s main franchises. The online multiplayer World of Warcraft has lost 1m subscribers during the year. In addition some video game industry analysts are wondering if the Call of Duty franchise, which has sold more than 100m units overall, has peaked.Activision chief executive Bobby Kotick said in an interview with the Financial Times, however, that the first-person shooter category still had room to grow. “When you think of great game concepts, I think that unleashing your inner soldier is a great one,” he said. “There’s a lot to love about it.”The company reported strong quarterly earnings last month and raised its earnings forecast, but its shares have fallen more than 10 per cent since.The star-studded Modern Warfare 3 commercial was part of an unprecedented blitz of video game marketing. Electronic Arts spent heavily promoting Battlefield 3, and games such as Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Activision’s World of Warcraft with advertisements featuring actors including Chuck Norris.“The crowded release schedule triggered competitive behaviour, with more marketing spending than we have seen in past Novembers,” said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush. “We think that the huge marketing push from publishers and competitive retail climate could help sales throughout December.”Activision has partnered with Tony and Ridley Scott, the film directors, to create a TV programme called Friday Night Fights featuring highlights of Modern Warfare 3 game play. The show will be available for viewing on the Call of Duty Elite network, a new $50-a-year online social network.The Elite network, which Activision launched last month, stumbled out of the gate due to glitches brought on by high demand. But more than 1m users signed up in the first week, giving Activision a handsome new revenue stream.Other examples of video games embracing filmed content include Madden Nation, a reality show on Disney’s ESPN sports network that features gamers playing Electronic Arts’ Madden NFL game. Twitch.TV, a website launched earlier this year, features live broadcasts of video games and chat in online forums.“This is an important evolution of our medium,” said Mr Kotick, suggesting that Activision would release more television-style programming soon. “It would be logical to think you could produce [scripted content] that you could watch in the games.”One worry for analysts is that Activision does not yet have any major games on Facebook, while its main rival Electronic Arts has two of the top ten by users. Nor has Activision acquired any major social gaming companies. Electronic Arts bought Playfish in 2009, and Disney acquired Playdom last year. Zynga, the largest social gaming company, is preparing to go public. Mr Kotick said Activision was investing in the Facebook platform but had nothing to announce for the time being.However, the company is still working to develop new franchises with the release of Skylanders, a game targeted at children, which includes action figures that respond to the onscreen action. “Skylanders was this idea that you can bring your toys to life,” Mr Kotick said.Mr Kotick said Activision may not have enough supplies of the new game to meet holiday demand. But Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said that although it was on track to sell “reasonably well” it still had not cracked Amazon’s closely watched Top 20 titles.“With any new intellectual property, you never know how well it will be received,” Mr Kotick said of the Skylanders launch. “This was just something new.”
103;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-11-16T13:11:04Z;Game Group warns on further profit fall;;Game Group said it would post its first loss in a decade-and-a-half as the video-game retailer blamed “ wider consumer uncertainty” for its disappointing sales.Shares in Game lost almost half their value as investors took fright at the first UK high street retailer to warn on profits ahead of the crucial Christmas trading season.“We are facing the doubly whammy of very tough consumer spending and a cyclical low point in new hardware releases,” said Ian Shepherd, chief executive. “Our guidance today reflects the extraordinary economic times in which we are operating.”Mr Shepherd downgraded full-year performance from a projected fall in like-for-like sales of 0 to 3 per cent to “no better” than a 7 per cent decline, and that gross profit margins would decline by 150 basis points, rather than the 100 previously forecast.High street video-games retailers – of whom Game is Europe’s largest – have struggled amid increasing competition from supermarkets and the internet, as well as a dearth of large console launches. This year’s only console launch, Nintendo’s 3DS handheld, has not sold as well as expected, prompting a price cut shortly after its debut.Game said sales in the year to November 12 fell 8.6 per cent, on a like-for-like basis, although this outperformed the wider games market, which was down 12.3 per cent in the first 41 weeks of the year. Sales fell across all units, including hardware, software and accessories, although ecommerce revenues were flat, after the launch of a new web sales platform earlier this year.“Today a 10-year-old boy is probably playing Club Penguin or Moshi Monsters. If you’re a traditional retailer you don’t see that,” Mr Shepherd said referring to company’s “embryonic” digital division which saw revenues increase by 40 per cent.Only last week, Activision Blizzard declared that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3became the biggest-selling entertainment launch of all time, generating $400m in revenues in the first 24-hours on sale in the US and UK.But Mr Shepherd said that although other large software launches, which have included Electronic Arts’ Battlefield 3 and Fifa 12, have performed in line with expectations in the first week on sale, the retailer is seeing “a quicker tail-off than historically experienced”.Game now expects cost savings to be higher, contributing to improved cash generation.Analysts at Investec said on the basis of the update, they expected a pre-tax loss of £15m in the current financial year, with the dividend pay-out now “under threat”.The shares closed down 46 per cent at 10¼p in London.
104;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-11-16T10:59:40Z;Vivendi signals end of spending spree;;Vivendi has signalled that last week’s €1.4bn purchase of EMI’s recorded music division will probably be its last for a while as it responds to concerns about the €13.3bn net debt built up during its recent acquisition spree.The French telecommunications and media conglomerate, which owns assets ranging from the Call of Duty video game to a Brazilian telephone company, also cut this year’s net income target from €3bn to €2.85bn because of €350m of extra taxes imposed by France in its recent austerity budgets.However, the shares closed up 5.6 per cent at €16.34 after it said the net income target would have been €200m higher without the new taxes because of the contribution from Activision, maker of the successful Call of Duty franchise. It also promised to lift this year’s dividend and reduce debt to below €13bn by the end of December.Vivendi’s shares have lagged behind peers, partly because of concerns about the cash outlay on deals and some worries about whether this would affect shareholder payouts.The group has embarked on a string of recent deals, the biggest being the €7.8bn purchase of a 44 per cent stake from Vodafone in SFR, the French telecoms company.Philippe Capron, finance director, said acquisitions had left “very, very little headroom on the balance sheet” as he seeks to maintain Vivendi’s cherished triple-B credit rating.Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive, said a potential purchase of the 20 per cent stake in the Canal Plus television company held by rival Lagardère was “not the order of the day”.In the three months to September, sales fell 1.6 per cent to €6.8bn when compared with the same period last year. Net profit dropped 35 per cent to €241m. Operating profit beat expectations thanks to Activision and a one-off benefit at SFR, Vivendi’s biggest division.SFR’s mobile business is still suffering from intense domestic competition, which will increase next year with the market entry of Iliad’s Free Telecom.There was better news from Vivendi’s Universal Music, home to Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Justin Bieber, offering some justification for the EMI deal.Sales increased for the second quarter in a row as lower demand for physical music products was offset by higher licence income and an 11.3 per cent rise in digital sales.Polo Tang, UBS analyst, said: “The [music] market may be reaching an inflection point after a decade of decline.”Vivendi said £500m of asset disposals by Universal, to lower the EMI deal’s cost and ease competition worries, would lead to a loss in earnings of about €25m-€35m this year.The deal is expected to face hostile lobbying, notably in Brussels, where Impala, the association for smaller independent labels, opposes any deal that would strengthen Universal.Some analysts were disappointed that Vivendi sold a stake in Activision this week. Mr Capron denied that the “tactical” disposal had been carried out at the behest of credit rating agencies.
105;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-11-16T02:11:08Z;Vivendi sells $427m stake in Activision;;Vivendi has sold a $427m stake in Activision Blizzard, maker of the Call of Duty video game, raising questions about whether the French group has been stretched more than it has admitted by the $1.9bn purchase of EMI’s recorded music division.The French media and telecoms group denied on Tuesday night that the surprise sale of the 3 per cent holding in one of its prized assets had been prompted by rating agency worries about the deteriorating conditions in European credit markets.The latest Call of Duty title, Modern Warfare 3, recently became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, with 6.5m units sold in North America and the UK in the first 24 hours after its release.Vivendi also rejected suggestions that the sale was linked directly to the EMI deal, which was confirmed at the end of last week. It said the disposal, which cuts its holding in Activision from 63 per cent to 60 per cent, was “tactical” and had to do with improving the French company’s “overall capital structure”. The sale would bring its holding to the same level as at the start of this year,Vivendi added.However, media analysts at Bernstein Research said it was “quite natural” to connect the sale with the EMI purchase by Vivendi’s Universal Music and that the company’s desire to maintain its cherished triple-B credit rating could have encouraged it to “produce more hard cash”.Claudio Aspesi at Bernstein said: “The wisdom of selling about 3 per cent in a business that is one of the key bastions of growth for the group to aid a transformational acquisition in a challenged business, such as recorded music, seems questionable.”Vivendi’s shares have lagged in recent years, partly because of worries about its steady stream of acquisitions and the possible impact on its cash flow and dividend.The company has said it will sell €500m of non-core Universal assets to stay within its triple-B rating, but Mr Lévy told the Financial Times at the weekend that the disposals could yield more than that sum.He said Vivendi was attracted by “the limited competition from people who would have needed a lot of bank financing”, noting that it had been able to tap long-term financing secured after it bought Vodafone’s €8bn ($11bn) stake in SFR, a French telecoms company, in April.
106;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
107;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;‘Call of Duty MW3’ takes $400m on first day;;Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty franchise has again broken its own record for the “biggest entertainment launch” to date, with the latest instalment of the war-game franchise ringing up $400m (£250m) in first-day sales.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, the PC and console game released on Tuesday, sold 6.5m units in North America and the UK within 24 hours. That means Activision outstripped Electronic Arts’ rival title, Battlefield 3, which sold 5m copies in its first week upon release last month, making it the publisher’s fastest-selling game.Console games typically retail for several times more than a cinema ticket, complicating comparisons, but Activision says the sales figures make it the only entertainment franchise to set a new record three years in succession.In 2009, Modern Warfare 2 posted first-day sales of $310m and last year, Call of Duty: Black Ops sold $360m.The milestone demonstrates how blockbuster video game debuts are becoming more like Hollywood film premieres, complete with a star-studded launch party at London’s Old Billingsgate market, attended by footballers and musicians.“We believe the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the biggest entertainment launch of all time in any medium, and we achieved this record with sales from only two territories,” said Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, which is largely owned by Vivendi.“Other than Call of Duty, there has never been another entertainment franchise that has set opening day records three years in a row. Life-to-date sales for the Call of Duty franchise exceed worldwide theatrical box office for Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, two of the most successful entertainment franchises of all time.”Activision upped its 2011 forecasts earlier this week as Modern Warfare 3 went on sale. Analysts had predicted it would at least match the 25m total sales of Black Ops.However, Activision is grappling with falling subscriptions at another large franchise, the online subscription game World of Warcraft.
108;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-11-08T23:49:44Z;‘Call of Duty’ to spearhead Activision advance;;Activision Blizzard raised its 2011 forecasts as the most highly anticipated video game of the year, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, went on sale and the publisher reported strong demand for a new toy-based title targeted at the holiday season.The world’s largest video game publisher by revenues said there had been an unprecedented level of pre-orders for the latest title in the Call of Duty franchise and a stronger than expected consumer response to Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventures, where smart action figures interact with the game.Modern Warfare 3 went on sale in the early hours of Tuesday with midnight store openings. Amazon reported more pre-orders for the game than any other in the online retailer’s history.Video game analysts at Wedbush Securities forecast that Modern Warfare 3 will at least match the 25m units sold of its predecessor, Call of Duty: Black Ops. On its first day a year ago, 5.6m units were sold. Revenues of $360m set a one-day record for any entertainment property.The publisher, based in Santa Monica, California, publisher raised its calendar-year revenue guidance by $200m to $4.25bn and increased its earnings per share forecast from 77 to 85 cents.Activision also reported third-quarter figures well ahead of Wall Street expectations. Sales of $627m compared with an analyst consensus of $558m. Earnings of 7 cents a share, compared with 2 cents a share expected by analysts.However, Activision shares fell 3 per cent to $13.48 in extended trading in New York after the company’s Blizzard division reported continuing and more rapid declines in subscriptions to another mainstay – the World of Warcraft online role-playing game.Global subscriptions, which were over 12m at the start of the year, declined to 10.3m in the third quarter, down 7 per cent from 11.1m in the second quarter.Mike Morhaime, Blizzard president, said the majority of the declines were coming from the Asia, where China represented more than half of the global player base. He told analysts a number of initiatives, including marketing promotions and content improvements, were planned.Learning from the success of World of Warcraft’s subscription model, Activision launched Call of Duty Elite on Tuesday, with a $50-a-year premium subscription for the social network for players of the game. Activision said it was struggling to cope with demand for the new service, with more than 1m people already registered.Bobby Kotick, chief executive, told the Financial Times that supplies were already tight for some of the 32 different characters that can be bought to be played in the Skylander game, with the company and toy retailers not expecting such strong sales ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday – the game was released in mid-October.“It’s shaping up to be not only the most in-demand game for six to 11-year-olds but also the most in-demand toy – those sales have been great,” he said.

I am now back to a 1.5 per cent gain since January. Notably, it is the main-market shares in my individual savings account (Isa) that have taken the biggest hit: Aviva, C&W Worldwide, Fenner, Titon and Treatt are all down on July. By contrast, my larger non-Isa portfolio – mainly in Alternative Investment Market (Aim) companies – has held up better, delivering a 7.5 per cent appreciation since January: stocks such as Christie Group, Concurrent Technologies, Delcam, Nichols, Northbridge, Park Group, THB, FW Thorpe, and Wynnstay are all up. I have also benefited from the takeover of Capital Pub. Perhaps those who are still sniffy about Aim stocks generally should reflect on these little gems – they are established, conservative, profitable, growing, and inheritance-tax free!Dina IordanovaPerformance year-to-date: -6 per centI have been on quite a few trips over the past few months – to France, Germany, Spain, Bulgaria and South Korea. But, while good in other respects, these travels have been disruptive to my investing pursuits.Given the current levels of volatility, getting reliable information is key. Unfortunately, my main broker has been incapable of providing correct information on closing prices outside of working hours – making it almost impossible to trade while on the road. And while the internet is everywhere, it comes at a price: while free in Busan, Seoul and the Basque country, the charges for access were excessive at hotels in Bavaria, adding unwanted trading costs.My best performing investments include Activision, Pan African Resources, Eros International, and Reed Elsevier. Barclays is the most considerable laggard.Kevin Goldstein-JacksonPerformance year-to-date: -7.4 per centMy self-invested personal pension (Sipp) has suffered from playing safe. For example, I kept my holding in Weir Group unchanged. Yet on numerous occasions it would have been possible to have made quick “in and out” profits of £1, £2 or more per share.There were other companies from which profits could have been made but I only added two new ones to the portfolio: Aim-listed Epistem and PLUS-Market listed book publisher Quercus.Worst performers included Lonmin (£19.66 at the start of the year down to £10.80) and Oak Holdings. My holding in Lonmin is small, following good profits from share sales over the years. Oak’s share price was down to 1p when, on October 21, the company announced a “temporary suspension” of its shares pending clarification of the sudden termination of a contract. But my Sipp’s holding in Oak is tiny.Good performers included pharmaceuticals firm BTG (up from 231.4p to 268p) and Athelney (115p to 126p).Nick LouthPerformance year-to-date:

But the deal as agreed is only the first step in a process that has not addressed the main problems: Greece and Italy’s inability to live within their means.So I have taken the opportunity to sell my most cyclical and volatile holdings into the rally over the past two weeks.

110;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-08-31T08:04:03Z;Games sales offset music falls at Vivendi;;Increasing sales of digital games such as World of Warcraft and Call of Duty helped Vivendi offset lower earnings at its Universal music business and its French and Moroccan mobile operators in the six months to June.The media and telecommunications group, which recently completed a long-running restructuring, was also helped by strong sales of broadband and voice services at GVT, its Brazilian unit.That was in contrast to SFR, its domestic French telecoms operator, where earnings before interest, taxation and amortisation fell 8 per cent to €1.94bn ($2.8bn), largely because of increased price competition and a VAT increase.In Morocco, earnings at Vivendi’s Maroc Telecoms fell 11 per cent because of a slight decline in sales, though profit margins remained high.Earlier this year Vivendi spent €8bn buying Vodafone’s 44 per cent stake in SFR, a price some analysts said was more expensive than the level at which telecoms peers were trading. But Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi’s chief executive, insisted on Wednesday that the purchase “achieved an essential strategic objective on very favourable financial terms”.He added that “we now have full control of all our assets and have simplified our organisation”.SFR, along with peers France Telecom and Bouygues Telecom, is facing even tougher competition in its home market, with the imminent arrival of Iliad’s Free Telecom as a fourth mobile rival.Universal, whose roster includes Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Rihanna, suffered a 2 per cent fall in sales to €1.86bn and a 17 per cent drop in ebita to €132m. Like industry peers, it has been struggling with internet downloading but reported a 13.5 per cent increased in digital music sales. Mr Lévy said he would look into buying parts of EMI, Universal’s struggling rival.Vivendi was lifted by a strong performance at Activision Blizzard, its games company. Ebita rose 34 per cent to €833m, driven by record sales of online franchises such as World of Warcraft. The company is planning new Call of Duty releases later this year, both for games consoles and online. It said pre-orders for Modern Warfare 3, whose launch was expected in November, have “significantly exceeded” pre-orders for its predecessor Black Ops.GVT, the Brazilian telecoms operator bought by Vivendi in 2009, also performed well, with earnings rising 91 per cent to €187m.Overall, Vivendi sales rose 2 per cent during the period to €14.25bn, while ebita rose 3.7 per cent. Adjusted net income rose 20 per cent to €1.83bn, though this was inflated by a tax impact from the SFR purchase.Mr Lévy remained confident about the rest of the year “despite the turbulent economic and financial environment”.
111;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;‘Black Ops’ keeps winning for Activision;;Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video games publisher by revenues, reported a 66 per cent increase in second-quarter profits, boosted by continuing sales of its record-breakingCall of Duty: Black Ops title.Activision also raised its guidance for the full year and said pre-orders for Black Ops’ holiday-season successor – Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 – “significantly exceeded” those for Black Ops at the same time a year agoThe publisher, based in Santa Monica, California, reported profits of 10 cents a share, up from 6 cents a year earlier and double those expected by Wall Street. Revenues of $699m beat analyst forecasts of $599m.Activision shares rose more than 4 per cent to $12.34 in after-hours trading on the news. It raised its full-year revenue guidance by $100m to $4.05bn and earnings per share from 73 cents to 77 cents.Black Ops became the biggest entertainment launch in history last November when it recorded $650m in sales in its first five days. The publisher has continued to earn substantial revenues from it, long after the release, with the sale of downloadable map packs that add new battlefields for players.Activision has been placing increasing emphasis on these higher-margin digital sales that follow on from the sale of “packaged goods” discs – its World of Warcraft franchise earns most of its revenues from players paying a monthly subscription to continue to explore its online world.The publisher said its better-than-expected performance was “driven by record digital sales of our online-enabled franchises”.Bobby Kotick, chief executive, told an analyst conference call that a majority of his employees were now dedicated to online services.“We continue to shift our business towards digital delivery of content and services that establish direct ongoing relationships with our audiences,” he said.The release of Modern Warfare 3 in November will be accompanied by the launch of Call of Duty Elite, an online service with a premium subscription element for multiplayer games, while one involving digital micro-transactions is to be launched in China.In a Financial Times interview, Mr Kotick said the company’s strategy would help it cope with a “unique set of challenges in the next five years”.“It’s hard to determine how many internet-enabled televisions will be able to support a rich gaming experience five years from now. We need to figure out ways to compete with free [games] and how to differentiate our content from the hundreds of thousands of other games out there on [Apple] iOS and Android devices,” he said.
112;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-07-13T00:35:31Z;EA extends digital push with PopCap deal;;Electronic Arts is paying up to $1.35bn for PopCap Games, the maker of Plants vs Zombies, as the console-based publisher expands into the faster-growing casual gaming sector.The deal to buy PopCap follows its acquisition of Chillingo, publisher of the Angry Birds game, for about $20m last October and a $400m deal to buy social gaming company Playfish in 2009.EA, the largest video game publisher by revenues after Activision Blizzard, has been placing more emphasis on digital revenues as opposed to its traditional “packaged goods” business of discs for console games.“PopCap’s great studio talent and powerful [intellectual property] add to EA’s momentum and accelerate our drive towards a $1bn digital business,” said John Riccitiello, EA chief executive.Compared with rivals such as four-year-old Zynga, Seattle-based PopCap is a veteran independent developer of casual games.Founded in 2000, it employs 475 people and has become a hit factory led by the success of Bejeweled, a puzzle game in which the objective is to form chains of gems, which has sold more than 50m units.Follow-up successes have included Peggle, Bookworm, Zuma and its latest casual gaming blockbuster Plants vs Zombies, in which vegetation fights stumbling hordes of possessed creatures.“We picked EA because they have recast their culture around making great digital games,” said David Roberts, chief executive of PopCap.“By working with EA, we’ll scale our games and services to deliver more social, mobile, casual fun to an even bigger, global audience.”More than 80 per cent of PopCap’s sales are on digital platforms, including Facebook, the iPhone and Android smartphones.EA hopes PopCap will help it expand its business on these platforms as well as into new ones such as smart televisions and new regions such as Asia.Social and mobile game revenues are expected to grow 32 per cent and 24 per cent a year respectively between 2010 and 2014, while console game sales are expected to fall by 2 per cent a year, according to forecasts by analysts at Think Equity.The Silicon Valley company is paying $650m in cash and $100m in EA stock to the founders and chief executive of PopCap, while offering up to $50m in stock to retain management in the next four years, and up to $550m in cash for achieving earnings targets.EA shares, which are up nearly 50 per cent this year, fell by 3.5 per cent to $23.34 in extended trading on the news.The company also announced preliminary results for its quarter ending June 30, with sales between $500m and $525m ahead of previous guidance of between $460m and $500m.
113;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-07-01T23:22:28Z;Zynga’s small beginnings to empire building;;Building and defending empires is the subject of Zynga’s latest hit title. It is also something founder and chief executive Mark Pincus is achieving in his real life in the booming social gaming industry.A playful character himself, Mr Pincus wrote a “Dear potential Zynga shareholders” letter in the company’s filing for an initial public offering on Friday, imitating the practice of Andrew Mason, Groupon chief executive, in the online coupon company’s recent filing and Larry Page, Google’s co-founder, when it went public.Like Google, he stressed a long-term strategy, saying that the share offering allowed it “to invest more in play than any company in history”.He pledged: “We will make decisions and trade-offs that are different from other companies. We will prioritise innovation and long-term growth over quarterly earnings.”That strategy will be harder to pursue in public, once the company is under more intense scrutiny, than it has been in private, but it has served Mr Pincus well so far.“He’s on a mission to build the biggest game company ever built and the best game company ever built,” says Marc Andreessen, a Zynga investor.The entrepreneur founded Zynga in 2007, naming it after his late American bulldog, and it has grown to 2,000 staff over the past four and a half years.Although the start-up may be viewed as riding on the back of Facebook’s success and its 700m users, many have ridden this tiger yet none has succeeded to the extent Zynga has.Zynga has 280m monthly players of its Facebook games, according to AppData, more than eight times those of its nearest rivals – Europe’s Wooga and Electronic Arts, which bought Zy.It is valued at $15.4bn, according to the SharesPost private exchange, making it worth more than Activision Blizzard, the biggest traditional games company, with hits such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft spanning consoles and PCs.Zynga’s success is more narrowly based, with CityVille attracting 88m players a month as the leading social game on Facebook, and its newest hit Empires & Allies, launched last month, acquiring 45m players.The games are more simple than console ones, with activities such as building houses and communities and growing crops. The maintenance involved and regular rewards make them addictive, leading to purchases of virtual goods, such as tractors and mansions, to enhance the experience.Zynga has been adept at analysing players’ behaviour and tweaking content and gameplay accordingly.“Zynga should not just be viewed as a gaming company, but one that can engineer behaviour through a systematic process of gathering data and using that to refine its games. It’s not just about designing cute figures and a cute storyline,” says Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner research.However, analysts fear producing formulaic games will wear thin. There has been some “cannibalisation” as FarmVille users moved to CityVille, and “churn” as users stopped playing Empires & Allies, perhaps turned off by the new combat element. Being so dependent on Facebook limits Zynga – Facebook has no access to the Chinese market, for example, which has a huge interest in gaming.Additional reporting by Richard Waters and April Dembosky
114;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Activision’s hit for the holidays;;Pop quiz question – what Activision Blizzard game will make the biggest waves this holiday season?Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the obvious answer, but Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, gave me a different one at E3 this week.Skylanders.Yes, this game which combines a smart toy with a video game is likely to be at the top of the Christmas wish list for six to 11-year-old boys this Christmas, according to retailers like Toys “R” Us, Walmart and GameStop.“The retailers are saying the biggest thing for kids this holidays will be Skylanders,” he told me.This came as a surprise to the world’s biggest third-party game publisher, which is entering unknown territory with a game it first announced at the American International Toy Fair in February.The action figures, which include Spyro the dragon, are in fact inter-action figures that are placed on an illuminated ring known as the Portal of Power attached to a console. This transports them into the game on screen, with memory chips inside the figures able to store progress and achievements.With Walmart planning to feature the game in its video game, toy and general merchandise sections, Activision’s biggest problem could be producing enough of the figures to satisfy demand.The company should find it easier to scale up for its new Call of Duty Elite online service , which begins in beta in July, although it has been inundated by 1.6m signups within a week.There has been some adverse reaction from consumers over Activision’s plans to charge a monthly subscription for premium access to the service, but Mr Kotick was at pains to stress that no pricing had yet been finalised and there would be a great deal of content in the free version of Elite.“This is the most extensively researched product that we’ve ever done, audience feedback has been very positive, we’ve designed it to be an incredible value for our customers,” he said.Nevertheless, analysts have warned the Call of Duty franchise could lose some market share to Electronic Arts’ Battlefield 3 later this year, with EA’s online Battle Log service being a free offering.Battlefield 3 will be released on October 25, two weeks ahead of Modern Warfare 3, but the Activision chief says the level of interest in trailers for the game suggests Call of Duty will continue to dominate.“Every indication is that it’s likely to be hugely successful,” he said.

116;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-05-12T22:38:45Z;Vivendi beats expectations in first quarter;;Profits at Vivendi were boosted by the integration of its telecoms business and dividends from the sale of its stake in NBC Universal as the French group reported first-quarter results.Adjusted net income rose 29.1 per cent to €950m ($14.bn) on sales up 3.8 per cent to €7.2bn compared with the same period last year.The results were “slightly better than expected”, said Conor O’Shea, media analyst at Kepler.Vivendi added that adjusted net income for 2011, excluding the impact of its sale of the NBC Universal stake for $5.8bn and before the acquisition of the remaining 44 per cent of its telecoms business SFR from Vodafone for €7.95bn increased slightly.Sales at SFR were broadly flat on a like-for-like basis at €3.06bn, while mobile revenue declined 2.4 per cent to €2.13bn.The fiercely competitive French telecoms market was challenged in the period by a rise in value added tax for triple play services, but like rivals France Telecom and Bouygues Telecom, SFR pledged not to pass on price increases to its customers.Vivendi secured full ownership of SFR last month following a deal with Vodafone which it said would lead to an increased dividend.Activision Blizzard, Vivendi’s leading video game publisher responsible for World of Warcraft, was once again a strong performer recording a 12.3 per cent jump in sales to €1.06bn.However GVT, a broadband provider Vivendi acquired in Brazil two years ago, was the star performer with a 53.7 per cent increase in sales to €329m.Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi’s chairman, told the Financial Times this week that it was looking for further acquisitions in Brazil.However, investors should not expect “major acquisitions”, Vivendi added on Thursday, saying that it would be more interested in greenfield or start-up developments.
117;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-05-11T15:15:03Z;Vivendi targets further Brazil acquisitions;;Vivendi is hunting down further acquisitions in Brazil as the French group looks to build on GVT, the small but fast-growing Brazilian telecoms operator it bought for €2.8bn in 2009.A month after its €8bn ($11bn) buy-out of Vodafone’s stake in SFR, the French mobile telecoms joint venture, Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi’s chairman, told the Financial Times he saw little urgency in eliminating another minority stake by buying the 20 per cent of its Canal+ pay-television business owned by Lagardère.Instead, he said in an interview on the eve of Vivendi’s first-quarter earnings, the group wanted to invest “to fill the pipes” of GVT with content and services. “Brazil is going to be an important growth driver for us,” he said, describing the market as “almost untapped”.Vivendi, whose assets range from Universal Music to Activision Blizzard, was looking at investments “across the digital ecosystem” in Brazil, he said, and could buy companies outside its current areas of expertise in telecoms, pay-TV, music and video games.GVT’s revenues rose 43 per cent in 2010 in local currency terms to €1.03bn, driven by 80 per cent growth in broadband revenues, and operating margins improved despite a doubling of capital expenditures to fund faster broadband speeds and a roll-out to 13 more cities. GVT is taking on the far larger Telefónica and América Móvil, and its capital expenditure is due to rise by another 40 per cent this year.The Brazilian group also struck its first deal with another division of its French parent company, launching a free music and video service with Universal Music for GVT broadband customers. Many music executives remain wary of Brazil’s relatively high levels of piracy, however.Mr Lévy has sought to reduce Vivendi’s conglomerate discount by selling its 20 per cent minority stake in NBC Universal for $5.8bn last year and taking full control of SFR. However, he said he felt no pressure to resolve the ownership of Canal+, where Lagardère has the right to force an initial public offering if it cannot agree terms for Vivendi to buy its stake.The two companies have been haggling for months over valuations of the stake reported to range between €1bn and €1.8bn, and Lagardère began preparing an IPO after Vivendi declined its demand for a price of €1.3bn.Canal+ was “a very minor issue” compared to SFR, Mr Lévy said, noting its smaller size and the fact that Vivendi already consolidates all the cash flow from the business. “I would prefer that it were not listed but if it is listed we will live with it,” he said.
118;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-05-11T14:26:50Z;Vivendi chief still has keen eye on media;;Vivendi’s buy-out of Vodafone’s stake in SFR, its domestic mobile business, marks the end of the restructuring of the French communications group’s portfolio, Jean-Bernard Lévy said. “It took a long time,” he adds, with a rueful laugh.The 56-year-old alumnus of the Ecole Polytechnique has spent much of his eight and a half years as Vivendi’s chief executive and then chairman unravelling the legacy of Jean-Marie Messier, whose controversial attempts to transform the former utility company into a transatlantic media and telecoms powerhouse left the company crippled by debt.His moves to clean up Vivendi’s portfolio, such as cutting the last tie to Mr Messier’s Hollywood dreams by selling its stake in NBC Universal, have helped erase those memories, but investors still react warily to the company’s acquisitions.When Vivendi announced the €8bn SFR deal last month, its shares barely moved. Instead of rewarding the company for reducing its conglomerate discount, several analysts queried why Vivendi had paid a multiple of between 6.2 and 6.7 times SFR’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation when telecoms peers were trading closer to 5 times.In a Sofitel hotel in midtown Manhattan, Mr Lévy says he paid an above-market price as he thought the market was “grossly exaggerating” the risks new regulations and taxes pose to European telecom operators, notably in mobile.With a higher value added tax bill to pay in France, and with Iliad due to enter SFR’s market as a fourth mobile operator next year, he acknowledges: “It’s tough, but it’s not apocalyptic.”Iliad’s entry to the French mobile market is “already priced in”, he claims, arguing that the cash flow declines assumed by the sector’s multiple are now so steep as to make the valuation “stupid”.Mr Lévy is not alone among chairmen in thinking his company is undervalued, but he faces the challenge that this year will see only modest earnings growth at Vivendi, due to factors ranging from regulatory pressures at SFR to fewer blockbuster releases at its Activision Blizzard video games business.Instead, he would like investors to see the SFR deal as the completion of a three-year process in which Vivendi swapped a passive stake in NBC Universal for full control of SFR, in a way that should be clearly accretive to its earnings.Some have seen the deal, which followed 2009’s acquisition of GVT in Brazil, as a sign that Vivendi is abandoning its media ambitions to focus on telecoms. Mr Lévy, who struck the merger that created Activision Blizzard and has spent months grappling with Lagardère over the future of its holding in Canal+, dismisses the idea.“I strongly disagree with the [idea of a] split between telecoms and media. I believe this is a 1990s concept,” he says. On platforms such as GVT’s broadband network, there is an increasing need for content and services, he argues, and Vivendi needs to excel in both areas.“I don’t like the word ‘synergies’, [but] we have an understanding of content creation, aggregation, publishing and network technology,” he says. That dual focus extends to its acquisition strategy, he signals, confirming that Vivendi’s Universal Music arm watched the recent auction for Warner Music closely and hinting that it hoped to buy parts of EMI when the UK music group is sold by Citigroup.“We cannot buy all of EMI [but] we’ll always be looking at recorded music assets,” Mr Lévy says. Despite tumbling CD sales, piracy, and the industry’s difficulties in agreeing terms with new digital entrants from Google to Spotify, “we believe the music industry is valuable,” he says.In music and in games, Vivendi still faces rapid changes in technology and in consumer behaviour that require swift responses.When Activision Blizzard, the group behind World of Warcraft, released its latest hit, Call of Duty: Black Ops, it shipped too many physical copies, he admits, because it underestimated the number of players who would choose to download the game instead.But Vivendi has no plan to jump on the casual gaming phenomenon of the moment, Mr Lévy says: “People say ‘You don’t have Angry Birds’, but I sell more in one week [at Activision Blizzard] than the revenues of Angry Birds in one year.”Additional reporting by Andrew Parker and Ben Fenton in London
119;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-05-10T01:26:35Z;Activision call of duty to console makers;;Activision Blizzard’s chief executive Bobby Kotick would prefer console makers to focus more on their online networks than next-generation machines when the video game industry gathers for its big E3 convention next month.In a sideways reference to Sony’s problems with its PlayStation Network and Nintendo’s plans to unveil its next-generation console, Mr Kotick told me during a call to discuss first-quarter earnings that the growth of digital sales was changing the game, so to speak.“The industry is evolving – we had more than 50 per cent of our revenues from digital this quarter – and one of the things you realise is that there’s less of a need for new hardware when people become much more enthusiastic about the online components of the game,” he said.“The platform used to be defined as just the box, but the platform today is really the box plus all the online services and capabilities.”The Activision boss said the continued downtime of the PlayStation Network after a security breach was having an impact on sales, but not one that materially affected the company’s financial results.The company released Call of Duty:Black Ops First Strike, a downloadable content pack with five new battlefields, on February 1 and saw it downloaded 1.4m times in the first 24 hours on Xbox Live.A second content pack, Black Ops Escalation, was released last week on Xbox Live and Activision hopes to sell it in the PlayStation Store later in the quarter, if the PlayStation network can be restored.Activision raised its guidance for the calendar year by $50m to $3.95bn in revenues and by 3 cents to 73 cents a share in profits.“We’ve more confidence in consumer spending, we feel like some of that has stabilised and there are price cuts on the [console] hardware in the works,” said Mr Kotick.The company should unveil details of Beachhead, a separate online platform for the Call of Duty franchise that has been two years in development, at E3 in Los Angeles next month.The financial figures for the fourth and first quarters demonstrate how add-on digital sales can sustain a publisher after initial disk-based sales have faded.When Call of Duty:Black Ops went on sale in the busiest holiday quarter, Activision recorded $1.88bn in sales in the retail channel or 73 per cent of total revenues, with $0.48bn in digital sales. In the quieter first quarter, retail sales were only $0.24bn or 32 per cent of revenues, compared to the $0.44bn in digital sales.
120;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-04-05T22:03:02Z;Vivendi denies telecoms focus;;Vivendi’s €8bn acquisition of Vodafone’s minority stake in mobile operator SFR does not mean its primary focus is now on telecoms, the French conglomerate’s chief executive said.“This is not a sign that we will become a telco,” Jean-Bernard Lévy told the Financial Times on Tuesday.“Yes, the telecoms business will be a larger part of the group than content production and publishing, but there’s a lot of value in that chain.”The deal – at a higher price than some analysts had predicted – will see Vivendi take on the 44 per cent of SFR that it did not already own, in keeping with a drive to focus on its controlled operations and shed non-core minority holdings.In January, Vivendi disposed of a 20 per cent stake in entertainment group NBC Universal for $5.8bn.“We have for several years said we wanted full control [of SFR],” Mr Lévy said. “We are an industrial company, not a financial company. We’re actively managing the companies…we don’t have any money stuck in something we cannot control.”Analysts had suggested possible benefits from the deal for Canal Plus, Vivendi’s pay television operation, but Mr Lévy played down the idea. “We do not believe there will be any immediate synergies,” he said. “A few months ago we started to sell Canal Plus in SFT stores, and that was a great success [but] we are not planning to increase this co-operation.”Full ownership of SFR would see an increase in dividends at Vivendi, he added, but there were no plans for further acquisitions, with a planned emphasis on “internal innovation”.“We have achieved a major turning point in the way we manage our assets over the last few years,” he said. “We are allocating capital to have a simpler Vivendi, one better equipped to offer all these new services.”He drew attention to Vivendi’s music merchandising operations, and a growing internet TV business in France.However, Conor O’Shea, a Paris-based media analyst at Kepler, said it was “disingenuous” to deny that Vivendi was moving towards becoming a telecoms business.“This transaction will mean that they now go into the telco indices, and can tap into larger funds,” he said. “It changes the perception of the stock.”Mr O’Shea also challenged Mr Lévy’s account of the reasoning behind the deal, saying that it would not affect the running of SFR. “The operational parts of Vivendi run without much interference from the holding company,” he said. “This is purely a financial transaction.”Vivendi’s other interests include a 57 per cent stake in video games producer Activision Blizzard, and full ownership of GVT, a Brazilian broadband provider.
121;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-03-01T13:56:33Z;Vivendi to push ahead with French buy-backs;;Vivendi is to push ahead with its strategy to gain full ownership of its French entities, but not at any cost, the conglomerate said on Tuesday.As the group reported a 4.4 per cent higher net profit of €2.7bn ($3.7bn) on sales of €28.9bn for 2010, Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive, said: “They must be done at a reasonable price – we will walk away from expensive deals”.Analysts expect that Vivendi, which received $5.8bn from selling its NBC Universal stake in January, will attempt to acquire from Vodafone the 44 per cent stake it does not own in SFR, France’s second largest mobile operator, as part of a drive to consolidate ownership in its domestic market.The media conglomerate also wants to acquire a 20 per cent stake in Canal Plus from Lagardère, the French publishing group.Mr Lévy said Vivendi “achieved good results in 2010” in spite of the difficult economic conditions, with growth coming from the company’s emerging markets.He said: “We know organic growth will come from fast-growing economies”.GVT, a broadband provider Vivendi acquired in Brazil in 2009, was now a “significant part of the company,” he added with full year revenue of €1.029bn. Vivendi also recorded a 5.2 per cent sales rise for its Moroccan telecoms activities to €2.835bn.Conor O’Shea, media analyst at Kepler, said: “The market wants to see them do something with the cash, and buying out the minorities of SFR and Canal Plus still seems the most likely option”.Sales were also boosted by a strong performance in Activision Blizzard, Vivendi’s majority-owned video games company, which grew by 9.6 per cent on an annual basis to €3.33bn.Vivendi said it was consolidating its ownership of Activision Blizzard through a share buy-back, which currently brings the group close to 61 per cent ownership.However mobile revenue in Vivendi’s core SFR business declined 0.6 per cent to €8.93bn.Mr O’Shea said: “The main uncertainty concerns SFR, where they forecast between a 0 per cent and 10 per cent decline in their [earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortisation] for the mobile business. If the decline is at the upper end of that range they may have to scramble in their other businesses in order to meet guidance”.Mr Lévy refused to be drawn on whether Universal Music Group would be bidding for Warner Music, which asked for preliminary bids for its music publishing company or the entire group ten days ago, or if it would bid for EMI which is also expected to come up for sale this year.Mr O’Shea said: “It is doubtful they will try to buy the entire business but they may decide to cherry pick elements, such as certain labels or parts of the music publishing businesses”.The group also provided further guidance on its provisions for damages it might pay to shareholders in a US court case, following the decision by a New York court last week which limited the claims which could be brought against the group. It reduced it to €100m from the €550m originally forecast.The group said it expected adjusted net income to register a slight increase in 2011.Diluted earnings per share increased from €0.69 to €1.78. Vivendi proposed an unchanged dividend of €1.40.
122;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-02-10T23:09:39Z;Cisco results weigh on Wall Street;;Lacklustre quarterly earnings from Cisco Systems dragged on technology stocks but, in the wider markets, a stronger materials sector balanced out losses.The networking equipment maker tumbled 14.2 per cent to $18.92 after reporting that its profit margin had fallen because of its push into new markets.In spite of the decline in margins, Cisco’s overall revenue for the second quarter was $10.4bn, or 37 cents a share, above Wall Street’s expectations of $10.23bn, or 39 cents a share.Cisco has seen an average fall in price of 6.9 per cent in the past four quarters after releasing their earnings results, according to Whisper Numbers, an equity research firm.The weak results weighed on the technology sector, which was the worst performing in the session. The S&P technology index was down 2 per cent to 473.51.The S&P 500 closed fractionally up at 1,321.87 as losses among techs were balanced out by stronger materials stocks on reports that Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian president, might step down on Thursday evening.The S&P materials index was up 0.3 per cent. Among the winners was Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coalminer, which gained 2 per cent to $88.45.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent to 12,229.29, ending a eight session winning streak, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,790.45.Confidence on Wall Street was not helped by mixed earnings reports.PepsiCo reported core earnings per share of $1.05 per diluted share compared with Wall Street’s consensus forecast of $1.04, excluding the impact of its takeover of its two largest bottlers.Its shares fell 1.6 per cent to $63.36. The news weighed on related stocks. Dr Pepper Snapple was down 3.5 per cent to $33.96 while the S&P beverage sector lost 0.5 per cent.NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, softened slightly after jumping 14 per cent in the previous session on news that it was in advanced-stage merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.NYSE was down 0.8 per cent to $37.80 but the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s primary options-trading venue, rose 5.3 per cent to $26.87.
123;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-02-10T02:19:10Z;Activision pulls cord on ‘Guitar Hero’;;Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest games publisher, is abandoning its Guitar Hero franchise after a collapse in sales over the past two years.Los Angeles-based Activision added that it would not this year produce a new version of its Tony Hawk skateboarding game, which has appeared annually since 1999. Development has also been halted on the game True Crime: Hong Kong, as the company said it was moving to become a “leaner and more focused organisation”.Guitar Hero was largely responsible for $1.7bn in sales in the music genre for video games in 2008 as the craze for copying well-known licks with a realistic guitar controller peaked.Sales fell 50 per cent in 2009 and have settled to about $300m annually for music and dance rhythm games.“Demand for peripheral-based music games has declined at a dramatic pace,” Eric Hirshberg, head of Activision Publishing, told an analyst conference call.There had been two years of steeply declining sales, he said, including for the latest DJ Hero 2 and Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, despite achieving high ratings from game reviewers.In spite of their failure in the fourth quarter, Activision topped analyst expectations of $2.35bn in revenues and earnings per share of 51 cents, with sales worth $2.55bn and profits of 53 cents a share.However, Activision shares fell about 7.5 per cent in extended trading in New York to $10.80 on disappointing guidance.It predicted $640m in revenues for the first quarter and earnings of 7 cents per share against Wall Street expectations of $735m and 10 cents.The company said that it would “reduce its exposure to low-margin and low-potential businesses” in 2011. Its Guitar Hero business unit was being disbanded and development on the game was being discontinued, it said.In another sign of the music game genre’s distress, Viacom is reported to have sold the developer Harmonix in December for the price of one of its Rock Band games, $49.99.Activision said it would focus on key franchises such as its Call of Duty “first-person shooter” and the online role-playing game World of Warcraft.World of Warcraft had 12m gamers worldwide paying regular subscriptions as of December 31.
124;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2011-02-02T01:19:38Z;EA shares rise after buy-back pledge;;Shares in Electronic Arts rose almost 10 per cent on news of a $600m share buy-back and signs that its digital strategy was paying off.EA, the second-largest video game publisher, reported 39 per cent growth in digital revenues year-on-year in its December quarter and said it was on track to hit its target of $750m in digital sales for the fiscal year ending in March.The Silicon Valley company has been exploring games platforms from the iPhone to the Kindle e-reader for higher growth markets than its packaged-goods disc-based business, where industry revenues fell 4 per cent last year.EA said Scrabble outsold every book to become the number-one selling item for the Kindle at the end of December, while Angry Birds, published by its Chillingo acquisition, was the number-one game on the iPhone and iPad in 2010.“We’re in the process of transforming our business from a packaged goods business to a digital one,” said Eric Brown, chief financial officer, in an FT interview.Downloadable expansion packs for its console games Fifa 11 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2 boosted third-quarter digital revenues to $211m, making 15 per cent of total revenues of $1.41bn – slightly below analyst expectations of $1.44bn. Earnings per share of 59 cents were 2 cents ahead of Wall Street’s forecast.EA said two of its December quarter titles – Medal of Honor and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit – had already sold more than 5m units to the retail channel.Mr Brown added that EA had sunk substantial development costs into Star Wars. EA has high hopes of digital subscription revenues from this online multiplayer game, which will launch this year and compete with Activision Blizzard’s dominant World of Warcraft franchise.EA said it would carry out share buy-backs worth $600m in the next 18 months to benefit its long-term investors, who have had a rough ride with the shares down more than 70 per cent in the past five years. Its shares rose as much as 9.7 per cent to $17.13 in after-hours trading in New York.
125;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-12-13T09:50:50Z;Computer games;Digital downloads offer hope for struggling sellers;"Virtual goods have been creating bother for centuries – at least since the sale of papal indulgences sparked the Reformation. With online computer games, the scope to sell the intangible has expanded enormously – from virtual money in FarmVille on Facebook to the highly addictive alternative reality provided by World of Warcraft. Those to suffer this time are the businesses that sell computer games as packaged goods: the share price for Electronic Arts, the second-biggest US publisher, still languishes below a low set in late 2008.Other factors have hurt EA, which was lossmaking for the past three years. The computer game business looks ever more like Hollywood in its search for hits – Call of Duty: Black Ops, made by larger competitor Activision Blizzard, recently set a record with $360m of sales on its first day of release. That means higher development costs and bigger losses if a game turns into a turkey. Also, the hardware cycle leads a similar cycle of buying habits for games; software sales for the ageing Nintendo Wii and the DS and PSP hand-held systems have fallen.Still, restructuring has tamed EA’s costs and it is set to be profitable again this year. Lurking within is a sizeable and rapidly growing business in games downloaded digitally, which now contributes a fifth of its sales. The company is the largest maker of games for mobile devices, leaving it well placed as smartphone sales rocket upwards. A Star Wars-themed massive multiplayer online (MMO) game set for release next year should also attract a sizeable chunk of the 12m or so MMO subscribers online.All that is available at a multiple of 18 times next year’s earnings, relatively cheap compared to the multibillion-dollar valuations bandied about for Zynga, publisher of FarmVille.

126;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-12-06T01:41:47Z;Merseyside emerges as hub for start-ups;;What do Helsinki, Silicon Valley and Liverpool have in common? The answer is a cluster of innovative, digital businesses looking for investment and opportunities to grow.Though the city on the Mersey could seem the odd one out, it is rapidly becoming the first port of call for high-growth start-ups from Finland and the US.HammerKit, a Helsinki company whose software enables novices to design websites, is setting up its first international office in Liverpool.Mark Sorsa-Leslie, its chief executive, said the move was inspired by its backer, the Finnish state venture capital company Veraventure. It had links with the city through Liverpool Vision, the inward investment agency, and suggested he take a look.Mr Sorsa-Leslie, a Scot, said that there were three reasons for choosing Liverpool, which he expects to be the company’s European hub, including the vast BBC-led MediaCity development 30 miles away in Salford, opening in 2011.“The first thing was a well-networked creative and media industry. The second was MediaCity. It is stunning and it is undoubtedly going to have a halo effect for all of us. It is the media equivalent of Docklands and I wanted my company to be close to that. Third, we were made to feel wanted,” he said.The company will employ about 10 people and receive three months’ free rent at the Liverpool Science Park, where there is a cluster of such businesses.While just five years old and still smallish, with €700,000 (£594,000, $936,000) annual turnover and 1,000 customers, Mr Sorsa-Leslie said: “We have to break out of Finland very early. It is a market of 5m people. We have built a system that lets you create your own website 100 per cent through your browser. We have done for web design what desktop publishing did for the print industry.”As for choosing Liverpool over Greater Manchester, he said: “I do not see the distinction.”Steve Smith, ICT director at Liverpool Vision, says many would follow in HammerKit’s wake. He has spent four years cultivating Finnish investors and companies. The Software City convention, bringing together start-ups and investors, has become a key event in the sector.Last month 10 business bosses pitched ideas to investors including Mikko-Jussi Suonenlahti of Veraventure after heats in Silicon Valley and Finland.They included Paava Backman, of Steam Republic – software designers that bring musicians, including Dizzee Rascal, and their fans closer together and increase revenues – and Elina Arponen of Tribe Studios, which has created online multiplayer games that people can complete in one evening.Lou Hong, of GameAttain, a Silicon Valley start-up, said: “The best way to launch our internationalisation strategy is to enter the UK. England and the north-west are of particular interest because of its geography and the high concentration of gaming-related developers and content publishers. It is perhaps, strategically speaking, the best way to gain entry into the EU and to grow our user base.”Taneli Tikka, a serial entrepreneur involved in many start-ups around London’s Old Street, dubbed the “silicon roundabout”, has also been lured north.Mr Tikka, an investor in the likes of Dopplr, which tracks users’ travel, and Muxlim, a social media site for Muslims, said: “Liverpool is emerging as another hub for these kinds of businesses.”However, success is not guaranteed. Bizarre Creations, the studio behind the popular Project Gotham Racing games for the Xbox, has been put up for sale by its owner after disappointing sales of its last two games.Activision of the US said in November that it was “exploring options regarding the future of the business” and its 200 staff feared redundancy.After two years of development Blur, its new racing game, shifted just 500,000 units, compared with 6m for Gotham. James Bond 007: Blood Stone also received mixed reviews.However, there is reported interest in buying a studio that has had a string of hits, with Microsoft, the Xbox’s owner, tipped. It has refused to comment on speculation.Nevertheless, with Sony, which tests all its European games in Liverpool, committing to the city for the long term, the sector as a whole is well placed for the future.
127;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-11-19T13:30:28Z;Vivendi sees continued success for COD franchise;;Activision’s developers can continue to replicate the success of the Call of Duty franchise, said the chief of parent Vivendi, as its latest Black Ops game broke another sales record.Jean-Bernard Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Vivendi, told investors and analysts at the Morgan Stanley TMT conference in Barcelona that Activision, the US publisher in which it holds a majority stake, had overhauled its development studios to ensure the future success of Call of Duty games.The claims come as Activision reported Black Ops generated $650m in global sales during its first five days since its release last week. That tops the $550m from the previous game in the COD series, Modern Warfare 2.“We have broken our own record. I am very, very pleased,” said Mr Lévy.More than 2.6m people have played the shooter, according to Activision, logging millions of online multiplayer sessions – a key part of the game’s appeal.“Call of Duty has become the first entertainment property in history to set five-day launch records for two consecutive years across all forms of entertainment,” said Robert Kotick, Activision Blizzard’s chief executive. “The title’s success illustrates the mass appeal of interactive entertainment as millions of consumers are choosing to play Call of Duty: Black Ops at unprecedented levels rather than engage in other forms of media. The number of people playing online and the number of hours they are playing demonstrates how online gaming has become a mainstream form of entertainment and certainly validates Activision Blizzard’s leadership role in online entertainment.”Several video game franchises have sold in high quantities through several releases over many years, often outlasting movie brands. For example, Nintendo recently marked 25 years since its first Super Mario game and the latest titles for its Wii and DS consoles continue to sell well, while Electronic Arts has revived its Fifa soccer franchise after a blip a few years ago.But some analysts have questioned how many times Activision can repeat its success with COD, especially in the wake of key staff departures at Infinity Ward, the studio that developed Modern Warfare 2.Mr Lévy said that Activision had “got over” the problems at Infinity Ward, leaving the prospects for the quality of future games looking secure.“The Treyarch studio, which made this year’s game, has done better than what Infinity Ward could achieve a year ago,” Mr Lévy said.“We have reconstructed Infinity Ward, we are very happy with the way we have been able to reconstruct it.”He added: “We also have a third studio, which was created a year and a half ago, called Sledgehammer, which is working on Call of Duty properties. We believe this set-up of studios. . . has demonstrated it can do very well, for sure.”The eighth game in the series is slated for release towards the end of 2011, although few details of the title have yet been released.
128;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Universal to launch US cost cutting drive;;Universal Music Group, which is owned by Vivendi of France, is to launch a cost-cutting drive within its US business to try to curb a slide in profitability from plunging sales of compact discs.The world’s largest record music company posted earnings before interest tax and amortisation of €244m (£206m) in the first nine months of 2010, down by 9.3 per cent on the same period last year, or down 14.7 per cent taking out exchange rate effects. Sales fell by 1.7 per cent.The fall in earnings was easily offset by better than expected profits at Vivendi’s GVT Brazilian telecoms unit and at Activision Blizzard, its games business. Vivendi recorded EBITA up 10 per cent and sales rose by 6.9 per cent, ahead of analysts’ estimates.The French entertainment group raised its earnings guidance for games and GVT for the third time this year, helped by booming sales of its recently-released Call of Duty: Black Ops game, and faster growth in sales of broadband internet in Brazil.Philippe Capron, Vivendi’s chief financial officer, said Lucian Grainge, the co-head of UMG who takes full charge next year, was working on a cost-cutting plan for UMG’s US business.There was “very, very significant potential” for cost savings. “A lot of fat can be taken out without hurting muscle and bones,” Mr Capron said.UMG saw a better third-quarter after a “relatively soft” first half, Mr Capron added, with recent releases and growth in music publishing and merchandising helping to offset the continuing decline of CDs.Physical music sales fell by 13.7 per cent over the first nine months of the year whereas digital sales have risen by only 3.1 per cent, held back by a shrinking market for ringtones. Mr Capron said the ringtone sales had now shrunk to such an extent that they were no longer a drag on UMG’s overall digital revenues, which surged by 18.5 per cent in the third quarter.In spite of the fall in sales and earnings, Mr Capron said UMG should be able to meet its objective of a margin of at least 10 per cent “without too much difficulty”.Vivendi insists that it is committed to UMG, which still has good profit margins and generates a lot of cash.Vivendi is still hoping to buy the 44 per cent share in SFR, its French telecoms business, owned by Vodafone. But Mr Capron said there was “no ongoing negotiation” between Vivendi and the UK telecoms operator. “So far we have not seen any specific signal for accelerating this discussion,” he added.
129;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-11-11T19:36:53Z;‘Black Ops’ launch takes $360m in a day;;"Activision Blizzard has set a record for a video game launch, saying that its Call of Duty: Black Ops title made $360m in North America and the UK alone in the 24 hours after it went on sale this week.The figure, exceeding the previous US and UK record of $310m set by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, confirms games’ ability to generate bigger initial sales than Hollywood films, even if movie blockbusters still sell more over time. Avatar, James Cameron’s 3D epic, took $242m worldwide in its opening weekend.Black Ops should generate more than $1bn in retail sales over the holiday period, said Colin Sebastian, analyst at Lazard Capital Markets, noting that this would rival sales of past entertainment bestsellers from Titanic to Michael Jackson’s Thriller album.“This is a blockbuster – the Lord of the Rings of games,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, games analyst at the Screen Digest research group.The Vivendi-controlled games publisher made the announcement at the same time as a rival media group signalled plans to exit video games.Viacom, which bought Harmonix for $175m four years ago, said it was in talks to sell the developer behind the Rock Band music games brand.“The console games business requires an expertise and scale that we don’t have,” said Philippe Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, adding that it was in discussions with “several potential buyers”.Analysts questioned whether existing games publishers would want Harmonix, citing the steep decline in music-themed games such as Rock Band and Activision’s rival Guitar Hero franchise, but said another media group, toy company or maker of games accessories could try to reposition it.Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley estimated that Rock Band would lose about $11m in 2011. Michael Pachter of Wedbush Morgan Securities said the music genre was “saturated”, and forecast that annual sales would level off at about $300m, down from a peak of $1.7bn in 2008.“The genre had a couple of really hot years where the casual gamer came in but then did not really
stay around,” added Doug Creutz of Cowen and
Company.Media groups including Walt Disney and Time Warner’s Warner Bros studio have been buying games developers, and Hasbro, the toy company, already markets video games through Electronic Arts.Viacom’s announcement came as it unveiled better than expected earnings for the three months to September 30, driven by MTV hits such as Jersey Shore. Mr Dauman signalled plans to step up international sales and profits, saying that digital distribution gave it an opportunity to enter countries that were once closed to western media companies."
130;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
131;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-11-11T18:44:52Z;Let the video games begin;Both the Kinect and Move consoles are expected to be Christmas hits;Casual gamers, as the category name suggests, are a fickle bunch. Just ask the maker of the Wii or the publisher of Guitar Hero.Nintendo expects sales of software for its motion-controlled console to fall by more than 25 per cent in its current fiscal year, while sales in the music genre led by Activision Blizzard’s Guitar Hero fell 50 per cent in 2009 and continued their slump this year.But both companies made large profits in the good years before the interest of casual gamers faded, with people of all ages picking up Wiimotes and guitar-shaped controllers to try out the latest crazes.Which brings us to Microsoft and Sony’s attempts to replicate the Wii’s success and breathe new life into their consoles with the launch of, respectively, the Kinect and Move motion-controlling accessories this holiday season.Kinect went on sale in the US last week for $150 or in a $300 bundle with an Xbox 360 4Gb console, and in Europe on Wednesday (£129 and £250 in the UK, €149 and €250 elsewhere). Sony’s Move package of a camera, wand controller and game debuted in September at $100 (£60 in the UK, €60 elsewhere in Europe).Both are expected to be a Christmas hit in the US and Europe, with total sales of 5m for Kinect forecast by Microsoft. Sony also expects to be close to that figure with Move if it can cope with demand. But should either be on your Christmas shopping lists and will they expand the market enough, beyond the staple of hard-core gamers, by standing the test of time with casual ones?More a casual than a hard-core player, I have been testing both side-by-side, playing similar games, and finding that each has its own appeal and frustrations.Both have motion-sensing cameras that sit above or below the TV screen, but the Kinect is three times larger than Sony’s Eye camera and is more sophisticated.The Kinect device contains an infra-red depth sensor that allows it to see your living room in 3D, along with a regular camera that enables facial recognition, takes photos of players in silly poses as they contort themselves during play and enables video-conferencing. Four microphones pinpoint voices, extract ambient noise and allow voice commands.A motor inside adjusts the camera to the different heights of players and the living room space. While the camera engages a wide-angle view of the room for video calls, the actual playing space is more confined and some games that incorporate a player’s image or silhouette outline a box on the screen in which they must remain for movements to be picked up accurately. I found this a little ironic – Microsoft staged an extravagant Cirque du Soleil show when it unveiled the Kinect name in June, with the theme that the age-old man versus machine battle had finally been won as we were able to control machines with just our gestures.In fact, the machines are controlling us – a Star Trek-style tractor beam is being projected from the television, reaching out into the living room, and gamers must stand within it to respond to the console’s commands.This is especially true in the long set-up processes as the room is calibrated, players are drilled and recognised, logins for Kinect, the Xbox and Xbox Live are established and seemingly endless downloads of updates to games and services take place.In contrast, the games themselves are an exhilarating release once they are finally under way.Pretending I had a steering wheel in my hand, I was guiding my car round a racetrack on screen in Kinect Joy Ride, without having to worry about controls for gears, brakes or accelerator. In Kinect Sports, I was kicking and saving balls in football, and volleying them in table tennis with just sweeping gestures of my arms and legs. Another player can jump in and be recognised while a game is in progress, such as leaping into a white-water rafting experience.We also had fun as a family with Dance Central, making our avatars on screen compete at dance moves to well-known songs. I tried out Your Shape, a fitness workout where I was marked highly for copying the instructor’s movements, but the depth sensor failed to spot my bad posture and body positioning – as my wife, a personal trainer, pointed out.The games were fresher, graphically superior and easier to play than on the Wii, but the challenge for Microsoft will be to keep improving them and maintain casual-gamer interest.In addition to the games, I was just as interested in trying out the Kinect interface, where moving a virtual hand over an option on screen chooses it and different menus can be negotiated with a swiping movement.I had imagined sitting on the couch waving my way languidly through carousels of movies to choose from and asking Kinect to play a favourite song in the Zune or Last.fm services.In practice, the voice commands are still rudimentary, and I had to get up and stand in the correct zone to swat inelegantly at the menu options.Sony’s Eye camera is also rudimentary next to the Kinect – the picture is much grainier and the field of view narrower. But Move is more accurate than Kinect thanks to its use of an additional wand controller with a coloured bulb on the end, whose light allows movement to be pinpointed by the camera.I fed and stroked a cute Eyepet I hatched from an egg on my living room carpet as Move transposed the animal on to the living room scene captured by the camera. This was similar to Kinectimals on the Kinect, where pets can be stroked and played with while remaining in their own world.Playing a Sports Champions game of table tennis, I was impressed by how much more realistic an experience this was with the Move controller than with Kinect’s version. I could easily put spin on the ball and direct it where I wanted it compared to the pure thrashing technique of the dumbed-down Kinect.This kind of precision, where skill is recognised but ease of use still preserved, could see Move appealing to hard-core as well as casual gamers and giving it more longevity. However, Kinect’s gesture and voice-based interactions give it wider uses as consoles become centres for music, movie and TV entertainment as well as games.

132;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-11-08T02:07:32Z;‘Call of Duty’ aims to capture digital sales;;Call of Duty: Black Ops from Activision Blizzard, which launches on Tuesday, is expected to crush formidable opposition and become the biggest selling action video game of the year.The game, made by developer Treyarch, is expected to sell 13m-15m units this quarter, slightly less than its Modern Warfare predecessor made by the Infinity Ward studio. But this will only be the start of a campaign to fulfil the game’s earnings potential.Its predecessor, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, remained the top game in the following three quarters after its release a year ago, helped by significant digital sales of add-on map packs that extended the battlefield and the franchise.Digital revenues are a bright spot for an industry that has seen an 8 per cent decline of its traditional “packaged goods” disc-based business so far this year, according to the NPD research firm.Retail sales have become a double-edged sword for publishers – the game discs that are sold are often traded back once played by consumers and exchanged at the stores for other used games, denying publishers further revenues.Digital extensions of games cannot be traded and neither can mini-games sold online through stores such as Xbox Live Arcade. Publishers are also selling virtual goods and pursuing subscription models for games that can be played online.“Digital is really starting to have an impact this year – the publishers have started to figure out what’s working and what’s not working,” says Doug Creutz, video game analyst at Cowen and Company.“[Video game publishers’] stocks are trading as cheaply as they ever have been, but I think there’s the potential for their economics to improve as revenue shifts more to digital, which tends to reduce the problem of used games sales.”Last week, Activision reported 15 per cent growth in digital sales in the first nine months over 2009, while Electronic Arts, creator of the Medal of Honor game, reported 35 per cent growth over its past two quarters compared to the year before.This came from growth in social gaming, iPad and iPhone game sales and downloadable content related to its packaged goods, where such sales were up 200 per cent.NPD, the official source for industry figures, has tended to ignore these sales in the past as it has charted declines in hardware and software sales over the past two years. One telling statistic though is that its accessories category is no longer dominated by sales of controllers.For every month since March, the Xbox Live 1600-point card – used to buy virtual goods and digital games from the console’s marketplace – has been the top-selling accessory.Xbox Live membership allows players to fight one another in online multiplayer extensions of the console’s titles, where gameplay is free on standard battlefields.Michael Pachter, video game industry analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, says the billions of hours of free play taking place there, by gamers choosing not to go on to buy the extra map packs, is a “high-class problem” for the publishers.“This kind of gaming is becoming so addictive that when the publishers choose to monetise it they will have a willing audience, so it’s a great thing,” he says.NPD is now responding to industry pressure and looking at the bigger picture.It reported last month that while US consumers spent $3.7bn on new physical video and PC game software in the first half of this year, another $2.6bn to $2.9bn was spent in other areas.These were used games, game rentals, subscriptions, digital downloads of full games, social-networking games, downloadable content and mobile game apps.This holiday season, publishers are turning back to the traditional hard-core gamers and their staple first-person shooters. While social gaming on sites such as Facebook and mobile gaming on Apple devices are big growth areas, Doug Creutz says they serve a different audience.“The console gaming experience can’t be replicated on Facebook or the iPad, where there is a different type of consumer, who maybe got interested in the Wii and Guitar Hero and has moved on, but it’s a consumer the publishers were not really counting on in the first place.”
133;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-11-05T00:56:47Z;Activision boosted by online revenues;;Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, has reported third-quarter sales and profits well ahead of forecasts, as digital sales compensate for the industry’s poor performance at retail.Disc-based “packaged goods” sales of console games are down 8 per cent in the US in the first nine months of this year, according to the NPD research firm, but online revenues are booming.“Around 50 per cent of our revenues year-to-date are coming from digital sources,” said Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.The publisher reported revenues of $857m and earnings per share of 12 cents against Wall Street expectations of $747m and 9 cents, respectively.On Tuesday it will release what is expected to be the biggest industry blockbuster of the year, Call of Duty: Black Ops, but it was cautious in raising its full-year guidance to $4.45bn in revenues and earnings of 74 cents per share.Activision has become less dependent on console-based sales since its merger with Blizzard, maker of the World of Warcraft online role-playing PC game that has more than 12m subscribers worldwide.It also benefits from downloadable content sales on the consoles that follow on from disc sales – such as new map packs that extend the playing field of its Call of Duty game.Electronic Arts, the second-largest third-party publisher, surprised the market this week with quarterly figures also boosted by such digital sales.While Activision reported 15 per cent growth in the first nine months compared with 2009, EA reported 35 per cent growth in digital sales over its past two quarters.This came from growth in social gaming, iPad and iPhone game sales and downloaded content related to packaged goods, where sales were up 200 per cent.US consumers spent $3.7bn in the first half of 2010 on physical console and PC software, according to NPD, but $2.6bn-$2.9bn was spent in other ways on games, largely digital.The industry hopes for a boost from motion controllers, with Microsoft releasing its Kinect controller on Thursday and raising its sales forecast to 5m units this quarter, up from 3m.
134;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-09-01T17:13:52Z;Buoyant Vivendi raises full-year targets;;Vivendi, Europe’s largest entertainment group, raised its annual profit targets after revealing better-than-expected earnings that were lifted by its recently acquired Brazilian and French broadband operations and its fast-growing video games business.The French company posted sales of €13.98bn ($17.91bn), up 6.1 per cent on the same period in 2009, and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of €3.24bn, up 11.9 per cent on a like-for-like basis.Vivendi raised its full-year objectives, predicting higher net profit than the €2.59bn achieved in 2009.Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive, argued that the company’s “return to growth” was a vindication of his acquisitions strategy. He singled out last year’s purchase of GVT, the Brazilian broadband provider, for $4.2bn, a price at the upper end of analysts’ valuations.GVT reported a 39 per cent increase in first-half sales and a 49 per cent increase in adjusted ebitda as it accelerated its roll-out of high-speed internet services across Brazil.Vivendi said that it planned to step up its investments in extending GVT’s network to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. GVT also intends to launch a pay-TV product, making use of Vivendi’s expertise with Canal Plus, its French broadcaster.Some analysts raised concerns at the purchase of GVT last year, pointing to its small scale alongside powerful competitors in the Brazilian market, including Spain’s Telefónica. But Mr Lévy described the acquisition as “the most important strategic decision we have taken in the last few years”.The group’s performance was also boosted by strong broadband sales at SFR following the 2008 purchase of fixed-line operator Neuf Cegetel. The French telecoms business, in which it has a 56 per cent stake, posted a 6.6 per cent rise in operating profit.Vivendi was also buoyed by its video games business, a world-leader by sales following the purchase of Activision in 2007, which saw first-half revenues of €1.7bn.Vivendi’s more recently acquired businesses helped offset declining or slowing sales growth at its more traditional operations, including Universal Music Group and SFR’s mobile operations.Investor concerns about Vivendi’s acquisitions strategy and potential damages stemming from a class-action lawsuit in the US have weighed on its share price this year.Vivendi is set to receive a downpayment of $2bn from the proposed sale of its 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal before the US broadcaster’s merger with rival Comcast. Mr Lévy said that he thought the NBC deal could be completed by the end of the year, which would bring Vivendi a further $3.8bn.As for potential acquisitions, Mr Lévy said that Vivendi’s priorities were to buy the 44 per cent stake in SFR owned by Vodafone and the 20 per cent stake in Canal Plus France owned by Lagardère.Lagardère said that it would float its Canal Plus stake after failing to agree a price with Vivendi.Vivendi’s adjusted net profit rose 4 per cent to €1.53bn. Its shares closed nearly 5 per cent up at €19.26.
135;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-08-17T19:22:52Z;Square Enix chief forecasts shift for games;;The head of Square Enix, the Japanese company behind hit games such as Final Fantasy and Tomb Raider, has predicted most games will be played online within the next five years.He also thinks valuations in the social games sector have become over-inflated.Speaking to the Financial Times ahead of GamesCom, Europe’s largest video gaming event, Yoichi Wada, president of Square Enix, predicted turmoil in the industry in the coming years as publishers and developers balance developing new online revenue models with their existing businesses of selling packaged discs.“Going forward, we think that online gaming is going to play a very important role …in 10 years’ time everything will be online and in five years’ time I think most of it will be,” Mr Wada said. “Because things do not progress in linear [fashion], it is difficult to foresee in the mid-term.”Last year, Square Enix acquired Eidos, the company behind Lara Croft, as part of a wider attempt to globalise the business. An online Lara Croft title was released this week, while Final Fantasy XIV will be available later this year as a massively multiplayer online game, competing with the likes of Activision Blizzard’s World of Warcraft.Many online games are offered for free, with players paying for extra levels or special items. Additional content can be sold to update traditional packaged games for consoles such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.As well as expanding existing franchises online, Square Enix will look to develop new titles specifically for the web. Although no single online game has yet generated significant revenues for Square Enix, taken as a group, its digital-only titles will become more significant financially over the next year, he said.But he indicated it was unlikely Square will follow in the footsteps of Electronic Arts and Disney, which have recently paid huge sums for social gaming companies.Last November, EA acquired Playfish, best known for its Facebook game Pet Society, for up to $400m, including performance-related compensation. Last month, Disney paid up to $763.2m for Playdom, including earn-outs, in the same week it sold Miramax, the Pulp Fiction studio, for $660m.“Some of those social gaming companies have been acquired, but the move was too late, meaning the valuation was too expensive,” Mr Wada said. “The key question here is what they have bought by acquiring those companies? Have they been acquired for the sake of the customers, or have they acquired for the sake of the competence in creating or operating games? It is not very clear.”Mr Wada said it would be cheaper to headhunt new talent in this field, rather than buying young companies outright.
136;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-08-06T20:38:33Z;Financials and energy lead US retreat;;"US stocks fell on Friday after data showed that the number of people in work fell more than expected and weak private sector hiring raised doubts about the strength of the economic recovery.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,121.64, after sinking 1.7 per cent to its intraday low, and is up 1.8 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to close at 10,653.56, gaining 1.6 per cent over the week; and the Nasdaq was 0.2 per cent lower closing at 2,288.47, higher by 1.4 per cent for the five days.The US economy shed 131,000 jobs in July after the number of temporary census jobs dropped by 143,000. Analysts had forecast a fall in overall employment of 65,000. Private sector employment rose by 71,000, compared with projections of 90,000. The US unemployment rate remained steady at 9.5 per cent.Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments, said he thought the most the market could hope for was a stabilisation of jobs figures towards the end of the year.He added that he was concerned about revisions to the previous month’s figures. In June an overall fall of 125,000 was reported but that has now been revised to a drop of 221,000. He said this not only meant the unemployment picture was worse than previously thought, it also led him to question the reliability of July’s figures.Seven of the 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell in a broad-based sell-off. The energy, consumer discretionary and financials segments suffered as fears grew over the pace of the global recovery.The financial sector slid 0.8 per cent. JPMorgan slid 2 per cent to $40.44, Bank of America lost 0.4 per cent to $13.96 and Citigroup fell 1 per cent to $4.06.The energy sector was down 1.2 per cent and the consumer discretionary index was lower by 0.5 per cent. But shares in gold miners rose after the economic concerns prompted a rise in the price of gold. Barrick Gold was up 1.5 per cent to $43.39.Kraft Foods climbed 2.4 per cent to $30.36 after reporting better-than-
expected earnings for the quarter and raising its target for cost savings from the acquisition of Cadbury.The world’s second-largest food company announced earnings per share of 60 cents compared with an average forecast of 52 cents per share.American International Group rose 2.6 per cent to $40.93 after the insurer reported a second-quarter net loss of $3.96 a share, compared with a net profit of $2.30 for the same period a year earlier due to a goodwill impairment charge.After adjusting for the charge, the bailed out group beat expectations. It also said it had started talks on separation from the US government.Among the fallers, EOG Resources, a natural gas company, dropped 3.1 per cent to $99.26 after second-quarter profits missed analysts’ estimates. Net income was 24 cents a share, compared with a net loss of 7 cents for the same period a year earlier.Shares of ATP Oil & Gas Corporation also fell after it reported worse-than-expected earnings. The Gulf of Mexico producer tumbled 16.4 per cent to $11.08 after it announced a second-quarter loss of $82.9m, compared with a loss of $4.4m for the same period a year earlier.Video game publisher Activision Blizzard dropped 6.5 per cent to $11 after it forecast third-quarter profit and revenue below average analyst projections.In deal news, Google dropped 1.6 per cent to $500.22 after it bought Slide, the social gaming company, as part of its attempts to increase its presence in social networking. It was reported that the search engine owner paid $182m.Apple fell 0.6 per cent to $260.09 after reports that it is in talks to buy Chinese software maker Handseeing, which would be Apple’s first acquisition in the country."
137;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-07-04T16:00:53Z;Activision stays ahead of game market;;Activision claimed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was the biggest entertainment launch to date when it was released last November. And eight months later, gamers are still avidly gunning down Russian terrorists and Afghan insurgents.You might expect the boss of the company behind the world’s most popular video game to be happy. But when it comes to Call of Duty, Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, feels he is missing out.A big part of the game’s appeal is its online multiplayer mode, which allows people to shoot at their friends from the comfort of their own sofas. Internet gaming is almost too popular, with some analysts blaming the 1.7bn hours of online play on Call of Duty between November and April for sluggish sales of newer titles.While console makers – particularly Microsoft with Xbox Live – receive regular subscription payments for online activity, games publishers such as Activision and Electronic Arts see little ongoing benefit beyond selling the original disc.“We’ve heard that 60 per cent of [Microsoft’s] subscribers are principally on Live because of Call of Duty,” says Mr Kotick. “We don’t really participate financially in that income stream. We would really like to be able to provide much more value to those millions of players playing on Live, but it’s not our network.”Downloads of maps and add-ons for Call of Duty have sold well. But missing the larger opportunity is surprising as Activision Blizzard pioneered multiplayer online gaming with its World of Warcraftfranchise.Warcraft, which is played on PC rather than PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 consoles, charges a subscription and is backed by a vast technical and customer-support infrastructure, which could easily be redirected to the Call of Duty world.Online subscriptions are important in the Chinese market, where mass piracy undermines disc sales.Mr Kotick sees an opportunity to break the consoles’ “walled gardens with new gamer-friendly PCs, designed to be plugged into the television. PCs have long been used for online play, but PC gaming remains niche when the games industry needs to widen its appeal.“We have always been platform agnostic,” says Mr Kotick. “[Consoles] do a very good job of supporting the gamer. If we are going to broaden our audiences, we are going to need to have other devices.”Activision will “very aggressively” support efforts by Dell and HP to connect PCs to TVs.Mr Kotick is excited by Microsoft’s motion-sensing controller. Xbox Kinect dispenses with the hand-held joystick in favour of a camera and microphone. He hopes Kinect will help revive the peripherals market along the lines of Activision’s Guitar Hero and DJ Hero. Mr Kotick remains bullish on “physical interfaces” in spite of February’s $409m writedown for its Guitar Hero business.Voice-controlled gaming holds the potential for attracting new kinds of players, he adds. “You’re going to see a tremendous amount of innovation in audio. Voice recognition is something people haven’t really thought about from a user interface perspective.”Modern video gaming warfare, it seems, includes short-term alliances and longer-term conflicts.
138;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Games publishers rethink UK investment;;Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video games publisher, said the government’s decision to scrap a plannedtax relief for the games sector could threaten the company’s plans to invest in the UK.“For us to continue to invest in the UK there needs to be an incentive provided for us to do so,” said Robert Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard.“The talent pool in the UK is among the best in the world for what we do. But we really need to see some more incentives. We are seeing great incentives in Canada, Singapore and eastern bloc countries,” he said.The group employs 700 people in the UK and owns studios in Liverpool and Leamington Spa, which have produced titles such as Blur, a racing game, and DJ Hero, follow up to Activision’s successful Guitar Hero franchise. This week the company joined Tiga, the UK trade body for games developers, which has been lobbying for the tax breaks for more than five years.Executives at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which has more than 1,200 games developers and three large development studios in the UK, also said withdrawal of the promised tax relief could affect their plans.“The existing plans will continue but any further new developments would have to be looked at. Maybe something that was planned for the UK would go abroad now,” said Ray Maguire, Sony Computer Entertainment’s UK managing director.Mr Maguire said that many countries, such as Malta, were considering capitalising on the UK’s indecision and rolling out their own tax incentives to lure games companies.In Canada, games companies can get around 30 to 40 per cent tax relief on items such as wages. France recently introduced a 20 per cent tax relief scheme for the industry, which has resulted in Ubisoft, the French games publisher, increasing investment in the country.Meanwhile, the UK has slipped from 3rd to 5th place as the biggest global computer games developer. According to Tiga, 44 video game businesses, or 15 per cent of the UK total, closed between July 2008 and July 2009, at a loss of about 1,000 jobs.Philip Oliver, chief executive and co-founder of Blitz Games, a Leamington Spa-based games development company, said the tax relief scheme would have helped change the perception of the UK as an expensive place to develop games.“They got into the the habit of saying we were too expensive when the exchange rates were high and that attitude still persists today. If the UK government was seen as helping the UK games industry it would have been helpful to perception.”Tom Watson, a Labour MP who has backed the games industry’s campaign, said that before the election, both Liberal Democrat and Tory shadow ministers had said that they would support a tax break.“The industry made a very powerful argument,” he said. “The government have got to do a bit more to explain why they had to [cut] it.”He said that Labour MPs would seek to amend the finance bill to reinstate the tax break, if only to force the government to more fully explain its reasons for the change.But he said he was “very pessimistic” about the prospects for a reversal, especially given opposition from Vince Cable, business secretary, to central support for industry.“Find me alternative jobs for highly qualified games developers in Warwickshire [where Activision has studios].”
139;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-05-07T02:43:58Z;Activision expects new game to be bestseller;;The head of Activision Blizzard said on Thursday that a revolt at the studio responsible for the record-breaking Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 would not adversely affect the world’s biggest video game publisher.Bobby Kotick, chief executive, also forecast that the next instalment of the Call of Duty franchise – Black Ops – would outsell Halo: Reach when the two blockbuster action games are released in the autumn, and would become the biggest video game of the year.Activision released first-quarter figures well ahead of analysts’ expectations and its own guidance.The south California-based company reported revenues of $714m, for earnings per share of 9 cents, against its forecast in February for $525m sales and profits of 2 cents a share.In mid-April it said it was tracking ahead of its outlook, leading to analyst expectations of sales of $563m and earnings per share of 4 cents.Activision said its better-than-expected performance was due to “strong global consumer demand” for Call of Duty and Blizzard Entertainment’s World of Warcraft online game.Activision shares have fallen 12 per cent in the past month over concerns about the defection of the creators of Modern Warfare 2, which has generated more than $1.5bn in revenues. About a quarter of the staff at its Infinity Ward studio have left following the firing of its studio heads two months ago.The company has alleged in a lawsuit that Vincent Zampella and Jason West were trying to “steal the studio” and had secretly met top executives of its rival Electronic Arts. Since their dismissal, the two have launched a studio called Respawn and announced the backing of EA for a new game in the action genre.The former executives are suing Activision for damages and unpaid royalties, while 38 Infinity Ward employees are also suing the company for allegedly delaying and withholding more than $54m in royalties for Modern Warfare 2. They claim they are being “held hostage” by the publisher.Mr Kotick said the company had no choice but to sack the executives for insubordination and breach of contract, but the franchise would not be affected.“It’s a magnet for talent, we have a lot of other [studio] resources, we don’t think we will see a blip,” he said.Activision has alternated development of Call of Duty games with its Treyarch studio, developer of this year’s Black Ops.“I’m comfortable Call of Duty: Black Ops will be the biggest video game of the year,” he added. The title is available on multiple platforms, while Halo: Reach is exclusive to Microsoft’s Xbox 360 console.
140;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-05-02T16:14:13Z;Real-world battle clouds game publishers’ successes;;Video gamers will get their first chance on Monday to engage one another in Halo: Reach – the year’s most anticipated title – while an acrimonious real-world battle rages over the action genre.The latest Halo game becomes available in an online multiplayer beta version, ahead of its full release in the autumn, and just four days after its developer Bungie announ-ced a 10-year alliance with the leading publisher Activision Blizzard.The deal was good news for Activision which has suffered the bad publicity in recent weeks of an uprising at its Infinity Ward studio, home of last year’s best-selling game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.The developments illustrate how the action genre and hard-core gamers still dominate the industry, despite the growth of more casual gaming and the success of the Nintendo Wii.The record revenues generated by the Halo, Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty franchises have created rich rewards in royalties for the developers. But they have also generated tensions in relationships with their publishers. The heads of Infinity Ward – Vincent Zampella and Jason West – were fired by Activision in March for alleged insubordination and breach of contract. They have since said they will set up their own studio – Respawn Entertainment – and a distribution deal with Activision’s arch-rival, Electronic Arts.The Infinity Ward executives denied the allegations and are suing Activision for damages and unpaid royalties of more than $36m.In a countersuit, Activision alleged Mr West and Mr Zampella had schemed to “steal the studio” and made a secret trip to meet senior EA executives.Last week, 38 Infinity Ward employees also sued Activision for allegedly delaying and withholding more than $54m in royalties for Modern Warfare 2. They claimed they were being “held hostage” by the publisher and analysts interpreted the move as a tactic by Activision to prevent them defecting to Respawn.Modern Warfare 2 surpassed Grand Theft Auto IV and Halo 3 as the most successful entertainment launch of all time when it was released last November. It recorded $402m in sales on its first day, according to Guinness World Records, and has generated revenues of more than $1.5bn for Activision.Halo: Reach is the last title in the franchise to be made by Bungie, which originally developed Halo, was bought by Microsoft in 2000 and then regained its independence in 2007 at the expense of handing over future Halo games to a Microsoft subsidiary.Harold Ryan, head of Bungie, says the studio expects Halo: Reach will be “the greatest game of all time” and he has no qualms about having its next planned action-genre game published by Activision.“This is a great deal that we have been working on for over nine months, the timing is unfortunate with all the other [Infinity Ward] stuff going on,” he says.Bungie’s independent status means Activision will avoid any possible royalty wrangles and defections it has suffered with in-house Infinity Ward. But with Bungie owning the intellectual property, Activision’s earnings potential should be more limited than for the Call of Duty franchise it owns.“This is going to deliver operating-income margins greater than 20 per cent to Activision,” insists Thomas Tippl, Activision chief operating officer.“Activision has tarnished its reputation with the developer community with all these headlines,” says Michael Pachter, Wedbush Morgan video game analyst, but he says the level of press attention is unusual.These kind of moves have always characterised the industry, he points out. To complete a circle, Mr West and Mr Zampella’s creation of Respawn joins them back up with EA, where they worked at another studio making its Medal of Honor games, before breaking away to form Infinity Ward in 2002.
141;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-04-30T18:25:54Z;Lara Croft escapes console in latest adventure;;Gamers looking to play the next version of the Lara Croft computer game will not be lining up at a store when it launches, but logging on to download the title over the internet.The next iteration of the game franchise is to be released as an internet download only, as Square Enix becomes the latest games publisher to tap the growing consumer appetite for playing games online.Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is to be released in the next few months, priced at about £10 ($15) in the UK, and representing a significant revamp of the 13-year franchise.“We wanted to promote new games for new markets. The adventure series for Lara Croft will be more arcade-like, with the camera further away, more action and the ability to play characters other than Lara,” said Phil Rogers, chief executive of Square Enix Europe.It is the first Lara Croft title to be released since Square Enix of Japan took over Eidos a year ago, gaining ownership of one of the UK’s most famous games franchises. Mr Rogers said they were targeting a new audience of casual gamers who want to “snack” on games for a short period, rather than immersing themselves for hours at a time in an expensive console game.A revamp is necessary. The last Lara Croft game, Tomb Raider: Underworld, released in 2008, had lower sales than expected. Crystal Dynamics, the Square Enix studio that developed it was forced to lay off staff and Toby Gard, co-creator of the game, left the company.A number of computer games publishers have been rushing into online games. Electronic Arts is developing online versions of most of its games franchises and last year paid $400m for Playfish, which makes games for online social networks including Facebook.The World of Warcraft online role-playing game – which has more than 11.5m subscribers – accounts for nearly a third of revenues at Activision Blizzard, the world’s biggest games group.Codemasters of the UK, which recently saw Reliance Big Entertainment of India take a 50 per cent stake in the company, said it planned to invest heavily in online games, creating web versions of titles such as its Ashes Cricket game.This year, EA predicted a 3 per cent fall in industry sales of packaged games but 26 per cent growth for digital and online games.“2008 was the peak in terms of sales of boxed products. Although we will see a new generation of games consoles coming out in 2013 or 2014, we wouldn’t expect the new cycle to reach the same highs,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, lead games analyst at Screen Digest. “All games companies need to switch onto online to maintain sales.”Mr Harding-Rolls estimates 38 per cent of western games revenues could come from online sales by 2014.Online gaming could also help companies move into markets such as China, where widespread piracy has often made publishers reluctant to launch boxed games.In spite of the stampede online, it is still unclear how the economics of online games will stack up. They tend to be much cheaper and quicker to produce than console versions.“We were working on it for months rather than years and had a team of 20 people rather than 200,” Mr Rogers said. However, they are priced much lower too.“Online games will reach more people, but the big question will be whether that audience can be monetised to the same extent,” Mr Harding-Rolls said. “The answer is probably no. Online is a very fragmented market with a precedent of a lot of free access. Online gamers will not spend the same amount as a hardcore gamer [would have] in the golden era of packaged console games.”Tellingly, Square Enix is not planning to stop making packaged games any time soon. “We still fully believe in console games and will not give up selling disks,” Mr Rogers said.
142;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-03-05T03:20:26Z;Legal Bullets Fly Over Call of Duty;;Open warfare has broken out between Activision Blizzard and the two studio heads it fired this week  responsible for its biggest hit -Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 .Activision responded on Thursday to a lawsuit filed in a Los Angeles court by lawyers representing Jason West and Vince Zampella, president and chief executive respectively of the Infinity Ward studio, over their dismissal.In the suit, the studio co-founders allege Activision found a pretext to dismiss them in order to avoid paying them substantial royalties in the coming weeks, due to them for the success of Modern Warfare 2.Activision said last month the game had generated more than $1bn in revenues since its launch in November, suggesting millions of dollars was at stake. The LA Times reported that the suit alleged that the world’s biggest publisher owes the two unpaid royalties and damages in excess of $36m.More important, the co-founders are arguing that the court should rule they have creative control over all Modern Warfare games and that Activision may not release any Call of Duty games set after the Vietnam War without their approval.Activision owns the Call of Duty brand but a court decision against it could limit its options for sequels to the game.“We were shocked by Activision’s decision to terminate our contract,” said Mr West in a statement.“We poured our heart and soul into that company, building not only a world class development studio, but assembling a team we’ve been proud to work with for nearly a decade. We think the work we’ve done speaks for itself.”Their lawyer Robert Schwartz said: “Instead of thanking, lauding, or just plain paying Jason and Vince for giving Activision the most successful entertainment product ever offered to the public, last month Activision hired lawyers to conduct a pretextual ‘investigation’ into unstated and unsubstantiated charges of ‘insubordination’ and ‘breach of fiduciary duty,’ which then became the grounds for their termination on Monday, March 1st.”Activision said in its statement it was disappointed that its ex-employees had chosen to file a lawsuit and believed their claims were without merit.“Over eight years, Activision shareholders provided these executives with the capital they needed to start Infinity Ward, as well as the financial support, resources and creative independence that helped them flourish and achieve enormous professional success and personal wealth,” it said.
143;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-03-01T11:28:19Z;Vivendi takes US lawsuit provision;;Vivendi, Europe’s largest entertainment group, has made a €550m ($750m) provision for damages it could incur in a US class-action lawsuit in which former shareholders claim the company issued misleading financial information a decade ago.The French company said the provision might have to be amended because any eventual damages “could differ significantly, in either direction, from the amount of the reserve”.Vivendi said it would continue to contest the “unfounded claims” after being found liable by a New York court this year of misleading investors about the financial and operation strength of the company during a takeover spree between 2000 and 2002.In spite of the provision, Vivendi unveiled better than expected annual results, with underlying net profit up 5.5 per cent at €2.585bn and sales up 6.9 per cent at €27.132bn.Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive, attributed his company’s solid performance among other things to the “phenomenal success” of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, a blockbuster release last year from its Activision Blizzard games unit, which has already notched up $1bn in sales.Mr Lévy forecast further growth in earnings before interest, tax and amortisation in 2010 following its acquisition last year of GVT, a fast-growing Brazilian broadband operator, and its decision to sell its 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal, the US broadcaster and film studio. The NBCU sale, once completed, will release cash for further acquisitions.The strong profit growth in Vivendi’s games business helped to compensate for the continued decline in recorded music sales at Universal Music Group, with demand for CDs continuing to slide. Ebita at UMG fell by 14.7 per cent in 2009.Vivendi was also buoyed by sales growth and stable profits at its SFR and Maroc Telecom units and by Canal Plus, its pay-TV arm, where cost-cutting has helped to boost margins.The French company’s strong operational performance has been overshadowed in recent months by the class action lawsuit, which according to lawyers for the plaintiffs is one of the largest in terms of number of litigants and amount of potential damages.Mr Lévy said the company was being “prudent” in accounting terms by making the provision. ”But the legal case will be long and complex and we have the strong hope that at the end of it all we will have nothing to pay out at all,” he added.The €550m is only a fraction of the $8bn maximum that lawyers for the plaintiffs say the company could eventually face in damages. Vivendi vigorously disputes the larger figure as “unfounded”, saying it is too early to calculate full potential damages in the verdict, which it intends to appeal against.
144;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-02-12T09:01:51Z;Halo:Reach is highlight of Microsoft unveiling;;Microsoft and the Bungie independent studio gave an impressive demonstration of Halo:Reach , the next major instalment of the blockbuster Xbox franchise, at a media event in San Francisco on Thursday evening.The first-person shooter was one of more than a dozen games shown by Microsoftat its X10 event , in a bullish demonstration of its firepower for the year ahead.It was an optimistic end to the week for the industry. Electronic Arts  and Activision Blizzard issued downbeat forecasts  on Monday and Wednesday and figures from the NPD research firm on Thursday showed that software sales fell 12 per cent in January.Reach’s graphics looked on a different planet to those of previous Halos. Reach is a different planet, as it happens, in the Halo story, but there was a much greater level of hi-def detail in both the landscape and in the uniforms and weapons of the soldiers.Reach uses a new rendering engine, making special effects and lighting more realistic and allowing more artificial intelligence in the characters.The game will be released in the autumn, but Microsoft announced a public multiplayer online beta will launch on May 3.“The graphic quality is a huge leap from previous versions. The folks from Bungie are calling this the definitive Halo game, this is kind of the Halo they’ve dreamed of,” Aaron Greenberg, director of product management for Xbox, told me.“Many people are referring to Halo:Reach as the biggest game of the year, period. There’s an emotional connection that people have with Halo that’s really special – like Star Wars is to the movies and Harry Potter is to books, Halo is that to video games.”Microsoft also allowed the media a hands-on with the long-awaited Alan Wake game , now launching on May 18 in the US.Crackdown 2, Fable III  and Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Conviction, all console exclusives, were among other titles being shown at X10.“We think 2010 is going to bethe biggest year in the history of our business , not just because of Halo:Reach, but we’ve also got Project Natal [motion-sensing controllers] launching this holiday,” said Mr Greenberg.“This is our biggest lineup of triple-A blockbuster games as well. We’ve got more exclusive titles that should all be multi-million unit sellers in one year than we’ve ever had before.”Microsoft’s selection of disk-based games, and those being focused on by Activision and EA, shows the industry is concentrating once again on hard-core gamers aftermass-market consumers showed their fickleness in tiring of games such as Guitar Hero and Rock Band last year.Those buyers are unlikely to be persuaded to pay $400 for the Final Fantasy XIII Special Edition Bundle announced by Microsoft and Square Enix on Thursday.“There’s uncertainty with the casual gamer because of the economy, so we’re much more focused on making sure we do everything that we can to satisfy the core gaming enthusiasts,” Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard chief executive, told me on Wednesday.The January NPD figures showed software sales of $598m in the US, down 12 per cent from the $683m recorded in January 2009.The top-selling games were New Super Mario Bros for the Wii, followed by EA’s Mass Effect 2 on the Xbox 360.The console makers all had their spin on hardware sales. The Wii led again with 465,000 units sold. Nintendo said this had been achieved despite inventory shortages.Microsoft said its 333,000 units sold mean it now had sold nearly 8m more current-generation consoles in the US than Sony.Sony said its PlayStation 3 was the only console to see double-digit growth in January – its 277,000 units sold represented a 36 per cent increase on January 2009.UPDATE: Analysts at Wedbush Morgan said in a note on Friday they were surprised at the level of decline in software sales in January:“It seems that monthly software sales declines will never end, with January marking the 10th month of sales declines in the last 11. It was disconcerting that after relatively solid results of -3 per cent and -7 per cent in November and December, January saw a return to double-digit declines, and the magnitude of the decline in the face of a solid software lineup gives us pause.”In the music genre, Wedbush Morgan said Guitar Hero franchise sales were down 67 per cent on the $54m of a year ago and EA’s Rock Band sales were down 65 per cent from $28m. Overall music genre sales were $29m, down from $84m in January 2009.
145;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-02-11T22:03:11Z;Positive corporate results lift Wall Street;;Wall Street bounced back on Thursday after positive corporate results distracted the market from lingering uncertainty over Greece.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1 per cent at 1,078.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 10,144.19 and the Nasdaq rose 1.4 per cent at 2,177.41.US stocks were down for the first two hours of trading after Europe’s rescue plan for Greece failed to satisfy investors, owing to its lack of detail.But encouraging unemployment data and better-than-expected corporate results gave support to the market.The number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits dropped sharply last week.Economists had been expecting about 465,000 new claims but the labour department reported that initial jobless claims had dropped from a revised 483,000 in the previous week to 440,000.PepsiCo doubled its profit in the last quarter thanks to strong international sales but the soft-drink manufacturer’s results were broadly in line with forecasts. Its shares gained 1.3 per cent to $61.19.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, VF Corp rose 2.6 per cent to $74.35 after the apparel group posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit owing to tight inventories. However, the group, which owns brands such as The North Face and Wrangler, warned that the consumer spending climate was still “exceptionally difficult”.AutoNation, the country’s largest car dealership, also beat its quarterly estimates. The group reported its first quarterly increase in revenue from new vehicle sales for five years. However, its shares were down 3 per cent to $17.69.3M rose 2.1 per cent to $80.27 after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded the diversified manufacturer from “market-perform” to “outperform”. They cited better margins and the potential for growth in multi-industrial groups.“These individual stories are able to provide a little bit of support but the issue of Europe continues to hang over the market,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.He added that investors were waiting for greater clarification of the rescue plan, expected next week.Viacom, which owns the MTV Networks and Paramount film studios, posted quarterly profit above consensus estimates thanks to the popularity of movies such as Transformers 2 and Star Trek. Profits rose almost fourfold in spite of declining advertising revenue from its cable channels. But after early strength, the shares were down 0.7 per cent to $30.04.Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, posted better-than-expected results and announced its first dividend.The group’s holiday release, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, has helped it to shrug off lingering concerns in the sector. Activision’s shares jumped 9.6 per cent to $11.07.Tekelec, which provides network equipment, posted better-than-expected quarterly results following strong demand and lower expenses. The company also announced the retirement of its chief financial officer, Bill Everett. Tekelec added 13.5 per cent to $16.89.Boston Scientific, the world’s second-largest maker of heart devices, weighed on the market after giving a disappointing forecast for this year.The group said it would also cut up to 1,300 jobs, or 10 per cent of its non-manufacturing staff. Shares in the company dropped 9.9 per cent to $7.47.Allegheny Energy jumped 12 per cent to $23.55 after FirstEnergy agreed to buy the power company for $4.7bn. The takeover is set to create one of the country’s largest utilities, serving more than 6.1m customers.The acquisition faces both state and federal regulatory hurdles but First-Energy said it expects to close the deal in just over a year’s time. FirstEnergy shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $39.59.Elsewhere in the sector, Hornbeck Offshore Services fell 9.5 per cent to $18.31. The provider of marine transportation to the offshore oil and gas industry gave a disappointing forecast for 2010.
146;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-02-11T14:52:04Z;Film profit drives strong Viacom results;;Viacom’s operating profit in the fourth quarter surged on DVD sales and box office sales of the Paranormal Activity film, but a steep drop in sales of Rock Band, the music video game, and a decline in advertising revenue underscored the fact that a recovery in the US economy has yet to take hold.Sumner Redstone, executive chairman of Viacom, remained optimistic, however, on the economic outlook, citing an acceleration in advertising spending: “There is a steady drumbeat in renewal and progress, particularly in the domestic market”.The owner of the Paramount film studios and MTV Networks reported a fourth quarter net profit of $694m, or $1.14 per share, from $173m, or 28 cents per share a year earlier when it logged a big restructuring charge. Revenue slipped 3 per cent to $4bn.A sharp decline in Rock Band game sales, reflecting an industry-wide tempering of interest in the music game genre, accounted for a 37 per cent fall in ancillary revenue.Activision Blizzard, rival video game maker and producer of the Guitar Hero franchise, was buffeted by poor sales of the game over the same period, which led to a $409m writedown.Global advertising revenue fell 3 per cent and US ad revenue fell 4 per cent.First quarter advertising is expected to improve from the fourth quarter on the heels of better ratings on a slate of new shows including the controversial Jersey Shore, a reality show that follows the exploits of a group of young Italian-Americans that has elicited love-hate opinions from audiences.“As Snooki would say, this is a good situation,” said Philippe Dauman, chief executive of Viacom, tempering his enthusiasm with a “cautiously optimistic” outlook. “We’re not out of the economic woods yet.”Strong DVD sales of Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, Star Trek and GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra helped boost the bottom line. Viacom restructured its films division and pruned its portfolio of movies.Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: “A more prudent and profitable film strategy going forward should help in a sustainable way”.
147;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-02-10T23:55:08Z;Activision rocked by ‘Guitar Hero’ writedown;;Activision Blizzard, the world’s biggest video game publisher, announced a $409m writedown on Tuesday as its Guitar Hero franchise hit a sour note with consumers.Its move followed Electronic Arts’ disclosure on Monday that it had no current plans to distribute another title in its rival Rock Band series of games.The music genre, once a big growth driver for the video game industry, experienced a precipitous decline in 2009, with US sales halving from $1.4bn in 2008 to around $700m, according to industry analysts.Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, said the impairment charge, worth 19 cents a share, reflected “the reduction in our expectations for future cash flows for that [Guitar Hero] business”.“The casual consumer in video games did not purchase in the way we would have liked last year and I think you can expect that behaviour, in these difficult economic conditions, will continue,” he said, in a Financial Times interview.Mr Kotick said he was pleased with the launch of an expansion to the franchise – DJ Hero – which features club music and a turntable rather than the guitar accessory. He said it had got off to a good start as the highest grossing new intellectual property launched in 2009 and a DJ Hero 2 had been given the green light.Fans of Rock Band, which featured a Beatles edition last year, were left disappointed when no news was announced of an expected release of Rock Band 3 and a version featuring the band Green Day, during EA’s earnings call on Monday. Instead, the company said it was looking to reduce its lower-margin distribution business – it handles the title for the media company Viacom and developer Harmonix.Activision reported fourth-quarter results ahead of Wall Street expectations with revenues of $2.5bn and profits of 49 cents a share. Analysts expected sales of $2.23bn and earnings of 43 cents a share.Its quarter was dominated by the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in November, which had a record launch for a media property and has netted more than $1bn in sales at retail so far.The company announced an annual dividend of 15 cents a share and a $1bn buy-back of its stock. Its shares rose more than 6 per cent to $10.73 in extended trading in New York.However, Activision issued a cautious outlook, predicting lower sales this year of $4.4bn, down from $4.75bn in 2009 and below analyst forecasts of $4.84bn.
148;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-02-09T21:07:32Z;Video game sector seeks way out of inferno;;Electronic Arts warned the public that “Hell Awaits” in a 30-second TV commercial during American Football’s Super Bowl last Sunday.EA’s first Super Bowl ad refers to the video game publisher’s latest title, Dante’s Inferno, launched on Tuesday in the US.However, Dante’s allegory could equally apply to burned investors suffering from an industry embroiled in the flames of slumping sales.Activision Blizzard, the largest video game publisher reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but number-two Electronic Arts gave a pessimistic outlook when it presented third-quarter earnings on Monday, predicting a 3 per cent fall in worldwide industry sales of disc-based games.There are chances of salvation for the industry this year in the shape of the Apple iPad console, which was unveiled in recent weeks – as well as motion-sensing controllers for existing ones from Microsoft and Sony, and a strong line-up of games.EA also predicted digital and online sales would grow 26 per cent this year, lifting overall software sales by 8 per cent.However, excluding Nintendo, video game stocks fell by 9 per cent in January, according to an index compiled by analysts at Wedbush Morgan Securities.This came after weak holiday sales in the US and an 8 per cent fall in revenues for the US video game industry in 2009 to $19.66bn, according to NPD, a research firm.France’s Ubisoft has warned its revenues will be lower than forecast because of the weaker-than-expected performance of games titles such as Avatar, based on the 3D movie.It has also pushed back the launch of two games.Microsoft announced that year-on-year sales in the last quarter on the Xbox 360 and PC platforms had fallen by $295m, or 12 per cent.Sales of its consoles dropped 13 per cent as the group lacked attractions to lure buyers in the final quarter of 2009.For Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, sales of titles in its Guitar Hero franchise have been disappointing, as they have for the latest Tony Hawk game, in spite of its clever skateboard controller.Redemption for Activision has come in the shape of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, a blockbuster that has earned more than $1bn since its release in November.The company can expect its Blizzard division to do well with the next expansion of its World of Warcraft universe – Cataclysm – this year.Microsoft can take comfort in a 35 per cent increase in membership of its Xbox Live online service year on year in the last quarter and has high hopes for Project Natal – a motion-sensing add-on for the Xbox 360 arriving in November.Sony will introduce a similar peripheral controller this year and saw sales of its PlayStation 3 leap 87 per cent year on year in December to 1.36m units in the US, after a price cut.The Nintendo Wii sold 3.8m units in the US in December and benefited from strong sales of the Wii Sports Resort, Wii Fit Plus and New Super Mario Bros titles. Unlike the rest of the segment, the company’s shares rose 18 per cent in January.EA can console itself with the January performance of its acclaimed Mass Effect 2, a space adventure that sold more than 2m copies in its first week.With other big titles expected such as Sony’s God of War III, Take-Two’s Bioshock 2 and EA’s Fifa World Cup South Africa, a bullish Wedbush Morgan is predicting software sales will grow by at least 10 per cent this year.Publishers are benefiting from selling to a growing number of owners of present-generation consoles, with sales of the Wii, 360 and PS3 combined standing at more than 135m worldwide.Apple’s iPad, which will be available from March, will start from zero in terms of games, although existing iPhone games will work on it and developers are expected to jump on the chance to develop more.“This is a new beginning,” says Michel Guillemot, chief executive of the publisher Gameloft. “On a larger screen [which the iPad offers], you have more real estate to be able to press buttons, move fingers, throw grenades and a new category of gaming could emerge for this different form factor.”Clive Downie, head of marketing at iPhone developer ngmoco, expects the iPad to become more of a fixture in homes, given its larger size. “The iPad has raised the bar on Apple’s entry into the home as a gaming entity. This could signal a very interesting future in terms of Apple versus Sony and Microsoft within the home domain.”With most iPhone games selling for less than $10, the industry has to work out whether iPad games can move up in price and quality, making it a platform worth pursuing or one that leaves them, like Dante, in limbo for the time being.
149;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-01-28T21:57:32Z;Brothers in arms;;Jason Kingsley does not like playing computer games against his younger brother Chris.“We only play collaborative games,” he says. “I have no problem teaming up with him to fight aliens, but we don’t play against each other. It creates too much tension.”Tension, these days, could mean a boardroom crisis, as the Kingsley brothers are co-founders of Rebellion, the UK games development company behind titles such as Alien vs Predator and Call of Duty: World at War. Jason is chief executive and creative director, and Chris is chief technical officer.The Kingsleys are not unusual. The games industry is full of companies founded and run by brothers.Ubisoft, the French games publisher, was started by the five Guillemot brothers: Yves, Michel, Christian, Gerard and Claude. Codemasters, the Leamington Spa-based publisher, was founded by David and Richard Darling.In Germany, the Yerli Brothers – Cevat, Faruk and Avni – run Crytek, which is best known for the game Far Cry.In the US, Karthik and Guha Bala are the founders of Vicarious Visions, the Activision studio that developed Guitar Hero.There are many others, from Jagex, launched by Andrew and Paul Gower, to Rare, the UK studio founded by Tim and Chris Stamper and bought by Microsoft in 2002.The reason for this statistical oddity has to do with both human nature and an accident of history.The UK games industry, in particular, has its roots in the 1980s, when a legion of schoolboys started using early computers and writing their own games.“It’s obvious that two boys with an interest in computer games would feed off each other,” says Paul Collyer, who set up Sports Interactive, the maker of Football Manager, with his brother Oliver.Many games company founders started very young. Karthik Bala was 15 and his brother Guha 14 when they started developing their first game. It took five years to finish and they think only brothers would have persevered.“Doing it with your brother is different to having a high school band that splits up when you all go your separate ways after graduation,” says Karthik. “We thought it would make us rich and famous, but neither of those things happened. We didn’t receive the royalties we were promised and were left with a lot of debt. It was a difficult time but was a revelation – it was not just about building a game but building a business.”Yves Guillemot, chief executive of Ubisoft, believes the talent of five brothers was an advantage for the company, especially in the early days. “My brother Michel saw it was going to be a big opportunity and called his brothers to help him. We had all been to university, so the company got people it would not have been able to recruit otherwise as a small business,” he says.Deciding who takes what role has been relatively easy for most brothers, as there is often a natural division of labour.“Cevat is the technological and creative genius,” says Avni Yerli, managing director of Crytek. “I do the strategic planning. My brother Faruk, who has a background in marketing, is in charge of the studio operations.”Of course, the arrangement is not always purely beneficial, and many of the brothers say they “frequently” disagree.“We have come close to killing each other,” says Guha Bala. “We have even had to have some parental involvement to sort things out.” Now that they run a studio of more than 200 people, the brothers have to keep things professional rather than personal.Such close-knit partnerships can also leave employees feeling excluded. A senior manager at one games company run by brothers comments: “There were definitely some decisions that were taken at the boardroom table and some that were taken round the kitchen table.”But Guha Bala insists that arguments are important. “The advantage of brothers is that the gloves can really come off,” he says. “You can be very honest with each other if you think something isn’t right.”
150;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2010-01-12T19:44:37Z;Vivendi and Vodafone might prefer status quo;;This is that time of year when French companies and politicians indulge in the quaint tradition of holding receptions to wish everyone a happy new year and express their hopes for the future. President Nicolas Sarkozy is currently doing just that with daily meetings across the country.Jean-Bernard Levy, chief executive of Vivendi, has already trotted out his annual wish list that includes buying out his UK partner in his SFR French telecoms business. For the past couple of years, Mr Levy has regularly said he would like to buy out Vodafone’s 44 per cent stake in SFR to gain full ownership.The irony is that when the French entertainment and telecoms conglomerate nearly collapsed following the extravagant acquisition strategy of its former boss, Jean-Marie Messier, it was ready to sell control of SFR to Vodafone for a song.Times have changed and Vivendi has been on a roll. Mr Levy first consolidated his hold on the company’s music business – Universal Music.He then merged his electronic games business with Activision creating another sector leader. He is in the process of buying out minority shareholders in his French pay-television company, Canal Plus, and has been expanding his telecoms activities in faster growing emerging markets, snatching the Brazilian broadband operator GVT under the nose of Spain’s Telefónica.In the process, just before Christmas he disposed of his remaining 20 per cent stake in the General Electric-controlled NBC Universal. He now intends to buy out the remaining GVT minorities and delist the Brazilian company.Buying out Vodafone’s minority stake in SFR would clearly complete his strategy of gaining full ownership of all his French assets. The question is does Vodafone intend to sell?Its chief executive Vittorio Colao suggested a few months ago that he did not consider his minority stakes in Verizon Wireless and SFR as long-term assets. But he also did not say that he was ready to sell at this stage.Of course he might be tempted to reinforce his strategy of expanding in fast-growing regions around the world. But he needs a good target and plan for what to do with the cash (his SFR stake would probably be worth around €5bn to €6bn) unless he wants to see his shareholders claim it in the form of a special dividend.As for Mr Levy, he clearly has to ask himself if Vivendi has the financial strength to do this after its Brazilian deal. He would probably need to go to the markets for equity and bond financing at a time when raising money looks like it is about to get more expensive.Owning SFR outright would clearly provide Vivendi with additional cash flow as well as giving it more freedom to compete in the French market. But how would this square with its emerging markets strategy to reduce its reliance on its more mature French business?Mr Levy may also be wise to hang on to his cash until the outcome – expected any day now – of the highly publicised New York class-action case against Vivendi is known. American and French investors have claimed they were misinformed when the company, which vigorously rejects the charges, was on the brink nine years ago.So for different reasons, Vivendi and Vodafone might ultimately consider that it still probably makes better sense right now keeping the current status quo at SFR. For Vivendi, this could also help keep at bay potential activist investors that appear to be circling again around the conglomerate as a potentially interesting dismemberment candidate, especially as its strategy of gaining full ownership of its French assets would make the sale of its various pieces all the easier. Already some analysts are suggesting that the sum of its parts is probably worth 40 per cent more than the whole.VW’s American dreamVolkswagen weathered last year’s crisis in the world car market better than most. Indeed, it seems not to have even noticed there was a crisis. Its 2009 sales of 6.29m cars topped the previous year’s record of 6.23m cars. It took control of Porsche, the luxury sports car maker that had tried to take it over. It also acquired a 20 per cent stake in Japan’s Suzuki to expand its international reach and its catalogue of brands.It sold 37 per cent more cars in China, which has become its single biggest market. It continued to expand in Brazil, but there is one region where the German group is still trailing its peers – the US. Last year, it sold less than 300,000 cars in the US market where it has a measly 3 per cent share. In Detroit this week, VW executives made clear the big challenge was to address this American weakness. Thanks to new models, VW is hoping to sell at least 1m cars in the US by 2018.european.view@ft.com
151;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-12-22T21:25:29Z;Capcom warning as launch postponed;;The heavy guns of Activision’s videogame Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 scored a direct hit on Tuesday when Japanese rival Capcom postponed the launch of its own titles to avoid competition, triggering a large profits warning.The highly successful launch of Modern Warfare 2 last month saw the game pull in $550m in sales in its first five days, according to figures released by Activision, sucking up the funds that gamers had available to spend on other new titles.Capcom’s profits warning highlights both the hit-driven nature of the video-game industry and the knock-on effects of a big launch. The releases of games such as Bioshock 2 from publisher Take-Two Interactive and Splinter Cell: Conviction from Ubisoft were pushed back until after Christmas to avoid Activision’s game.The increase in competition in early 2010 has now led Capcom, one of Japan’s largest independent game software publishers, to postpone the release of its own Lost Planet 2 to the second quarter, missing its end of March financial year.Capcom had been counting on 3.7m sales of Lost Planet 2. It also postponed the release of two other games and revised down its sales forecasts for a fourth.“Capcom believes that delaying the launches of its own titles will avoid competing with these new games, maximise the sales volume of the new Capcom games, and preserve the value of the brands associated with these games,” the company said.Capcom cut its sales forecast for the year to March 2010 by 32 per cent to Y65bn ($708m). It said that operating profits would be 61 per cent below its previous forecast at Y6bn and net profit would be 77 per cent lower than expected at Y2bn.The warning came as the market closed, leaving its shares unchanged at Y1,447 in Tokyo.Kazuhiko Abe, Capcom’s CFO, said that there was no issue with the development of Lost Planet 2, which was ready for release on schedule, but rather it was a strategic decision to maximise sales.In video game jargon, Lost Planet 2 is a third-person shooter – based on gunplay with the player-controlled character visible on screen – set in a science fiction universe. Its natural audience is similar to that of the Modern Warfare and Bioshock franchises, which are first-person shooters.Capcom also said it would take an exceptional charge of Y4.5bn, partly offset by a Y1.8bn tax refund, to cover restructuring costs in its amusement arcade business.Videogame software has grown rapidly as an industry and had global sales of $32bn in 2008, according to market researcher Media Control GfK.Investors have become frustrated by the risks of game publishing, however. For example, Take-Two made a large profit in 2008 with the success of Grand Theft Auto 4, but fell to a $138m loss this year without a similar hit.
152;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-12-21T19:41:38Z;Games guru puts his finger on chart success;;Inside the San Francisco offices of iPhone application maker Ngmoco, across from the Giants’ baseball stadium, the forces of modern games are colliding.Neil Young, chief executive, left Electronic Arts, one of the two leading electronic gaming companies, to start Ngmoco last year to take advantage of big developments in the industry.First, games that did not require a lot of time or processing power, such as the role-playing games Mobsters and Mafia Wars, had started to spread on MySpace and Facebook.Social games have a financial advantage over console games, where Electronic Arts and Activision are strongest, because they require much less up-front investment and because they can be improved daily in response to how they are played. Distribution costs can be as little as zero, if friends convince other friends to play.Second, in 2008 Apple announced that it would open its Apple Store to outsiders, putting nearly any developer with a great product a few finger-taps away from millions of iPhone users.“It felt like one of those inflection moments. This felt like one of the biggest,” Mr Young said, and in March he started assembling a cadre of like-minded industry veterans and venture funding.In the year-and-a-half since, the company – which has fewer than 40 employees – has landed six games in Apple’s Top Ten charts, notching up more than 10m downloads.One of the guiding principles that Ngmoco espouses is to combine games with a heavy social component, so that people interact while playing and thus recruit additional players. Another is that games should be free to play, but that spending money inside them should make them more enjoyable. Ngmoco’s Eliminate did that so well that it became the first game to make the separate Top Ten charts for free games and also for top-grossing games.In June, Ngmoco became the latest gamemaker to deploy a social network for its games and those of partners, so that the players who know each other from one imagined world can find each other in another, while the company cross-promotes its wares.But all of that is so far only on the iPhone, and that is not where Ngmoco is going to stay. “The web is the central platform,” said Clive Downie, marketing vice-president. “The question is how we make games on other devices that utilise the web as well.”
153;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-12-10T23:10:42Z;2009 Essential Gadgets – Scratch ‘n surf gaming;;The clutter of game accessories around the living-room TV continues to grow. Apart from the usual Xbox, PS3 and Wii controllers, there are the Guitar Hero instruments, some Buzz quiz-game buzzers, the Wii balance board, Mario Kart racing wheel, Lips and Singstar karaoke microphones and a camera in our set-up.But wait! We’re missing a few more. Activision Blizzard came out with two late in the year that showed great originality, although disappointing sales figures to date suggest the public is suffering console accessorisation fatigue and is not willing to pay out large sums for the latest gizmos.Activision’s DJ Hero($120), released in October, is the first major expansion of the Guitar Hero franchise into new music genres.It is an introduction to club and hip-hop music through a turntable peripheral with cross-faders that allows you to “scratch” records, match beats and change tracks.Doing all of those things in rapid succession takes some skills and this perhaps does not have the same appeal as wielding a lead guitar, but Activision deserves praise for trying something that opens up a whole new field of music and gameplay.I found the skateboard accessory in Activision’s new Tony Hawk: Ride game ($120) even more impressive. Other than having actual wheels, this represents a very realistic experience, with the player standing on a skateboard equipped with sensors that detect movements and reproduce them faithfully in the game.Tip the board back and forth to achieve an ollie or a nollie, pass one foot along the ground for the sensor to know you are trying to pick up speed.The accessory is likely to get more use in future games – snowboarding and surfing should feel even more natural – and if you do get bored with it, it’s the easiest peripheral I’ve come across so far to slide out of sight under the sofa.
154;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-12-10T22:45:30Z;China games sector on quest to innovate;;"More than 2m young Chinese at any moment can be found swinging swords, brandishing deadly claws and aiming machine guns at their enemies.As Berserkers, SoulBringers or Asuras, they delve into the virtual world of Dungeon & Fighter, currently China’s most popular online game.Some 64 per cent of China’s internet users – a staggering 217m people – are online gamers.CNZZ, a Beijing-based internet research firm, forecasts the country will account for half of the world’s online games market with Rmb41bn ($6bn) in revenues by 2012.But even with such explosive growth, it is becoming increasingly hard for game operators to grab their piece of the action.Shanda Games, one of China’s leading online gaming companies, made its name by producing so-called massively multiplayer online role-playing games such as The Legend of Mir and Warlord of the Three Kingdoms – but it says the market has become much tougher in recent years.“When you have only 10 games in the market – like when this started in China a decade ago – choosing games is a bit like choosing washing powder for users; every game still stands a chance,” says Diana Li, chief executive of Shanda Games.“But now there are more than 200 games entering the Chinese market every year, so consumers don’t even have the time to take a look at all of them, let alone [to] download them. [So] a growing number of games will never gain traction.”That is a troubling prospect for an industry with already lower valuations than other internet businesses because investors discount the risk that the next game could be a flop.Almost half of China’s 70m users of large online games have been playing for more than three years, the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), a government research institution, said in its annual survey of the industry last week.“They listen less to what gaming companies say – and more to what their peers say about a game,” says Liu Xin, a senior analyst at CNNIC.To meet these challenges, two important Chinese internet companies – Sohu and Shanda Interactive – took their games units public this year. Others try to keep up by churning out more games more quickly.“Foreign gaming companies can take up to six years to develop a game, but some Chinese companies will spend two years at most. Some will spend no more than half a year,” says Mr Liu.That has meant a vicious circle with more competition and less innovation, he adds.Executives are aware of the problem and are trying to break the pattern by seeking fresh talent outside their own company.Some firms – including Shanda and Giant Interactive – have started to invest in freelance game design teams. Others are trying to spread technical and planning skills more broadly among their development staff and to tap game players for ideas.Netdragon, a mid-size gaming company, has formed a “mercenary system” by which any user can propose ideas online that could become the seed for a fresh game.“We also realised that certain knowledge of how to plan a new game was locked up in the brains of just a few people,” says Liu Luyuan, Netdragon’s chief executive. “We are getting it out of there, enabling more people [to help develop] products.”But analysts say Chinese online games companies may need to adjust their business models beyond efforts to tweak their game development structures. “One main difference between Chinese and US gaming companies is their monetisation model. In the US, most gamers pay upfront by buying a CD,” says Alicia Yap, analyst at Citigroup. “In China, revenues are generated mainly by paying for in-game virtual items or for playing time.”Most gaming companies have concluded that to spread the risk is best.Perfect World has set up a game-related e-commerce website. Shanda Interactive also has an online literature arm, and has started to diversify into other digital content by tying up with a television company. Kingsoft is considering similar action.One company need not think about any of this: Tencent, operator of Dungeon & Fighterand three other games ranked among the top five last month by Credit Suisse in a league table of China’s most popular online games.Unlike its rivals, Tencent relies on an immense user base built by its instant messaging service, QQ, which now has nearly 500m active accounts."
155;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-11-17T23:55:52Z;Activision rides accessorisation wave;;"Activision Blizzard may have the biggest selling game of all time at launch on its hands with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, but the performance of two other key franchises is under scrutiny.Tony Hawk: Ride, was released today , with a new skateboard accessory. It follows the October 27 launch of DJ Hero, an extension of the Guitar Hero franchise, using model turntables rather than instruments.Video game publishers know they can boost revenues the more they accessorise their products – a limited-edition version of Modern Warfare 2 with souvenir military night goggles costs $150, but has been selling for as much as $700 on Amazon.But there may be limits to the public’s spending and appetite for yet another working accessory to add to the clutter around the television.Sales of DJ Hero, which retails at $120, twice what a disk-only game costs, have been lacklustre since its launch, according to analysts.Cowen and Company reduced its estimate for fourth-quarter US sales from 1.6m to 600,000, and first-year estimates from 2.5m to 950,000.The turntable is intuitive to use for players wanting to “scratch” like a hip-hop DJ, but they may not exist in the same numbers as the air guitarists who prefer Guitar Hero.Wedbush Morgan analysts predict DJ Hero will be “a modest success, but supply constraints and a limited audience could limit sales. It is not clear to us that this game is a ‘franchise’, particularly if the initial installed base is below 2m.”In contrast, the Tony Hawk: Ride skateboard bundle – another $120 purchase – seems a natural extension of a franchise that has shifted more than 40m units but had nowhere else to go. Moves on the skateboard, which is minus its wheels, are faithfully reproduced on-screen in a dramatic enhancement of a game previously played with a standard controller.Ride seems to have more going for it than DJ Hero, although it does launch at the same time as two other titles many gamers feel they must have this year – Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed II and EA’s Left 4 Dead 2.
Meanwhile, sales of Modern Warfare 2 have probably been helped rather than hindered by controversy over its “No Russian” level, where you may find scenes disturbing that show terrorists carrying out an airport massacre of civilians.Questions have been asked in the British parliament about the game level and Activision today described reports that the game had been banned in Russia as “erroneous” – the scene was removed from the PC version of the game on sale there, it said."
156;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
157;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-11-13T20:40:19Z;Profits of doom;The world has its first interactive blockbuster;"Ultranationalists have seized power in Moscow and launched an invasion of the US east coast. A splinter group of theirs has turned to terrorism, a Russian nuclear submarine has been hijacked and latest indications are that a missile from the vessel has destroyed the International Space Station.An American soldier who managed to infiltrate the terrorists has meanwhile found himself forced to remain undercover and aid them as they carry out a grisly airport massacre.These were the chilling developments that unfolded this week on millions of screens in the US and beyond. For all its realism, though, the action was virtual – which is fortunate both for the world at large and for Bobby Kotick, chief executive of the world’s biggest video game publisher.Mr Kotick achieved a long-held ambition as he gained the status of Hollywood’s first virtual movie mogul. The head of Activision Blizzard saw the company’s latest title – Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – become a bigger launch hit than any mere film in history.“Being here in Los Angeles for the last 20 years, I always knew that the promise existed to build interactive entertainment for broad audiences and that we were at some point going to deliver something that would beat all box office records,” he says. Setting a new mark in sales for all forms of entertainment, the title grossed $310m (£186m, €208m) from the 4.7m copies sold in the first 24 hours in North America and the UK alone.“It’s the first true interactive Hollywood blockbuster,” says Mr Kotick, referring to the video game industry’s long journey to match the movie industry in storytelling and convincing characterisation and action.To all but hardcore gamers interested in combat, the “first-person shooter” genre of games, where players look through gun sights at an enemy, has had all the appeal of a bad martial arts movie. But Modern Warfare 2 is on a level with Hollywood action films such as The Bourne Identity series or a Bond picture in its allure for a more general audience.“I can’t explain its appeal any better than I can explain the appeal of The Dark Knightor Britney Spears; it’s just a fact that millions of people really like the game,” says Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities. “It’s in the ‘special’ category – a game that is approachable, fun, relatively easy to complete and which has a ton of replayability.”Its success is not just due to its action movie-like qualities. Continuity from the previous Modern Warfare title has also been maintained through “map packs” that offered fresh combat scenes, as well as through online multi-player gaming, which maintained audience involvement and increased anticipation for the new game. The airport massacre scene has drawn alarmed attention from politicians and the media on both sides of the Atlantic, only heightening interest among players.The release comes at the end of a tough year for the video game and retail industry. Software sales are down in the recession and video game companies have been restructuring and closing studios. Mr Kotick argues that his game’s success could have a wider effect: “Retailers like Toys ‘R’ Us, who never got behind games for 18 to 35-year-olds, got behind this in a big way. I think they realised that to have shoppers coming in buying products for their kids, having a single item that they can buy for themselves is not such a bad idea.”Modern Warfare 2 tops records set by Grand Theft Auto IV in 2008 and Halo 3 in 2007. Available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for $60, or more than $200 for a special edition that includes night goggles, it is being sold into a larger market of console owners. There are now about 58m owners of those consoles, compared with about 21m who had an Xbox or PlayStation in 2007 when the first Modern Warfare appeared.That first version has sold more than 14m units worldwide, making it the best-selling first-person shooter to date. Todd Greenwald, video game analyst at Signal Hill, a boutique investment bank, says the credit for this goes to Infinity Ward, the Californian studio bought by Activision in 2003. “There are only a few studios out there like this, whether it’s Infinity Ward, or Bungie [Halo] or Rockstar [Grand Theft Auto], that are able to create such high-quality content. It’s just a great game – the graphics, the intensity of the gameplay, the story, it’s just unmatched.”The company has spent $200m to develop and promote the game but has made that back in less than a day. It expects to go on making money from it for a long time to come with episodic content – more than 7.5m map packs were sold to gamers wanting to extend the life of the game.Modern Warfare 2 picks up the story line of its predecessor – and all the more gruesomely. The airport scene, for the first time in a video game, is preceded by a warning: “The following mission may be disturbing or offensive to some players. You may skip this mission at any time.”The mission and its warning have raised familiar questions about the level of violence in video games, in spite of the ‘M’ (Mature) rating given to the game. “A popular new video game actually allows you to be a terrorist and kill people,” said the presenter of a Fox News programme in a segment this week. “Is this fantasy game just a little too real?”There were media stories in the UK as well, and questions in parliament. Keith Vaz, a Labour MP, asked what the government was doing to protect children from a game that “contains scenes of such brutality that even the manufacturers have put warnings in the game telling people how they can skip particular scenes”.A debate on video game violence took place in San Francisco on Wednesday when industry leaders were shown Moral Kombat, a new documentary on the subject. The film presents views from all sides on violent games such as Doom – blamed in part for the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado – and Mortal Kombat. A panel then discussed the responsibilities of developers, publishers, retailers, the media and parents.Lorne Lanning, one of the panellists and a developer of the Oddworld game series, sees the airport sequence as deliberately controversial. “The authors knew exactly what they were doing, it’s a pretty predictable media response so it’s not an accident,” he says. “When a game is flagged by the media as controversial, it’s going to sell a lot more units, so there are strategic plays at work here.”Dean Takahashi, video game author, longtime player and writer for the Venturebeat blog, says he was shocked by the scene. “You really do cross a line when you give the player no options except to be a very evil character. In that scene, you can’t stop the slaughter from happening. Most games give you an option of choosing between being good or evil.”Still, he maintains, the sequence is softened by few women and no children or elderly people being mowed down, adding that the shock is really in the moral predicament in which players find themselves. “Infinity Ward have a history of taking you to the edge of your comfort zone. I would say it’s defensible content because they are trying to make some kind of point, they’re trying to make you think and they want you to feel exactly what it’s like when there’s violence going on like this.”Rob Kostich, head of marketing for Call of Duty, says the developer saw it as a story element designed to have an impact on the player at many levels. “It makes you stop dead in your tracks. It makes you realise the atrocity of this given situation.”Modern Warfare’s sales and the release of Assassin’s Creed by Ubisoft and New Super Mario Bros by Nintendo are expected to make November and December strong months for the industry. Signal Hill’s Mr Greenwald says that for all the attempts by Nintendo to expand the age range of gamers with its motion-controlled Wii console, the new Wii gamers do not buy many titles and Modern Warfare is evidence that the casual player is needed to add to the hardcore gamers who keep coming back to buy games. “They may not buy everything in a year like this, but when a big franchise comes around they are all over it and they are telling their friends.”Or as Mr Kotick, dealing with that rush, puts it: “I don’t know that there’s anything a company can do itself to plan for a popular cultural phenomenon, but it definitely feels like we’re having one now with Modern Warfare.”"
158;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-11-13T03:06:06Z;Vivendi sees underlying profits up 10.3%;;Vivendi, Europe’s largest entertainment group by sales, recorded a 10.3 per cent increase in underlying profits in the first nine months of the year, driven by its successful games division and cost-cutting in its pay-TV business.Vivendi’s performance owed much to the consolidation of Activision Blizzard, maker of hit games such as World of Warcraft and Guitar Hero, in which it has a 57 per cent stake.Activision recorded strong sales and profit growth from January to September, a period that excludes the release of its latest blockbuster, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which sold a record 4.7m copies in North America and the UK on its release on Tuesday.Philippe Capron, chief executive, said the phenomenal launch meant that Vivendi was “confident” that the games division would do “as least as much as expected” in terms of sales in the final quarter.The performance of the US-based games maker provides a vindication of Vivendi’s decision to merge its games division with Activision to create Activision Blizzard. It comes as the French group is struggling to pull off other sizeable acquisitions. Its offer for GVT, the Brazilian broadband provider, has been trumped by a higher offer from Telefónica of Spain.Presenting Vivendi’s results in a call with analysts, Philippe Capron, chief financial officer, declined to comment about the GVT deal, or whether the French company intended to sell its 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal, the US film studio and broadcaster.Vivendi posted a 5.1 per cent increase in earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (ebita) in the third quarter to €1.346bn (£1.21bn, $2bn) and a 2.5 per cent decline in sales to €6.347bn.The rise in profits from June to September was led by SFR, France’s second-largest mobile provider which is 55 per cent owned by Vivendi, and by Canal+, the pay-TV group, which is seeing strong subscription growth in France and in Poland, the full fruits of its merger with satellite rival TPS.SFR showed a strong commercial performance, adding a net 573,000 new mobile customers in the first nine months of the year.Vivendi was once again weighed down by the decline of its music business, where rising digital revenues are rising slower than physical record sales are falling. Universal Music Group sales were down 11.7 per cent in the third quarter and ebita fell 61.1 per cent, partly because of a lack of new releases.Mr Capron said Vivendi was still aiming for UMG to return to a profit margin of 10 per cent in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, growth in Maroc Telecom – in which Vivendi has a 51 per cent stake – had “stalled” Mr Capron said, but the operator still expected to notch up a margin of 45 per cent.
159;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-11-06T22:22:20Z;Wall St shrugs off jobs report;;Gains by General Electric, Starbucks and the world’s biggest video games company, Activision Blizzard, helped Wall Street shrug off disappointing jobs data in choppy trading on Friday.The S&P 500 spent less than 15 minutes in the red after October’s non-farm payrolls report showed that the US unemployment rate had risen to 10.2 per cent.However, stocks soon fell again and the S&P turned negative 15 times throughout the day, finally closing 0.3 per cent higher at 1,069.30.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 10,023.42 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,112.44.In spite of volatile trading, Wall Street has closed higher every day this week.A sell-off in the financial sector, both on Monday afternoon and just before the closing bell on Wednesday, weighed on the market but the S&P still managed to cling to positive territory.Disappointing economic data also failed to shake the confidence of investors who remained focused on the gradual improvement in economic conditions.Positive results from Cisco on Thursday added to a rally in technology stocks, giving the Nasdaq its biggest daily gain since July.As a result, Wall Street on Friday recorded its first weekly gain in three weeks. The S&P was up 3.2 per cent on the week, the Dow also gained 3.2 per cent and the Nasdaq climbed 3.3 per cent.“The unemployment number was pretty scary but we’re seeing two different stories here,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams. “The strong earnings out of Cisco and some more tech earnings today are trumping the unemployment number, so we’re having a rebound. But the question is: when is the unemployment number going to start affecting the big companies? If a lot of people get laid off, they’re going to stop spending.”The industrials sector outperformed the market throughout the day, led by General Electric shares that rose 6.2 per cent to $15.33 after an upgrade from Bernstein.A Bernstein upgrade also boosted shares in Amazon, the online retailer, lifting the stock 4.6 per cent to $126.20.Starbucks also encouraged investors, gaining 7.2 per cent to $21.12 after the coffee chain posted higher-than-expected quarterly profits and raised its outlook for 2010.The Seattle-based group has struggled to transform itself over the past year in the face of tougher competition, changing its product lines and slashing costs.Activision Blizzard rose 3.5 per cent to $11.25 after reporting higher quarterly revenue than analysts had been expecting.The Californian group said strong sales of the “Guitar Hero” game helped to offset an industry-wide decline in video game software sales in the third quarter.However, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage finance agencies, were some of the market’s biggest casualties both on Friday and throughout the week.After the market’s close on Thursday, Fannie Mae said it would draw another $15bn of funds from the US Treasury after a ninth consecutive quarterly loss drove its net worth below zero. Its shares were down 7.1 per cent at $1.04 on Friday and off 3.7 per cent from last week.Freddie Mac, which is also backed by the government, was down 1.6 per cent to $1.23.American International Group also weighed on the market on Friday.The government-supported insurer reported its second successive quarterly profit after investment losses diminished.But its shares dropped 9.7 per cent to $35.48 after sales declines at its property-casualty operations, which include coverage of commercial buildings, corporate boards and aircraft, and life insurance divisions
160;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;‘Call of Duty’ set to boost Activision;;The video game industry may begin to pull out of its 2009 slump next week as Activision Blizzard, its largest publisher, launches what is expected to be the biggest game of this, or any year.Pre-orders for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the latest in the series of “first-person shooter” games, are “higher than for any previous Activision title”, the company said on Thursday in its third-quarter earnings statement.“We project [it] could be the largest entertainment launch of the year,” it added, implying its initial sales will beat any other video game, movie or book launch in 2009.GameStop has gone further, predicting that Modern Warfare 2 will be the biggest launch in the retailer’s history when it goes on sale next Tuesday, based on record pre-orders for the title.The release of Halo 3 in September 2007 holds the current record for an industry launch. It earned $300m in worldwide sales for its publisher Microsoft in its first week.Since then, the number of owners of the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii consoles has grown substantially and analysts at Wedbush Morgan Securities predict $500m in global sales for Modern Warfare 2 in its first week.They say Activision could “easily sell 10m units in Q4”.The fourth quarter, traditionally the biggest for the industry due to Christmas and the US holiday season sales, could restore publishers’ fortunes after six months of double-digit sales declines in the US between March and August. Sales grew slightly in September following cuts in console prices.Activision claimed on Thursday it had the strongest holiday release schedule in the industry. Apart from Modern Warfare 2, it includes music-based games DJ Hero and Band Hero, Tony Hawk Ride, which has a skateboard accessory, and Bakugan Battle Brawlers, based on the popular TV show.“The products that we’re putting in the market are the best that we’ve ever created,” said Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard chief executive.“The great unknown is whether this economy results in consumers spending less money or not showing up at all,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “That’s going to have an impact on everybody and there’s nothing that we’ve really seen that would suggest the economy is turning round, so I think there’s risk.”Activision reported better than expected sales in its third quarter. Revenues of $755m beat Wall Street estimates of $726m and its own guidance of $700m. Earnings of 4 cents a share were as expected.Sales were driven by the launch of Guitar Hero 5 in September and the success of its ‘World of Warcraft’online role-playing game.The publisher expects sales to almost triple in the fourth quarter to $2.2bn for profits of 43 cents a share.
161;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-10-12T16:33:35Z;China bans foreign investment in online games;;China has banned foreign investment in its online gaming industry in a tightening of its censorship regime and an effort to protect local gaming companies.Foreigners would be banned from operating online gaming within China through wholly foreign-owned investments, joint ventures or any other forms of co-operation with local companies, the country’s publishing regulator said. The notice put up on the website of the General Administration of Press and Publication on Saturday is the latest of Beijing’s steps this year to tighten control over China’s booming virtual worlds.Earlier this year, GAPP announced that online games could only be launched after it had approved them, adding to the risk in marketing products that can take years to develop.When Netease, one of the country’s leading internet portals, won the licence formerly held by The9, a smaller gaming operator, to operate Blizzard’s World of Warcraft in China, the government delayed approval for the company’s co-operation with Blizzard.Revenues in China’s online gaming market are expected to grow by up to half this year to Rmb27bn according to GAPP. The industry is dominated by domestic companies such as Tencent, Changyou, Shanda – which launched its shares on Nasdaq in September – Netease and The9.However, many of them still make a large part of their revenues from foreign-developed games, for which they have to pay royalties. World of Warcraft is China’s most popular game on the web.“The cost for developing new games is rising exponentially, and many Chinese online gaming companies face the threat that they can no longer afford to develop games and will see themselves forced into agreements to distribute foreign games,” said Edward Yu, head of Analysys, a Beijing-based research firm. “Partly, this new policy is an attempt to protect local gaming companies.”Analysts said the move was unlikely to lock foreign online gaming companies out of the market because GAPP is only one of several regulators. The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for Industry and Information Technology also have a stake in regulating online industries and could take different views, especially as GAPP’s move increases the publishing agency’s powers versus the other regulators.“But things are getting ever more difficult,” Mr Yu said.GAPP said updates and new versions of already-approved games would need additional approval. It also said games that were already on the market in China would need new approval if they changed distributors.
162;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-09-23T19:58:43Z;Microsoft claims big support for Natal;;Microsoft threw down the gauntlet to game rival Sony in the race to develop a challenger to Nintendo’s Wii, saying that most top game publishers were developing products for the US group’s Xbox 360 motion controller.Publishers that accounted for 70 per cent of third-party software sales were making games for the Natal controller, said Don Mattrick, head of Microsoft’s videogame division.Natal uses an infrared camera to measure a gamer’s motion in three dimensions and turn it into input for a game. In one demonstration, a user can drive a car by turning an imaginary steering wheel and pressing an imaginary pedal, without the need for a physical controller.Natal and Sony’s equivalent, both due out next year, are at the heart of the battle to differentiate between the consoles and compete with Nintendo’s Wii.Publisher support is vital because sales of the motion controllers will depend on the games that use them.Sony’s controller uses a conventional camera to track a device in the player’s hands. The motion sensor in Nintendo’s Wii that made that console a success after its launch in 2006 uses accelerometers built into a handheld controller.Nintendo’s Wii has sold 50m units compared with 30m Xbox 360s and 24m PS3s. Nintendo has attracted new people into gaming with its intuitive, motion-sensing controls and focus on casual games.Both Microsoft and Sony have cut their console prices,hoping their motion controllers will help them draw in new customers.Mr Mattrick said: “Traditionally inside the industry, [the launch of innovative hardware is] when new hits get created, when new categories get defined, when things that have driven billions of dollars of sales get created.“We think that’s a substantial opportunity for our third-party publishers.”All five of Japan’s top publishers – Capcom, Konami, Namco Bandai, Sega and Square Enix – are developing games for Natal.In the US, Activision Blizzard, Bethesda Softworks, Disney Interactive, Electronic Arts and MTV Games were developing for Natal, as was Ubisoft of France, Mr Mattrick said.At the Tokyo Games Show, which opens on Thursday, Microsoft will host a discussion on the gaming possibilities of Natal with the Japanese developers behind such hit games as Capcom’s Dead Rising, Sega’s Super Monkey Ball, and Konami’s Metal Gear Solid series of espionage thrillers.It is not yet clear whether publishers are developing games that work with only Natal or that support Natal and Sony’s motion controller as options alongside traditional control.In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Yoichi Wada, the president of Square Enix video game publisher, said he expected the new motion controllers to have a limited impact on console sales, because they improved gaming but did not add an entirely new function.
163;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-09-16T23:32:32Z;Beatles game beats Viacom’s projections;;Sales of The Beatles: Rock Band have exceeded expectations, Viacom said on Wednesday, even as the first sales figures since the video game launched last week indicated that Activision’s rival Guitar Hero 5 game appeared to have the edge in the battle of the bands.“It’s been terrific,” said Philippe Dauman, chief executive of Viacom, which owns MTV Games and Rock Band developer Harmonix. “Sales have exceeded our internal projections and we’ve sold 25 per cent of our inventory in the first week,” he told a Goldman Sachs media conference in New York.However, the latest in the rival Guitar Hero franchise was the best-selling title across all video game formats in the UK last week, Gfk Charttrack reported, in spite of being on sale for only two days during the reporting period.While Guitar Hero 5 hit number one, The Beatles: Rock Band was number four in the all-formats chart. Official US figures will not be available until next month.Dan Rosensweig, head of the Guitar Hero division at Activision, told the Financial Times it had seen no impact from the heavily-marketed Beatles game. “It did not affect our sales”. He added that Guitar Hero outsold Rock Band by four to one in the US and nine to one in other markets.Industry executives hope the Beatles game will expand the market for music-themed games by bringing in older players and more women. Up to the end of August, music game sales were down 46 per cent on the previous year, according to the NPD research firm.Mr Rosensweig said DJ Hero was the more likely product to expand the market, highlighting Activision’s next launch as a means of bringing in people interested in dance music and other genres to a market so far dominated by rock bands.Mr Rosensweig emphasised the “value proposition” in a tough consumer spending climate of a $99 product offering 85 songs and a guitar controller. He added that Activision, part owned by Vivendi, would remain focused on keeping market share.Mr Dauman said he expected the operating profit margin for the Beatles game to reach 20 per cent, but did not give further details.Viacom would consider small investments to acquire intellectual properties such as Harmonix, the makers of Rock Band, he added, but he ruled out big acquisitions.
164;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-09-06T22:37:58Z;Nintendo ponders next move after rivals’ cuts;Games group faces tough battle;"It is Nintendo’s move. Over the summer, its video game rivals Sony and Microsoft have made large cuts to the price of their Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. Whether and how Nintendo responds will shape what is likely to be the Japanese company’s most difficult Christmas since it launched the Wii in 2006.In the past three years there has been little change in the video game industry’s pecking order. The Wii, with its innovative motion-sensing controller, has been a runaway success, leaving Sony’s high-powered but expensive PS3 to fight a difficult battle with Microsoft for second place.The Wii has sold more than 50m around the world; the Xbox 360, which launched a year earlier, more than 30m; and the Playstation 3 more than 20m.The round of price cuts, however, combined with the Wii’s loss of momentum this year, has raised the prospect that its dominance may yet be challenged.The price cuts have also improved Sony’s competitive position relative to Microsoft, its most direct rival, although at the likely cost of continued losses on every machine that it sells.Sony has launched a redesigned PS3 Slim and cut its US price from $399 to $299. Microsoft has held the price of its cheapest Xbox 360 Arcade, which has no hard disk drive, at $199 and cut the price of its Elite model to $299. Nintendo has so far kept the Wii at $249 – a level that has not changed since its launch – and the pricing structures are similar in other markets around the world.The cuts by its rivals mean Nintendo has lost the ability to market the Wii as the cheapest console.However, Nintendo has said that it has no plan to cut prices at this point in time.Hiroshi Kamide, an analyst at KBC Securities in Tokyo, said: “Nintendo feel their product is so differentiated that they have no need to follow suit.”Another result of the cuts is that while Microsoft also cut the price of its most expensive Xbox 360, the gap between the PS3 and its cheapest rival has narrowed by $100, which should help to make Sony price competitive for the first time since 2006.That is especially true because, for the same $299 price as Microsoft’s 360 Elite, the PS3 offers free online gaming and can also play Blu-ray DVD discs. Both consoles can run a similar selection of game titles from third-party publishers.At issue is whether the price cuts will actually change consumers’ buying patterns. “It’s reasonable to expect the Playstation to do a bit better year-on-year but the real question is whether there will be quality games to drive hardware sales,” says Mr Kamide.Nintendo attributes this year’s slower sales of the Wii to the later release of its big software titles. It expects that to change with the recent launch of Wii Sports Resort – which simulates sports such as golf, table tennis and basketball using the console’s motion-sensitive controller – and the upcoming Wii Fit Plus and New Super Mario Brothers Wii.Third-party publishers look set to release fewer of their top games this Christmas, however, after intense competition last year hurt sales.A number of big releases have been postponed to 2010, includingBioshock 2, billed as the thinking man’s shooting game, Bayonetta from Sega, Ubisoft’s Xbox 360 exclusive Splinter Cell: Conviction, and Sony’s own Heavy Rain.The reduced number of games, along with the recession, may mean that even the price cuts do not necessarily result in a record Christmas for hardware sales.Consumers may also look to next year and the promised release of motion-sensing controllers for both the Xbox 360 and PS3, including Microsoft’s innovative Project Natal, which does away with the need for a handheld controller altogether.www.ft.com/techblog"
165;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-09-02T17:06:01Z;Transition to digital tests Warner Bros;;Few have a better perspective on whether the video games industry faces a digital challenge akin to that of the film business than Kevin Tsujihara.As president of Warner Bros’ home entertainment group, he is responsible for both its response to declining DVD sales and its push into games.Since his division was formed in 2005, Mr Tsujihara has expanded a small in-house team by buying into developers such as Eidos, Traveller’s Tales and much of Sumner Redstone’s Midway Games, bringing in brands such as Lara Croft, Lego Star Wars and Mortal Kombat.“At its core, the video games business is about creating and distributing content,” Mr Tsujihara says.Big media groups such as Time Warner, Warner Bros’ parent, understand content franchises.They can use their retail relationships from the DVD business to provide global distribution that small games developers could not hope to achieve alone.Ties to platforms such as iTunes and Amazon.com offer the prospect of carrying that advantage to the digital arena.Compelling growth rates in games have drawn several media groups to invest heavily in the industry, from Vivendi, the majority owner of Activision Blizzard, to Walt Disney, which this week highlighted the games opportunities in its deal to buy Marvel Entertainment.The past year has shown that video games are not immune to a consumer spending slump, but Mr Tsujihara is undaunted.“As opportunities come up, we’re going to continue to be very aggressive.”Although slower console sales have weighed on the software market, he believes games offer sufficient value to give Warner’s business model some protection.A game is “a 40-50 hour experience”, unlike the two to three hours of entertainment offered by a DVD.“There will be a digital transition, just as there was in music and just as there is in movies and TV,” he says.But if the games business is clever, he believes, it can avoid those businesses’ bruising experience with piracy by using that transition to offer consumers more value.Mr Tsujihara says developers should use technology “to augment packaged media” with downloadable add-ons, staying a step ahead of free games online or the second-hand games market.Yet there are challenges.Warner must keep pace with technological change, which has turned Apple’s iPhone and incarnations of Google’s Android mobile platform into games machines.It must strike a balance between giving spread-out developer teams freedom and risking losing economies of scale.For now, he says, these challenges are outweighed by the opportunities, even if games experience the decline in sales of physical products that the music and film businesses have faced.“You’re going to get much higher margins in digital.”
166;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-09-01T21:56:34Z;Video game sales boost Vivendi;;Vivendi, the French telecoms and entertainment group, on Tuesday reported a 10.4 per cent increase in profit in the second quarter, driven by strength in its video games division.The company also produced better than expected profits in its French mobile phone and pay-TV business, underlining the attractions of its subscription-based business model during a recession that has hammered other media groups more dependent on advertising.“This crisis has consequences for us but they are limited,” said Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive. The results bore witness to Vivendi’s “very good resilience against the crisis”.Mr Lévy maintained the company’s guidance for “strong ebita growth” and a dividend distribution rate of at least 50 per cent.Earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation rose by 10.4 per cent in the second quarter to €1.51bn ($2.1bn) and by 12.9 per cent in the first half of the year to €2.9bn. Sales in the second quarter were up by 11 per cent at €6.65bn.The increase in sales came on the back of last year’s merger of Vivendi’s video games division with Activision to create Activision Blizzard, the world’s biggest games business by sales, in which Vivendi has a 56 per cent stake. Ebita at the combined games entity more than tripled in the first half on the same period last year.Canal +, the pay-TV division, reported a 36.4 per cent increase in ebita, as it trimmed customer churn, cut costs and even notched up a 15 per cent increase in advertising revenues.SFR, the telecommunications arm which includes France’s second largest mobile operator, did better than its rivals in recruiting new customers, adding a net 559,000 subscribers following strong demand for its iPhone handset.It also cut the rate of churn among its subscribers by 3.4 per cent. SFR made €32m of cost savings in following its full merger Neuf Cegetel, the high speed broadband provider, last year.The black spot in Vivendi’s performance was once again the Universal Music Group, the world’s largest music company by sales. The inexorable decline of physical recordings reduced sales by 1.7 per cent and ebita by 18.5 per cent in the first half.Yet, with ebita excluding restructuring costs of €248m on sales of €2bn, UMG was still producing a double-digit margin, supported by merchandising sales and the growth of digital music. Digital sales accounted for 29 per cent of revenues, 40 per cent in the US.Mr Lévy said the company would continue to seek out potential acquisitions in high-growth emerging markets to help balance its mature businesses.In July, the French group abandoned talks with Zain, the Kuwaiti telecoms group, over the purchase of its African operations in a deal worth between $10bn-11bn. Vivendi said the price was too high. Mr Lévy said talks were “over”.He also scotched suggestions that the French group might increase its stake in NBC Universal, the US broadcaster and film studios. “Our strategy is to consider this asset non-core,” he said.Vivendi’s priority would be to buy-out minority stakes in its core businesses when the time and price were right, he added. These include stakes in Canal+ held by terrestrial broadcasters TF1 and M6 and Vodafone’s 45 per cent share in SFR.
167;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-08-06T01:12:45Z;Activision results cast shadow over rival EA;;Activision Blizzard reaffirmed its position as the dominant video game publisher by reporting another strong quarter on Wednesday, one day after its rival, Electronic Arts, reported widening losses and shrinking revenue.Activision Blizzard, based in Santa Monica, reported profits of $195m, up from $28m a year earlier. The drastically improved results are thanks to the success of Activision’s union with Blizzard, the Vivendi Games unit with which it completed a merger one year ago.The sevenfold increase in profits was largely due to an increase in subscribers to Blizzard Entertainment’s World of Warcraft, as well as strong sales of two games pegged to summer movies, and the enduring popularity of the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero franchises.”Since our merger one year ago, we have delivered better-than-expected financial performance for four consecutive quarters,” said Activision Blizzard chief executive Robert Kotick. Revenues at the company were $1bn, up from $352m a year ago.On Tuesday Electronic Arts reported that losses widened and revenues fell over the past three months. EA, based in Redwood City, lost $234m in the three months through July, compared with $95m during the same time last year.“The industry is weaker than we originally expected and we remain cautious,” Electronic Arts chief executive John Riccitiello said on Tuesday.But the world’s second-largest video game maker had a better than expected quarter thanks to some well-timed releases. Sales of The Sims 3, the latest release in one of the industry’s best-selling franchises, and EA Sports Active, a new title for the Nintendo Wii.The starkly differing quarters for the two largest pure-play video game makers underscores the importance of enduring franchises, and the reliability of the hard-core gaming market even amidst the recession.“The guys with hard-core games tend to do better than the casual guys,” said Michael Pachter, video game analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities. He pointed to poor results from Ubisoft and Nintendo, the two leading casual gaming companies.Strong results from Activision Blizzard, however, do not signal the wholesale revival of the video game industry. US videogame sales dropped 31 per cent in June, from $1.7bn a year earlier to $1.17bn, according NPD Group.“We haven’t turned around,” said Mr Pachter. But, he said, “starting in September things are going to be gigantic.” A torrent of new releases is slated in advance of the holiday season. “It’s crowded in a good way,” he said.Activision Blizzard will be releasing new titles in several of its franchises, including Call of Duty, Guitar Hero, and Tony Hawk. But analysts were less optimistic about Electronic Arts’ release schedule. Mild enthusiasm for forthcoming titles such as Dragon Age Origins and Dante’s Inferno sent shares in EA tumbling in late trading on Wednesday.
168;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-07-12T20:04:30Z;Vivendi chief aiming to secure best Zain deal;;If Vivendi succeeds in buying a controlling stake in Zain Africa, Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive of the French entertainment and telecommunications group, will become known as one of France’s most prolific dealmakers.The French group confirmed last week that it was in talks to buy a majority stake in Zain’s African operations which it values at $10bn-$11bn in their entirety, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr Lévy cannot match his predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, for audacity. Indeed, the taciturn former telecoms engineer is anxious to avoid any parallels with Mr Messier, who took Vivendi to the brink of bankruptcy with a series of vast acquisitions. The company said it “attaches the utmost importance” to keeping its triple B credit rating and current dividend despite the deal.Nevertheless, the purchase of the African operations of the Kuwaiti telecoms group would be Mr Lévy’s fifth large acquisition in less than four years, starting with TPS, the satellite broadcaster in 2005, Bertelsmann Music Group in 2006, the merger of Vivendi’s Blizzard games division with Activision in 2007 and then full ownership of Neuf Cegetel, the internet service provider, through SFR, the mobile operator in which Vivendi has a 56 per cent stake.Analysts say the purchase of Zain Africa makes good strategic sense giving Vivendi wider exposure to fast-growing markets at a time when its domestic telecoms and pay-TV businesses are facing stronger competition and its record business is in decline. Zain’s operations span 15 countries with a population of 450m where the average mobile penetration rate is only 34 per cent.Vivendi can also draw on the expertise of Maroc Telecom, in which it has a 53 per cent stake. The highly profitable North African group has established operations in Burkina Faso, Gabon, Mauritania and Mali.But the deal carries risks, not least the complexity of running operations in so many different markets and in Anglophone Africa, especially Nigeria, where Maroc Telecom has little experience.Mr Lévy’s track record of walking away from deals he regards as too expensive has also provided some reassurance to analysts that the company will not over-pay.Vivendi also has various options for financing a deal. Standard & Poor’s said Vivendi “has some headroom” in its rating given a consolidated debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) ratio of 1.8 at the end of March. It also has assets, most notably a 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal, the US broadcaster and studio, but a disposal at this stage seems unlikely.The French group is reportedly interested in a bridging loan to tide it over, but a small capital raising may still be required.Alternatively, Vivendi could use Maroc Telecom, which has net cash, as a vehicle for a takeover, but this would complicate the corporate governance.If it is clear why Vivendi is looking to buy, it is not so obvious why Zain is prepared to sell. Dr Saad al Barrak, Zain’s chief executive, told the Financial Times last week that management felt obliged to alert the Kuwaiti telecoms group’s shareholders to the approach by Vivendi.Zain bought its African mobile phone businesses, previously known as Celtel, just four years ago for $3.4bn. Explaining why it was willing to consider a sale of at least a majority stake Dr Barrak said: “If we are approached by big players with clear value creation we have to pass this to our shareholders. This is not a decision for us on the management level. It is all up to the shareholders to decide.”Dr Barrak said Zain had received tentative interest in its African assets from several international companies, but declined to identify them. He added that only Vivendi had made an informal offer for the assets.
169;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-07-01T03:00:51Z;Jackson sales surge outstrips Presley;;A surge in interest in Michael Jackson is forcing people around him to revise their initial assessment that his assets could be overwhelmed by the debts attached to them.Amazon.com, the online retailer, sold as many Jackson albums in the 24 hours after his death as in the previous 11 years, and HMV’s music stores saw an 80-fold jump in sales of his recordings.The response has overwhelmed sales increases seen after Elvis Presley and John Lennon died, HMV said. The fact that much of the music is being sold online also means profit margins should be high.In spite of dying with debts of between $400m and $500m, the value of many of Jackson’s other assets has been similarly transformed by his death, according to industry executives, lawyers and former advisers.They warned, however, that the experience of other performer’s estates indicated that future earnings would depend on decisions taken in the coming weeks by his family and business partners.Control of Jackson’s estate remains unclear, with one report that he died with no valid will conflicting with others that John Branca, a former attorney who returned to his staff recently, has a 2002 will leaving assets to Jackson’s children, his mother and some charities.“You’ve got to appoint someone who’s in charge of this – a trustee,” said J Duross O’Bryan, a forensic accountant and managing director of AlixPartners who examined Jackson’s finances during a 2005 molestation trial. At the time, Jackson had “little or no cash at all, from the documents we saw”, Mr O’Bryan said. The Associated Press reported that a 2007 statement of his financial condition found he had just $668,000 in cash.“He’d overspent so badly at that point that he had gotten a number of advances [against future sales] from Sony,” his partner in the Sony ATV music publishing venture which owns most of the Beatles’ biggest hits, Mr O’Bryan said.A Sony ATV spokesman would not comment.Industry executives said that the 50 per cent stake, valued at up to $1bn, should still be worth more than a $300m loan from Barclays secured against it.Jackson’s next largest asset, the Mijac catalogue that controls publishing rights to his recordings, will see the most direct benefit from his return to the top of the charts. If Mijac is auctioned, as some executives expect, its value should easily exceed the $73m Barclays loan secured on it.According to one executive who has heard them, Jackson had also been working on an album with a producer called RedOne, raising the prospect of revenues from new songs.Anschutz Entertainment Group, which had planned Jackson’s 50 nights of concerts at ­London’s O2 Arena, confirmed that it could release lucrative video footage of the rehearsals.Randy Philips, AEG Live’s president, told Sky News a family tribute show could replace some of the planned concerts, adding: “We probably will be fine financially from this.”Jackson’s death has also transformed the potential fortunes of Neverland, the 2,600-acre Santa Barbara ranch that had been one of the heaviest drains on his cash. Before moving out in 2006, he maintained about 50 cars and more than 100 staff on the property. Colony Capital, which saved Neverland from a foreclosure sale last year via a joint venture with Jackson to spruce up the property, has not commented on its plans. Industry lawyers said, however, that it may follow the model of Elvis Presley’s estate.Presley died in similarly straitened circumstances, but his family’s agreement to open his Graceland home to the public and keep a tight rein on the use of his image turned the value of the estate round.CKX, which owns 85 per cent of ­Presley’s estate, ­generated operating income before depreciation, amortisation and charges of $16.7m (€12m, £10m) from the asset last year, on revenue of $54.9m.Tom Barrack, Colony’s chief executive, said before Jackson’s death that the value of Neverland could be between $70m and $90m. In a statement on its website on Friday, before Tuesday’s news that the singer’s body would be driven there on Thursday, he acknowledged the growing public interest in the site.“Neverland itself is now a mythical sanctuary to Michael and we are doing our best to accommodate the throngs of global press and fans arriving there to express their grief,” he said.Doing so may be impossible without co-operation from Jackson’s heirs, people who have worked with the family said, adding that they expected several claimants to his fortune to emerge.“There is definitely real money to fight over,” one industry executive cautioned, “but when you fight over real money, the real money tends to disappear and the debts remain.”
170;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-05-17T21:05:12Z;Ubisoft plans push into film special effects;;Yves Guillemot has his sights set on Hollywood. The chief executive of Ubisoft wants to make the world’s third-largest video games company into a special effects powerhouse that can work closely with the film industry.The two industries have long been courting each other. Games such as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Streetfighter and Mortal Kombat have all made it to the big screen, and hundreds of films have inspired games, such as King Kong, Spider-Man and Lord of The Rings.Yet licences crossing in either direction between celluloid and consoles have not always been commercial or critical successes.Lately, however, media companies have been taking a greater interest in games, particularly since Vivendi merged its Blizzard games unit with Activision in 2007. Time Warner has invested in several studios while Viacom owns Harmonix, developer of the Rock Band and Guitar Hero games.Mr Guillemot is approaching the game-movie marriage from the other side. With the value of the games market now outstripping Hollywood, Ubisoft wants to work with studios on a more equal footing. “We can enrich movies and they can enrich games.”Last year, the Paris-based company bought Hybride, a Canadian special effects company, which has worked on films such as Sin City and 300. The aim was to use Hybride’s technology to make more film-like video games, and to work more closely with studios when making games based on film titles and vice-versa.“We want to create the capacity to develop special effects for movies. Those worlds have to merge more and more,” he said. “We don’t want to make movies, but the expertise we have is key to creating special effects, graphics and animation.”Avatar, a Twentieth Century Fox science-fiction film directed by James Cameron may be the first test of this approach. Ubisoft is creating a game based on the film, working closely with the Fox team, sharing the development of the photorealistic 3D fantasy scenes and characters.“It is the first time we have been that close to a film studio. We have access to all their data as they create the game and they have access to ours,” Mr Guillemot says. Ubisoft previously worked closely with director Peter Jackson on the game of his remake of King Kong.With special effects making up a third or even half of some Hollywood budgets, Mr Guillemot believes Ubisoft could have a lot to offer the studios.“There are all the synergies of content creation, and the advantage of launching a game and movie at the same time, so that all your marketing works together,” he says. However, he is wary of studios wanting to invest in the company in return for collaboration, preferring to remain independent.As computer games technology increasingly blends with other types of entertainment, Mr Guillemot says it is important for countries to do more to safeguard their games industries, and so futureproof their creative economies.France and the UK have seen a brain drain in the sector as many developers have been tempted to move to countries such as Canada, where the state offers generous subsidies.“The industry has a know-how that countries need. Investing in it, giving subsidies, is not just an investment in games but in what is going to happen in all forms of entertainment and sports,” Mr Guillemot says.“Countries like Canada and Singapore consider this business very important for their future.”
171;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-05-07T21:02:39Z;Activision Blizzard conquers expectations;;Activision Blizzard, the leading video game publisher, reported quarterly revenues and profits well ahead of expectations as its Guitar Hero, Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises helped it ride out the downturn.However, the Santa Monica-based company was conservative in raising its forecast for the year, citing continuing economic uncertainty.Activision Blizzard reported sales of $724m in its first quarter, compared to its prior outlook of $550m on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes certain items such as deferred costs and sales for its online games. Earnings per share were 8 cents - 5 cents higher than previously forecast.The company said there had been ”strong global consumer response” to its top three franchises ”despite challenging economic times.”Its Guitar Hero World Tour was the top selling third-party title - excluding Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft first-party titles - in the US, while sales of Guitar Hero in Europe were up 84 per cent year-on-year, according to video game research firms.The publisher acquired 7 Studios last month to broaden its development capabilities in the music genre and plans several new releases this year, including Guitar Hero V, Band Hero and DJ Hero, which will focus on club music.”We are now covering the broadest swathe of audience, the broadest geographies and with entry points at all price points and in all categories in music,” said Bobby Kotick, chief executive, in a Financial Times interview.His company’s performance was in contrast to its closest rival, Electronic Arts, which markets the Rock Band game and reported a quarterly loss of 37 cents a share this week. EA complained of softness in the music category, reporting it was down 36 per cent in the first quarter.Activision Blizzard raised its outlook for the calendar year to non-GAAP sales of $4.8bn, from $4.7bn and earnings per share of 63 cents, up from 61 cents.”While we have a lot of confidence in our slate, there’s still a lot of macroeconomic uncertainty, and our general strategy is always to be fairly cautious about the outlook,” said Mr Kotick.Earlier in the day, Nintendo had forecast flat sales and falling profits this year, but Mr Kotick, whose company is the leading third-party publisher on the platform, said he saw the Wii console continuing to have strength in the US and European markets.
172;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-04-09T21:34:57Z;Coming soon…Accordion Hero, Flugelhorn Hero…?;;The creators of Guitar Hero, the video game that transforms console players into plastic-guitar-wielding maniacs, have big plans to extend the brand.Speaking at the MI6 game marketing conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Kai Huang, co-founder with his brother Charles of RedOctane, the Guitar Hero publisher, said he believed the industry was in the early stages of developing a huge category around music.He described a graph with music genres on one axis and musical instruments on the other.“The current games Guitar Hero and Rock Band really just focus on rock music, so we have one genre of music with a guitar as the instrument,” he said.Drums and microphone had been added, but the next stage was to move into other genres and their instruments. To that end, RedOctane’s parent, Activision Blizzard, will release DJ Hero for the hip-hop genre at the end of this year.“When we launched in 2005, rock music was actually on the decline, but what made it special was the experience – it made you feel like a rock star,” said Mr Huang.The same feeling could be experienced in other genres and hook new audiences – more than 50 per cent interested in DJ Hero in market research had never bought a music game before, he revealed.“When my brother and I first launched Guitar Hero, Accordion Hero was one of the first jokes that came out on the internet. Now our joke to each other is that we could say: ‘You think you didn’t like accordion music but we’re going to create an experience and when you get your hands on it, you’re going to say: ‘Holy Cow! Accordion music is fantastic and I want to learn more about this.””If they ever get serious, Mexico’s Ramon Ayala, the “accordion king”, could be looking at a major boost to his career.
173;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-03-27T18:17:55Z;Eidos approves takeover by Square Enix;;UK investors will soon bid farewell to the last London-listed video games company after Eidos, the creator of Lara Croft, approved a takeover by Square Enix, a larger Japanese rival.Long-suffering shareholders in Eidos approved a 32p a share bid with only a minority of small private investors voting against. The deal values the Tomb Raider developer at £84.3m.The company, which was created from a combination of Eidos and SCi Entertainment in 2005, raised £60m in a fundraising less than a year ago at 35p a share.The vote appears to dash any remaining hopes of a rival bid from Time Warner, a 20 per cent shareholder in Eidos.The acquisition will be completed through a scheme of arrangement, with Eidos shares due to be suspended on April 21, with cancellation on May 6.Despite the rapid fall in the company’s share price in the past two years, Phil Rogers, Eidos chief executive, said: “This is good for our shareholders as it gives them the certainty that many have welcomed.”He said it would take the company to a “new level”.Eidos warned in January that it could face a funding shortfall after sales of the latest Tomb Raider game disappointed over Christmas. It then expected sales of £160m to £180m this year. This month it revealed that the release of Championship Manager, another flagship title, would be delayed, citing quality concerns.Eidos was originally acquired by SCi, a smaller games company, in 2005. Eidos was effectively forced to put itself up for sale in 2004 when it found itself too small to compete with bigger global operators such as Electronic Arts and Activision. SCi changed its name back to Eidos last year.Jane Cavanagh and Bill Ennis, SCi’s founding management, were ousted in January last year after failing to agree a takeover bid and warning on profits. SCi’s shares were worth 386p when it announced bid talks in September 2007.Ms Cavanagh, who still holds a stake in Eidos of about 3 per cent, said: “Square Enix have got the deal of the century.”
174;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-03-23T07:05:56Z;Zeebo takes aim at emerging markets;;A games console powered by mobile phone parts and aimed at emerging markets will be launched on Monday.The Zeebo console is being unveiled at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, targeting developers and publishers that would like to expand in new markets without fear of piracy.For consumers in Brazil, where it will be sold initially, Zeebo offers affordable and instant access to popular video games through downloads over a free, secure, 3G wireless connection.“Instead of the consumer having to take a bus and go to a favela [shanty town] to buy pirated software, they can sit on their couch, turn on the Zeebo console and buy directly from home,” said John Rizzo, Zeebo’s chief executive.His San Diego-based company is backed by Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips and supplier of the processor, graphics, software and 3G connection in the console.Qualcomm says it is moving beyond the phone, with its chips and software now capable of powering netbooks and new kinds of consumer electronics devices.“The Amazon Kindle is a good example – an electronic book reader where giving it wireless connectivity has added this magic sauce where people buy books and they just appear on the device,” said Mike Yuen, senior director of games and services at Qualcomm.The largest console makers – Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo – and major publishers have generally shunned emerging markets, with profits hard to come by because of rampant piracy and consumers having less disposable income.The latest consoles cost about $1,000 in Brazil on the grey market, while an older PlayStation 2 sells for $250 and needs a $50 modification to run pirated software. The Zeebo console will cost $200 with four pre-installed games and the company will sell further titles for about $12 each, slightly more than the $10 paid on average for illegal titles.The business model has already won backing from leading publishers including Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts. The latter is offering popular titles Need for Speed Carbon and FIFA 09, featuring a Portuguese voiceover, at launch.Zeebo plans to launch in Brazil in May, in Mexico in the third quarter, India and Russia in 2010 and China in 2011.“The barrier to entry has been income, not broadband – cell phones have penetrated all these markets,” said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities.“This is a very substantial unexploited niche that could ultimately have 200m-300m addressable households, if not more.”
175;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-03-04T22:28:57Z;Activision;;"Collecting points in a computer game serves little purpose other than bragging rights over other players. Yet big tech companies often behave the same way, building up large piles of cash in the name of flexibility. However, Activision – the world’s largest publisher of computer games since merging with Blizzard Entertainment last year in a deal that gave French media conglomerate Vivendi 54 per cent of the company – may be tempted to use the $3bn of cash lying idle on its balance sheet. Successful integration of Blizzard has boosted management credibility with investors, while the credit crunch has helpfully lowered valuations for potential targets.Who might be in the gunsights? Activision’s recent success has been built on the Guitar Hero franchise (with over $1bn in sales worldwide), and Call of Duty, a soldiering shoot ’em up. So the sporting games of Take Two might round out its portfolio. With Take Two shares currently worth $500m, it would also be a finger in the eye of competitor Electronic Arts, which eventually withdrew a $2bn bid for the company last year.Yet profitable and growing Activision has typically pursued a strategy of buying small studios or intellectual property. Indeed the rights to Guitar Hero were picked up for a mere $100m. It has then concentrated on a narrow selection of big franchises, plus Blizzard’s World of Warcraft – which boasts 11.5m online users and means that half of group operating profit now comes from a stable subscription base. Lossmaking Electronic Arts, by comparison, has been a serial acquirer.So Activision should resist letting its cash burn a hole in its pocket. If it must spend, beyond the odd small, opportunistic bargain, then its own shares on a not unreasonable 16 times prospective earnings may be a better bet than empire building. It can always wait for peers to run out of lives.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

176;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-03-02T19:45:12Z;Vivendi;;"Yesterday’s basket case, today’s turnround story. Vivendi, the French media and telecoms conglomerate, was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy in 2002 after a spate of ill-advised acquisitions by its insatiable leader, Jean-Marie Messier. Today, under Jean-Bernard Lévy, the sprawling company has emerged as one of the media companies least exposed to the downturn.A drop in net profit masked a robust underlying performance as Vivendi reported its full-year results yesterday. While overall performance was hit by one-offs, including acquisition costs and a writedown on its stake in NBC Universal, Vivendi notched up a respectable 4.9 per cent jump in earnings before interest, tax, and amortisation. It also lifted its dividend 7.7 per cent.Vivendi’s relative strength is partly the result of decisions taken during emergency surgery by Mr Lévy’s predecessor, Jean-René Fourtou, who hived off media and entertainment assets to General Electric’s NBC in 2003 while retaining its interests in telecommunications and video games – two sectors that have so far proved reasonably resilient in the downturn.Since becoming chief executive in 2005, Mr Lévy has expanded Vivendi’s investment in both areas. In 2007, Vivendi purchased Activision, one of the world’s leading video games publishers. The addition of hit titles such as Guitar Hero and Call of Duty to its existing video game line-up gave Vivendi four of the industry’s top 10 selling titles last year.Vivendi’s shares trade on a forward price/earning multiple of just 7.6 – a discount to media peers. With Vivendi forecasting strong growth in adjusted earnings before interest and tax this year and committed to paying a dividend of at least 50 per cent of adjusted net earnings, this former laggard looks like a reasonably defensive bet.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

177;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-02-12T05:55:14Z;Activision bucks trend with record results;;Activision Blizzard, the largest video game publisher, reported recession-resistant results on Wednesday, with record revenues and profits, in sharp contrast to the fortunes of rivals.However, its shares fell as much as 9 per cent in after-hours trading to $8.60 as forecasts for its March quarter of $550m in sales fell short of analyst expectations of $628m. The publisher of best-selling franchises Call of Duty, Guitar Hero and World of Warcraft said it had surpassed profits and sales targets a year ahead of plan for the merger of Activision and Vivendi’s games division, which was completed last July.For the busy December quarter, it reported $2.3bn in revenues and a profit of $429m or 31 cents a share on a non-GAAP basis. It exceeded $5bn in revenues for 2008, after forecasting that it would achieve $4.3bn in revenues only in 2009.Bobby Kotick, chief executive, told the Financial Times that Activision was forecasting revenue growth and margin expansion this year on a constant currency basis. “The market is growing for people who have the very highest quality, most-appealing properties and products and, in our case, we have a collection of franchises that are the most in demand,” he said.Electronic Arts, Activision’s closest rival, reported December quarter results below its expectations, significantly reduced its outlook and announced 1,100 jobs cuts – 11 per cent of its workforce. THQ also disappointed with its results and said it was cutting almost a quarter of its workforce.Software unit sales grew 15 per cent in the US last year, according to the NPD research firm, as the industry appeared to be a stand-out in bucking the recession. But Nintendo, helped by in-house titles for its best-selling Wii and DS consoles, and Activision Blizzard have been the chief beneficiaries.Mr Kotick said the company had no plans to make large cuts like its rivals. “We’re fortunate that all of the merger restructuring and right-sizing of the business is behind us,” he said.
178;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2009-02-05T00:07:20Z;Game sales benefit army of two;;To borrow an EA game title, it feels as if there is an Army of Two, or perhaps three, benefiting from booming video game software sales.That best sums up the paradox of strong industry sales but disappointing revenues and losses for individual publishers.Electronic Arts gave us its bad news on Tuesday, including 1,100 job losses as it cut its costs to match its reduced ambitions.On Wednesday, it was the turn of its smaller rival THQ, announcing savage cost-cutting after its holiday quarter disappointed.Like EA, THQ said it had produced high-quality games that had not found sufficient audiences as consumers focused on blockbuster titles.It reported a loss of 14 cents a share when analysts had expected a profit of 7 cents. Revenues were $357m compared to the $402m expected by Wall Street.THQ shares fell 15 per cent after-hours to $3.50, down from a 52-week high of $23.40 last April.The company, whose hits include Saints Row and SpongeBob Squarepants, is responding by reducing planned spending by $220m in its next fiscal year and cutting 600 jobs – almost a quarter of its workforce.The Army of Two then is Nintendo, which has dominated software sales on its leading Wii console, and Activision Blizzard, which cleaned up at Christmas with the latest in its Call of Duty series and Guitar Hero games. It will release December quarter results next Wednesday.Microsoft has also fared well with its homegrown titles for its Xbox console, such as Gears of War 2.NPD, GfK and Enterbrain reported this week that software unit sales in the US, UK and Japan grew by 15 per cent, 26 per cent and minus 13 per cent in 2008 for a combined total of 410m units and an average 11 per cent rise.Nintendo had three of the top five titles in Mario Kart, Wii Fit and Super Smash Bros: Brawl, with Take-Two’s Grand Theft Auto IV and Activision’s Call of Duty: World at War occupying the other two places.
179;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;EA cuts games business to the core;;"Electronic Arts chief executive John Riccitiello, a keen gamer, must have that stuck-on-the-same-level feeling after the video game publisher’s latest results.He returned to EA in April 2007 with the task of improving an underperforming giant of the industry.Instead, the company has continued to lose its lustre as a hit factory and has also lost its position as number one, due to the merger of Activision and Vivendi’s games division.The CEO has succeeded in improving the quality of existing franchises and has introduced innovative new titles.But EA lacked blockbuster hits in the holiday season and some of its games were shunned by retailers – consumers were confining their spending to top-ten hits and games for the Wii, where EA has been under-represented by its standards.This all added up to flat sales in the December quarter , reported on Tuesday, when the industry as a whole saw North American game sales rise 15 per cent. EA reported a $641m loss, which included a $368m writedown of its investment in its wireless business.EA has always had a reputation as a big spender that has pursued every platform for its games, but that is about to change.
Mr Riccitiello said he was cutting half a billion dollars from previous expectations for operating expenditure in the next financial year beginning in April, with the aim of reducing it to $2.1bn.That would be achieved with the help of a 14 per cent cut in versions of its games, the closure of 12 facilities and a cut of 11 per cent – or 1,100 people – in its workforce.The Sims 3, a much anticipated game due later this month has been pushed out to June and other significant titles, Godfather 2 and Dragon Age are also being delayed until the next fiscal year.EA will concentrate on core titles and redouble its efforts on the Wii platform, where games such as its Playground and Boogie were poorly received.The giant appears humbled – Mr Riccitiello said its marketing department would spend more time wooing consumers – but getting its costs under control is an important first step in any recovery, and moving on to that next level."
180;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-12-24T22:20:24Z;A cacophonous console Christmas;;The usual rattle of gunfire and thunder of explosions in our living room has been replaced this Christmas by the even more frightening sounds of prolonged wailing and crashing mis-plucked guitar chords.Yes, in looking back at this season’s best video games, and playing them, music seems to have been a big winner.Guitar Hero is becoming a perennial best-seller and its World Tour version adds a microphone and drums to make it a battle of the bands with the rival Rock Band game.It is very addictive, I never thought of myself as much of an air guitarist but am determined to nail The Killers’ When You Were Young before Christmas is out.Other musical titles getting plenty of play in our house are Sony’s Singstar on the PlayStation 3 – the karaoke game now has an Abba edition, and Lips, the rival karaoke title brought out by Microsoft for the Xbox this year.Microsoft’s wireless microphones give it the hardware edge, but Sony perhaps has the better song selection at the moment and is coming out with its own wireless mikes in the new year.Wii Music has not got much play from us and sales seem to have been disappointing so far for Nintendo, with its older Wii Fit title way ahead of Music in the bestseller list. Perhaps Music needs more musical accessories and other titles to take off , but making your own music does not seem as compelling as hamming up existing pop tunes.Murder and mayhem games still seem just as popular. Sony’s Resistance 2 has come up against Microsoft’s Gears of War 2 this holiday season and there is the cross-platfrom Call of Duty: World at War from Activision Blizzard.However, we have had the most fun fighting zombies in Left 4 Dead and this has to be a contender for action game of the year alongside earlier releases Grand Theft Auto IV and Fallout 3.Other games worthy of note are EA’s Mirror’s Edge, an exciting pursuit across rooftops, and MotorStorm: Pacific Rift for the PS3 is the most fun we’ve had behind a steering wheel lately (Mario Kart on the Wii is recommended too.)For game of the year, a clear winner with us is Sony’s LittleBigPlanet for its all-round appeal, the creativity it brings out in players designing their own levels and for the character Sackboy, a Mario for the modern age.
181;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-12-11T22:39:39Z;Little Sony Big Nintendo Planet;;There are still 13 more shopping days until Christmas, but the video game winners and losers at US retail this season are already clear.Take a bow Nintendo, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. Start making your excuses now Sony and Electronic Arts.EA, which lost its position as the industry’s biggest third-party publisher this year with the merger of Activision Blizzard, did get in ahead of today’s NPD figures for November with a profit and sales warning earlier this week.Its inability lately to produce best-selling games has left it with retailers reluctant to restock some of its titles. Its only Top Ten title in the November figures is eighth-placed Left 4 Dead, the zombie game it is publishing on behalf of the independent developer Valve.Sony has buried the unimpressive figures for sales of its PlayStation 3 with the launch of its much-delayed Home virtual world today.The NPD numbers show the PS3 selling 378,000 units last month, almost double its October figure as holiday season sales ramped up. However, sales are down nearly 20 per cent on a year ago, when 466,000 were sold.In contrast, sales of the Wii have more than doubled year-on-year, from 981,000 to 2.04m, with supplies plentiful in contrast to 2007′s shortages. Xbox 360 sales rose from 770,000 to 836,000.In software, Microsoft’s Gears of War 2 was the number-one game, selling 1.56m copies – four times as many as Sony’s same-genre Resistance 2 in ninth place.Nintendo held four positions in the Top Ten with Wii Play, Wii Fit, Wii Music and Mario Kart. Activision Blizzard took the other three positions with two versions of Call of Duty: World at War and Guitar Hero World Tour. Its new World of Warcraft expansion pack for the PC – Wrath of the Lich King – sold more than 1.4m copies in the US.The figures bear out the continuing trend that the video game sector is alone in bucking the recession at retail. The big winners have been determined by consumer preference for cheaper consoles – the Xbox starting at $199 and the Wii at $250 – and an intensified focus by the buying public on the big hits.NPD says total sales were 10 per cent higher than last November, even with seven fewer days of post-Thanksgiving shopping. It says the industry is on course for $22bn in sales this year – a 22 per cent rise on 2007′s $18bn and a rare ray of sunlight for retail overall.
182;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
183;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-11-05T22:26:41Z;A quantum of consolidation in video games;;Video game publishers are often criticised for a lack of imagination in concentrating on blockbuster sequels, but it seems that’s about all gamers are prepared to pay for in these recessionary times.Electronic Arts cut jobs and its forecasts last week as it reported that consumers were concentrating on its frontline titles and neglecting middle-tier ones and older catalogue games.Today, THQ announced a major restructuring, with cancelled titles, five studio closures and 250 job losses – about 17 per cent of its workforce. It said it was now focused on producing a core number of high quality games.Brian Farrell, chief executive, reported softness in sales of catalogue titles and a cautious retail environment. The kids licence business – THQ makes titles based on Nickelodeon cartoons and Disney Pixar movies – had slowed considerably and become less profitable, he said.Activision Blizzard, now the biggest player in the sector since the merger with Vivendi’s games division, seems in the best position.It has its biggest ever slate of AAA titles for the holiday season, it said today, including World of Warcraft’s Wrath of the Lich King, two Guitar Hero titles, Call of Duty: World at War and a title based on the James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace.Even so, there was a quantum of reserve in the remarks of chief executive, Bobby Kotick.“We remain cautious given the likely slowdown in consumer spending this holiday season,” he said, adding “This is the most uncertainty that we have ever experienced.”
184;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-10-29T23:11:09Z;Beatles come together with Rock Band;;Beatles music will be used in the popular Rock Band video game, marking the first big digital foray by the Fab Four, according to people familiar with the plans.Viacom’s MTV Networks, which owns the game, and Apple Corps, the company established by the Beatles to oversee their business interests, were expected to reveal the deal as part of a broader “global music project”.The parties planned to announce the project on Thursday, according to an invitation sent by e-mail. Among those scheduled to attend were Apple Corps chief Jeff Jones, MTV Networks chairman Judy McGrath and MTV Networks president Van Toffler.Financial terms of the deal were not immediately available. A deal would also require the approval of EMI Music, which owns the master recordings, and Sony/ATV, which owns the copyrights.The Financial Times reported in June that Beatles representative were in discussions with two companies – Activision, which publishes Guitar Hero, and MTV Games, which owns the Rock Band franchise - to create a Beatles-themed video game.Surviving members of the band have been cautious in licensing their works and have rarely made their songs available digitally, but have dabbled in offering streams of an album on Beatles.com and have run trailers on YouTube. The Beatles have not made their songs available on Apple’s popular iTunes digital entertaiment storefront.Apple Corps has become more active in recent months since Jeff Jones took over as chief executive. The company, whose board includes Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison and Yoko Ono Lennon, has allowed Beatles compositions to be used on the American Idol television series and in a Las Vegas show.Representatives of MTV Networks and EMI declined to comment. A representative of Apple Corps could not be reached for comment.For MTV Networks, which acquired video game developer Harmonix in 2006, Rock Band has turned into a surprise hit. It has sold 3.5m copies by the end of the second quarter this year. The game is distributed by publisher Electronic Arts.Signing up Apple Corps is the latest salvo against rival Activision Blizzard, whose Guitar Hero was also developed by Harmonix before MTV’s purchase.Taking a victory lap after closing a deal to merge Activision with Vivendi’s Blizzard Entertainment at the annual media and technology mogul get-together this summer, Activision Blizzard’s chief executive, Robert Kotick, told reporters the company was considering developing a digital storefront for music through its video game franchise.
185;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-09-16T21:53:30Z;Chief’s pride as game goes down a storm;;"When Jean-Bernard Lévy comes across his teenage son playing World of Warcraft on his computer late at night, he experiences a different emotion from most fathers: pride.For the role-playing computer game lies at the heart of Vivendi’s new world of pre-eminence in a lucrative market and Mr Lévy is understandably satisfied with the part he has played in that.“The games story is just amazing,” says the 53-year-old chief executive of Europe’s biggest entertainment company.“When I was chief operating officer in 2003, my first duty was really selling assets. So I put [Vivendi’s games division, including Blizzard] up for sale and I couldn’t sell it for $500m.”With the pleasurable air of one enumerating slain foes on the battlefield of a virtual world, he runs through the growth story since he decided to keep the business, reform it and increase its scope.During negotiations last year to buy 54 per cent of Activision, Blizzard was valued at €2bn ($2.8bn) and Vivendi added another €1bn in cash.He says: “Today the market cap of Activision Blizzard is $22bn. We have 54 per cent. If you translate it into euros it’s a little above €8bn.“That’s a good story, isn’t it? 500 becoming 2, and then 2 plus 1 becoming 8? That’s the video games business.”The burgeoning success of Activision Blizzard, now the largest games company in the world, is one reason for Mr Lévy’s contentment.Music is another, with Universal also sitting on top of the world market. Vivendi’s other businesses are all making contributions: Groupe Canal+, the film and television company; 56 per cent of SFR, the number two mobile operator in France, which has just taken over Neuf Cegetel, the number two fixed-line company; and 53 per cent of fast-growing Maroc Telecom, the leading fixed and mobile company in Morocco.So much so, he says, that Vivendi is not preoccupied with expansion.Asked whether he will join in the current auction of Digital Plus, the satellite arm of Sogecable, the Spanish broadcaster, he raises his hand emphatically.“I just want to say that we have a lot of financial discipline and that we are not today focusing the company so much on acquisitions, but much more on the integration of the businesses we’ve recently acquired.”But whereas he rules out investing in Premiere, the German pay-TV group, he does not rule out a bid for Digital Plus, estimated to be worth €3bn, a move that would see him in contest with Spain’s Telefónica, Mediaset of Italy and British Sky Broadcasting, among others.However, it seems Vivendi, if it is to open its chequebook again, may be more interested in telecoms companies in emerging markets.He repeats his desire to buy out Vodafone, his partner in SFR. But in spite of the recent appointment of Vittorio Colao as chief executive there, Mr Lévy says he sees “no sign of any change” in Vodafone’s refusal to sell.He says he regards Mr Colao as a “very good partner” in the business, a contrast to the way in which he speaks about their main rival, Orange, owned by France Telecom.It has recently stepped up competition with Vivendi on several other fronts, including a decision to spend heavily on content, including some football rights, for a network of television channels that will be a competitor to the main Canal+ network.“I do say very politely, that we consider that the movement of Orange against Canal Plus is not a rational one.“Some things in life are not always rational. But, very politely, we are obliged to say we do not see that it is rational for Orange to be trying to displace Canal Plus, creating a lot of confusion, buying rights, especially foreign rights – foreign as seen from France – at a very high cost with benefit to nobody.”Thoughts of the competition prompt him to state his view that the former state monopoly still has a strong position in the French industry, making it hard for SFR Neuf Cegetel to compete.“I believe the regulation that has been put in place and the way it has been applied . . . has been very lenient . . . towards France Telecom and has failed sufficiently to encourage alternative operators.”It is clear to Mr Lévy that, in the business world of warcraft where Vivendi operates, there are still many battles to be won."
186;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-09-15T18:41:52Z;Car theft gamemaker falls as EA ends pursuit;;Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto video game series, lost almost a quarter of its value on Monday after rival Electronic Arts ended its seven-month pursuit of the company.EA said on Sunday it had abandoned talks over a deal and would not continue with its bid.Take-Two shares fell 24 per cent in New York to $16.57.Analysts lowered their target prices for Take-Two and suggested it had made a strategic error in the talks.Standard & Poor’s analysts, referring to the performance of the Grand Theft Auto IV game, said: “We believe negotiations became more difficult after Take-Two was unwilling to budge on its position after it exceeded expectations in its most recent quarterly results.“We think that Electronic Arts will be hurt by not having Take-Two’s Grand Theft Auto nor being the market leader in the video game industry following the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games to form Activision Blizzard.”Citigroup analysts said that, while a deal was dead for now, they believed EA would return at a later date. Take-Two was a good strategic fit, with sports franchises needed by EA and was being run by a turnround team who saw an acquisition as an exit strategy, they said.In an interview with the Financial Times, Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two chairman, said it was EA who had refused to budge in not raising its offer.He said: “They approached us and they stayed at a price and they never budged, in fact they reduced it. That’s not typically the way deals get done”.He said EA continued to be in discussions with other parties regarding its process to consider strategic alternatives, but said he was not in a position to name possible suitors.EA, the publisher of titles such as the Madden NFL football game and The Sims, had been fighting to acquire Take-Two since February, when it offered to pay up to $26 per share, or about $2bn.The companies started formal talks over a deal last month, after EA allowed to expire an unsolicited tender offer it had made to buy Take-Two at the slightly lower price of $25.74.The Federal Trade Commission ruled in August that it would not oppose a deal between the two companies, a move some analysts had felt was the main obstacle to a takeover.EA said on Sunday that after reviewing Take-Two’s financial materials and hearing presentations from management, it had “decided not to make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions”.
187;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-09-14T22:54:04Z;Electronic Arts ends campaign to buy Take-Two;;Electronic Arts said on Sunday that it had abandoned talks over a deal to buy rival video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software and would not press forward with a bid, presumably ending its seven-month battle to acquire the company.EA, the publisher of the Madden American football game and Rock Band, has been fighting to acquire Take-Two since February, when its offered to pay up to $26 per share, or about $2bn (£1.1bn).The video game rivals started formal talks over a deal under a month ago, after EA agreed to let an unsolicited tender offer it had made to buy Take-Two at a slightly lower price expire.The Federal Trade Commission ruled in August that it would not oppose a deal between the two companies, a move some analysts had felt was the main obstacle to a takeover.EA said on Sunday, however, that after reviewing Take-Two’s financial materials and hearing presentations from management, it had “decided not to make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions”.Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s chairman, said in response that his company was still “actively engaged in discussions with other parties in the context of our formal process to consider strategic alternatives”. He said Take-Two’s business had strengthened since EA first made its unsolicited offer.Throughout the saga between the two companies, investors have tried to calculate whether EA would be willing to pay more than $26 per share – or whether a deal would close at all.Shares of Take-Two have traded below $26 since late June and had dropped below $22 in recent trading sessions. Shares in the publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series closed at $21.89 on Friday.The company has had a volatile 18 months. Shareholders ejected top management in early 2007 over lacklustre results and questions over graphic content in the company’s games. Several of its former senior executives were caught up in an accounting scandal.Its third-quarter results came in stronger than expected on heavy sales of Grand Theft Auto 4 but the company cut its outlook to reflect the delayed release of another game.Vivendi, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with Activision Blizzard, which was formed in July when Vivendi closed on a deal to meld Activision, Electronic Arts’ major competitor, into its own gaming business. Activision, which publishes the popular Guitar Hero video game franchise, announced last week that it would buy UK game developer FreeStyleGames.
188;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-08-29T17:10:18Z;Square Enix in friendly offer for Temco;;"Tecmo, a Japanese video games developer known for gratuitous gore and highly-sexualised female characters, has received a takeover bid from a larger rival as consolidation accelerates in the industry.Square Enix said on Friday it would make a friendly offer for at least 50 per cent of the company provided that Tecmo’s board accepted its offer by September 4. Tecmo replied that it was considering its response to the offer, which values its equity at Y21.7bn ($200m).If successful, the deal would unite Tecmo’s Dead or Alive fighting titles and Ninja Gaiden action adventures, with Square Enix’s Final Fantasy series of role-playing games. Tecmo’s franchises are popular in the US and Europe – an important attraction for Square Enix as it seeks to produce titles that will have broad appeal worldwide.The deal is the latest merger between companies struggling with the high cost of creating games for next-generation consoles such as Sony’s Playstation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360.France’s Vivendi recently merged its games business with Activision Blizzard of the US, while Electronic Arts is in talks to buy US rival Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, for about $2bn.Square Enix has struck at a difficult time for Tecmo. Tomonobu Itagaki – the company’s star developer, whose long hair, leather jacket and sunglasses are not the usual attire of a Japanese salaryman – quit Tecmo at the start of June. He then sued his former employer for alleged non­payment of a completion bonus for Dead or Alive 4. Tecmo denies that such a payment was due.Last week, Yoshimi Yasuda, Tecmo’s president, announced he would step down for personal reasons on the day of the company’s interim results presentation.It was Mr Yasuda’s resignation that prompted Square Enix, which had been talking to Tecmo about a deal since May, to make the unusual move of making public its friendly offer before Tecmo’s acceptance. “We were worried about what would happen to our discussions,” said Yoichi Wada, president of Square Enix.Square Enix is offering Tecmo Y920 a share, a premium of 30 per cent to Tecmo’s share price before the bid was announced. That is equivalent to 22 times Tecmo’s own earnings forecast for 2008. Analysts said the deal was not expensive, because Tecmo has Y11.5bn in cash on its balance sheet.“Square [would only be] paying Y12bn in net cash for a business with Y2.5bn in annual operating profit,” said Pelham Smithers, an analyst at brokerage Pali International.Tecmo shares rose by their daily trading limit of 14 per cent to close at Y806; Square Enix shares added 2.6 per cent to Y3,610."
189;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-08-15T00:16:13Z;Warner chief slammed in ‘Guitar Hero’ row;;The chief executive of the company behind the Guitar Hero video game franchise has hit out at Warner Music after the label said higher royalties should be paid for use of its songs.In a sign of increasing tensions between the two companies, Robert Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said Warner Music had failed to acknowledge the benefits to music sales from Guitar Hero. The game has sold close to 20m units and generated $1bn in revenues but has also boosted sales of the artists it features.Mr Kotick told the Financial Times that Edgar Bronfman, Warner Music’s chief executive, had made “one-sided comments” that were not “respectful of how much we’ve done to bring new audiences into the market”.Mr Bronfman said last week that the amount being paid to the music industry from music-based games was “far too small”. But Mr Kotick said Activison had to invest “capital and resources” in its games to make the songs “fun to play”.“I think his view was …that [Warner Music] should be compensated the way they might for a performance on iTunes,” said Mr Kotick. “But this is an entirely different business that is very technically complex. We’re going to favour those publishers that recognise and appreciate how much we can add value to their artists.”Activision recently merged with Vivendi’s games unit. Vivendi owns Universal Music, the world’s largest music publisher.Mr Kotick said there was a direct link between artists featured in Guitar Hero and sales of their music. “We’re introducing a whole new group of artists to new audiences that is resulting in their iTunes downloads being exponentially higher than they would otherwise be, [as well as] new album sales and new merchandising opportunities.”Guitar Hero has spawned two sequels and an Aerosmith spin-off but Mr Kotick also revealed a desire to see the music of Led Zeppelin added to the game. “Their music would really appeal to this new generation,” he said.Activision moved from Silicon Valley to Santa Monica several years ago with the aim of tapping into Hollywood’s creative talent. Mr Kotick said he expected future video games to take on “some of the characteristics of linear media …the production values will get higher, the storylines will become more important”.A Warner Music spokesman said the company had “enormous respect” for the investment and creativity game-publishers had brought to the music-gaming business.He added: “We hope that our partners in the gaming space appreciate not only the value of their own contributions but also those of the recording artists, songwriters, record labels and music publishers on which their games are significantly based.”Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliff-Johnson
190;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-07-21T22:05:33Z;Icahn calls truce in Yahoo battle;;The battle for Yahoo ended in a truce on Monday, with the direction of the company still likely to be a source of future conflict.The Yahoo board said it would welcome as a member Carl Icahn, a man it had described as a misguided, flip-flopping “short-term agitator”, who knew next to nothing about technology.For his part, Mr Icahn said he believed he could have “a strong working relationship” with a board he had described as acting irrationally and irresponsibly and making a “completely botched” job of its negotiations for a sale to Microsoft.More a shotgun marriage than one based on mutual love and respect, the weapon being held to the heads of both parties was the prospect of a disruptive annual meeting next week, where either side could have lost face and fund managers faced a difficult decision over who to support.The balance appeared to tip in Yahoo’s favour on Friday when Bill Miller, chief investment officer of Legg Mason, the fund manager with a 4.4 per cent stake, said he expected to back the existing board.He also urged the two sides to reach a compromise and issued a veiled invitation to Microsoft to renew its bid for the company.While exchanging barbs publicly, Mr Icahn and the Yahoo board had been talking privately for some time, according to a person close to Yahoo.These talks “heated up” over the weekend and led to a deal being signed early on Monday morning. The person described it as “a good deal for Yahoo”. Eight of Yahoo’s nine directors will survive, with Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, stepping down to spend more time on his newly formed video game company.Mr Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, will take his place and the board will be expanded to 11 members. Jonathan Miller, former chief executive of AOL, will join and the Yahoo board will choose one from eight remaining nominees on Mr Icahn’s slate.Mr Miller’s name was put forward by Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s chief executive, according to the person, but he played down speculation that Mr Miller could become an executive of the company or help to negotiate a merger with AOL. “Yahoo’s thinking is that he’s an additive board member, not management,” he said.With the annual meeting vote swinging in its favour from Legg Mason’s support, some analysts feel Yahoo could have achieved a clean sweep next week and did not need to strike a deal.But factors such as the possibility of a poor reception for its second-quarter earnings announcement, due later today, and other influential investor groups recommending support for some members of the Icahn slate, is thought to have governed Yahoo’s thinking.“ISS [Institutional Shareholder Services] frequently suggests that you vote for a couple of dissidents, some of Yahoo’s big shareholders had indicated they would have liked a split, so rather than take its chances, Yahoo saw the opportunity to control it,” said the person.Analysts were split on whether the deal would make a sale to Microsoft more likely.“We think the agreement makes a sale of Yahoo or its search business less likely,” said Scott Kessler, IT analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, in a note.Youssef Squali, analyst at Jefferies & Company, said: “We believe that chances of a Microsoft deal, under the watch of this hybrid board remains high in our view, but not imminent.”Allen Weiner, analyst with the Gartner research firm, said it was time for Yahoo to stop thinking short-term and to bring together consideration of its leadership and strategic direction.“These are micro-moves, I don’t see them having long-lasting impact on the development of products and services, I’m much more interested in what the company is going to do there rather than moves that are all about the stock price,” he said.Stemming the exodus of key staff and building up morale should be priorities, he added. “You can change people at the top but if that’s not going to stop the exodus of brilliant minds leaving Yahoo, then nothing’s going to help them.”

Activision Blizzard combines a successful console games publisher with the creator of World of Warcraft, an online PC role-playing game that has attracted more than 10m paying subscribers.In addition to monthly subscriptions, the new company has said it could become a rival to iTunes with a music download service, an extension of its successful Guitar Hero game, which has seen more than 15m song downloads.Robin Kaminsky, head of publishing, says online downloads of game extensions, such as new maps for its Call of Duty combat title, can also stretch out the revenue stream from a game.”This increases the number of consumers coming in as late adopters, lets us sell those games at launch-pricing for a longer period of time and extends the lifecycle of those games so they’re not just launched and then abandoned [in terms of development],” she says.Martin Zagorsek, vice president of games and software at the NPD research firm, says as long as games and consoles are part of gift-giving, video games will remain highly seasonal.But he says the expanding demographic of gamers will have an effect.”Children are much more likely to be given gifts than adults, but as this becomes more of an all-age activity, the older gamers are more likely to buy things for themselves when they feel like it, which will alter the seasonality,” he says.The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) at the Los Angeles Convention Center will feature previews of much anticipated games such as Gears of War 2, Fallout 3 and Dead Space.Sales of console games were up 62 per cent on last year to the end of May, according to NPD, the increase from $1.7bn to $2.8bn being attributable in large part to the release of the blockbuster Grand Theft Auto IV.

Attendees were reduced from 60,000 to about 5,000 after publishers said the show had become too big and expensive, and this year’s show will continue on this smaller scale.Nowadays, bigger companies seem happier holding their own events and conventions for gamers or putting money into game shows in Leipzig and Tokyo that can expand their presence internationally.The replacement of the cacophony of demonstrations from the gamut of game companies at E3 with a smaller, calmer affair is a sign of the consolidation taking place and the revised thinking of the new industry leaders.Vivendi has made the biggest move of the leading media companies on the industry, owning a 52 per cent stake in the new Activision Blizzard.“I think that interest has always been there from the major media companies,” says John Riccitiello, chief executive of the long-time industry leader, Electronic Arts. “The Vivendis and Disneys and Time Warners and News Corps want to participate more directly in the games business.”Disney and Time Warner have stepped up their investments in the business and News Corp has been rumoured as a possible rival to EA in its $2bn bid for Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto franchise.Mr Kotick, in a Financial Times interview, said Hollywood studios were increasingly buying smaller publishers as they looked to exploit their own intellectual property. “It goes in phases, Disney and Warner are new competitors. Disney has a lot of natural advantages in that they own a lot of compelling properties. Warner too, with Batman and Superman.”Although Activision Blizzard and EA bestride the “third-party” publishers, Mr Kotick pointed out they could still be outspent and outbid for talent by the first-party players – the console makers who also have game-development studios.The console makers are expected to make the biggest news at the show. Edward Woo, games analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, says Microsoft is almost certain to cut the price of its Xbox 360, while Nintendo and Sony are rumoured to be updating their handheld gaming devices.On the game front, E3 appears to be heading for a bad dose of sequel-itis.“Fallout 3, Gears of War 2, Fable 2, Resident Evil 5, Halo Wars, Resistance 2 are sequels,” says Peer Schneider of the IGN game network. “We’re all really hoping that there’s some fresh blood coming in, new games that are not just continuations of existing franchises.”

194;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-07-10T21:41:49Z;Guitar Hero aims to take on iTunes;;"Activision Blizzard, the games company formed by the merger of Activision with Vivendi’s games unit, plans to capitalise on the popularity of its Guitar Hero franchise by developing an online music platform that could rival iTunes.In an interview with the Financial Times, Bobby Kotick, chief executive of the new company, said creating a Guitar Hero online music platform was “the natural evolution” of a franchise that has sold close to 20m units and generated $1bn in revenues.“I don’t think there have been a lot of credible alternatives to iTunes, but Guitar Hero certainly has that potential,” he said, adding players could already download “note tracks” to use while playing the game.The merger of Activision with Vivendi Games completed on Thursday. The new company would benefit from Vivendi’s ownership of Universal Music and of payment and processing capability in “virtually every country”, said Jean-Bernard Levy,
Vivendi chief executive.“These are all the things that enable you to be a successful competitor [to iTunes],” Mr Kotick added. The company would have to strike deals with the other large music labels if it were to launch a service that could compete effectively with the Apple platform.Activision Blizzard is understood to be competing with MTV Games for a deal with The Beatles management to bring out a guitar-based game featuring Beatles’ songs. Apple’s iTunes has been denied access to the Fab Four’s catalogue to date.Activision has to decide what to do with $3.5bn of cash that was originally going to fund a tender offer. However, the offer price was set before a sharp rise in Activision Blizzard’s shares, which makes it unlikely to be taken up.Mr Levy and Mr Kotick said the cash would either be returned to shareholders or used to finance acquisitions.They declined to comment on whether the company would enter the bidding for Take-Two, the games publisher behind the successful Grand Theft Auto franchise.Electronic Arts has launched a hostile bid for the company.The merger of Vivendi Games with Activision has created a company with strengths in console and multi-player online role-playing games.Vivendi Games owns World of Warcraft, the world’s biggest online role-playing game with more than 10m subscribers, while Activision has ties with Hollywood studios and produces the Spider-Man and James Bond console titles.The new company will also concentrate its efforts on global expansion. “We have a strong presence in Asia and when you combine the two companies there are going to be opportunities to grow, particularly in Europe,” Mr Levy said.The two men forecast a period of growth for games publishers, which would be fuelled by international expansion and new lines of business, such as merchandising and licensing."
195;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-06-22T22:32:15Z;Beatles seek to join video game revolution;;Beatles representatives are in talks with two companies to create a Beatles-themed video game in a move that could pave the way for a broader licensing of the Fab Four’s catalogue.The representatives have held discussions with both Activision and MTV Games, the respective makers of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games, in which players strum along to favourite songs or form virtual bands.A final deal would be worth several million dollars, according to a person familiar with the talks, and could be reached in a matter of weeks. However, it would have first to win the blessing of both Apple Corps, the company established by the band to oversee its business interests, and EMI, the UK music group that owns the Beatles master recordings. Both declined to comment.The surviving Beatles and their heirs have been cautious about exploiting their material on new platforms. They were slow to re-issue their albums on compact disc.In spite of repeated discussions, EMI and Apple Corps have yet to license Beatles recordings for digital use, including for sale through Apple’s iTunes music store.Apple Corps has become more active in recent months since Jeff Jones took over as chief executive.The company, whose board includes Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison and Yoko Ono Lennon, has allowed Beatles compositions to be used on American Idol and in a Las Vegas show.Martin Bandier, chief executive of Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which controls more than 200 Beatles copyrights, said the exposure on American Idol had yielded a number of inquiries, including from mobile phone carriers.“To my view, it’s only a matter of time before we see Beatles songs that are the original recordings in motion pictures, in television work, and yes, maybe even one day in a commercial,” said Mr Bandier, arguing that sensitivities about commercialism should be balanced against the merits of exposing the band to a younger generation.The Beatles could help sway a battle between Activision and Electronic Arts, the biggest US video game publishers. Activision has generated more than $1bn so far from Guitar Hero as sales approach 20m units.EA, in partnership with MTV, introduced Rock Band in November. Thanks to added functionality, the game has sold more than 3m copies.An Activision spokesman declined to comment on whether it was competing for Beatles rights. MTV said: “We are talking to virtually every major rock artist all the time about ways we might get them involved in Rock Band.”
196;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-02-25T23:23:48Z;EA races against clock in $2bn merger;;"Electronic Arts on Monday warned rival video game publisher Take-Two that “time was of the essence” and there was no certainty any other buyer would emerge to top its $2bn takeover offer for the owner of the Grand Theft Auto franchise.“Our preference is to make this a friendly transaction, we are hopeful we can achieve that,” John Riccitiello, EA chief executive, said on Monday.Take-Two’s shares rose 52 per cent from Friday’s close to $26.40 on Monday, following EA’s disclosure on Sunday that it had made a $26 a share offer for the company a week ago. Take-Two’s board had rejected it as “inadequate” on Friday.The world’s biggest independent video games publisher warned that the value of the deal to EA would dissipate if it could not be completed soon.EA is keen to finalise a deal in time for the launch by Take-Two of Grand Theft Auto IV on April 29. This would give its global publishing and distribution business time to boost sales of the most anticipated title of the year in the industry.“We would sell more of it; we have subsidiaries in places that, given their scale, I don’t think they’ve ever visited,” Mr Riccitiello said.However, Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, argues the real reason behind EA’s need to complete a takeover bid quickly is the strength of Take-Two’s 2K sports game franchises.While EA leads in sports games sales with titles such as Madden NFL, Take-Two’s 2K titles have earned better reviews in some cases for their more innovative game-play.“The real urgency in getting this deal done is the launch of basketball games in the autumn. It doesn’t make sense to market two of them: they want to eliminate the competition in sports,” he told the Financial Times.The acquisition of Take-Two, and what is expected to be the best-selling game of the year, would be expected to keep EA as the number one publisher, a position threatened in December when the merger between Activision and Vivendi’s games unit was announced.The two sides said the $18.9bn merger would make the new company, Activision Blizzard, “the world’s largest, most profitable, pure-play video game publisher” with about $3.8bn in combined revenues in the 2007 calendar year.The merger is expected to be completed in the first half but a combination of EA and Take-Two is expected to have about $4.8bn in revenues in their 2008 fiscal years.The Activision/Vivendi deal was seen as auguring a period of consolidation in the industry, but at the time EA denied any connection with its reopening of takeover discussions with Take-Two.“We’ve been in an on-and-off dialogue for a year,” Warren Jenson, chief financial officer, told the FT.Mr Riccitiello said he opened talks last March as the newly appointed chief executive, but called them off to turn his attention to reorganising EA into four new divisions or “labels”.He completed the company restructuring in November and reopened discussions with Take-Two’s management in December.Mr Riccitiello expressed surprise at a much-improved compensation package Take-Two’s board awarded to the management team this month after rejecting EA’s initial $25 a share offer.Analysts also voiced concern on Monday at how the lucrative employment terms for the heads of Rockstar Games, the developer of Grand Theft Auto, would fit in with EA’s compensation schemes and whether the group could retain such talent.“It’s not going to get cheaper to work with these guys,” said Mr Riccitiello, who noted that the developer had survived six CEO transitions in five years. “We see them as the asset, the key part of the deal within RockStar, we have great respect for them and expect them to stick around,” he added."
197;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-02-25T19:45:48Z;Video games M&A;;Has John Riccitiello, chief executive of Electronic Arts, been taking lessons from Steve Ballmer?The Microsoft chief’s bear hug on Yahoo bucked the tech sector’s tradition of friendly mergers. Now EA is taking a similar approach with games publisher Take Two Interactive Software. First came the private exchange of letters. Having been rejected, EA has gone public. Its latest missive even echoes Microsoft’s passive aggressive style, thanking Take Two for its “courteous tone” before putting the screws on the management to agree a deal.Like Microsoft in software, EA is used to being top dog in the video games world. Having long relied on a stable of big sports and movie tie-ins, however, it has to expand its offering, particularly in action and role-playing games. Meanwhile, competitors are bulking up. Activision recently agreed a merger with Vivendi’s games business.Buying Take Two at $26 a share would be a quick way for EA to acquire, rather than develop, an established games brand – in this case, the Grand Theft Auto series. EA’s argument that scale counts is strong. Its direct distribution network is powerful, particularly outside the US. Extra resources should help increase the frequency with which Take Two’s best titles are updated.The big risk EA faces, as does Microsoft, is a culture clash. Rockstar Games, Take Two’s big in-house development studio, is the brains behind GTA. Keeping its programmers happy is crucial to the success of any deal. In this, EA’s task looks easier than Microsoft’s. Incorporating another studio into the existing stable should not involve too much upheaval.But EA may have a fight on its hands. A 50 per cent premium is attractive but, at 18 times forward earnings, it is no home run. Unlike Yahoo, which still trades below Microsoft’s offer, Take Two has already leapt ahead of EA’s bid.Post and read comments on this Lex
198;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-02-25T01:32:27Z;EA in $2bn takeover bid for Take-Two;;Electronic Arts has launched a takeover bid that would enable it to retain its position as the world’s biggest independent video game publisher.EA is offering $2bn cash for Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series of games. Take-Two on Sunday night rejected the offer, saying the proposal “substantially undervalues” the company.The board has already rejected two unsolicited private bids from EA this month. This forced EA out into the open on Sunday to bring its proposal “to the attention of all Take-Two shareholders”.EA and Take-Two had combined revenues of $4.1bn in the 2007 fiscal year, meaning that a merger would be likely to give EA the edge over the expected combination of Activision and Vivendi’s games division in the first half of this year.The $18.9bn merger of Activision and Vivendi to create Activision Blizzard, “the world’s largest, most profitable pure-play video game publisher” was announced in December, with the two companies having about $3.8bn in combined revenues in the 2007 calendar year.Besides its desire to trump its biggest rival Activision, EA’s offer letter to Take-Two revealed that it coveted its best-selling Grand Theft Auto franchise, with the latest instalment, Grand Theft Auto IV, due for global release on April 29. John Riccitiello, EA chief executive, said he wanted to close the transaction quickly so that EA’s strong publishing and distribution network “can positively impact the catalogue sales of GTA IV”.Mr Riccitiello formally offered $25 per share in cash for Take-Two in a letter to Strauss Zelnick, chairman of the board, on February 6, after talks by the two sides.Mr Zelnick replied on February 15 that the board was open to discussing a business combination “at the right time and the right price”, but EA’s proposal met neither criteria.The EA chief raised his offer to $26 per share last Tuesday, a 64 per cent premium over Take-Two’s closing price a week ago, valuing the company at about $2bn.He threatened to make the offer public if the Take-Two board was not willing to negotiate and did so after Mr Zelnick rejected the new offer in a letter on Friday.In a statement on Sunday, Mr Zelnick said Take-Two had been willing to enter discussions with EA on April 30, a day after Grand Theft Auto IV’s release.“We believe EA’s offer is highly opportunistic and is attempting to take advantage of our upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto IV, one of the most valuable and durable franchises in the industry,” he said.
199;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-02-15T18:55:41Z;Yahoo tries to evade Microsoft;;News Corp was at the top of a shrinking list of options being considered by Yahoo as a way of escaping Microsoft’s unsolicted takeover bid, although investors and analysts generally discounted the chance of a deal to save the company.Talks have been taking place between Yahoo and News Corp about a possible combination of its Fox Interactive Media arm with the internet company. Yahoo would gain the social networking site MySpace, while Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp would take a 20 per cent stake in Yahoo, according to those close to the situation.Other reported options are Yahoo buying Time Warner’s AOL, and Yahoo outsourcing its search to Google.Robert Peck, an analyst at Bear Stearns, did not believe any of the options were viable, and that a combination with Microsoft was the most likely outcome, as Yahoo combined with Microsoft’s MSN would have greater global reach than any merger with AOL or Fox. The Yahoo board could approach the next phase of its deliberations differently.Roy Bostock, who took over as non-executive chairman the same evening that Microsoft made its takeover approach, is understood to have been leading a group of non-executive directors who have been monitoring the situation from the start.Speculation was mounting that he would take more formal control of the process, effectively sidelining Jerry Yang, chief executive, who has been leading the effort to find an alternative to Microsoft. “Bostock doesn’t have the emotional commitment,” said a person familiar with matters.There were also reports of a board split – with Jerry Yang, Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, and Softbank’s Eric Hippeau favouring any option other than a Microsoft takeover, whose offer is valued at $40.38bn at Thursday’s closing Microsoft price.One person close to the situation said he “gathered” there was a split and that billionaire Ron Burkle, in particular, had been receptive when Microsoft made an approach in the summer.But analysts said there were still appealing aspects to Yahoo’s other options.Shahid Khan, an analyst at IBB Consulting, pointed to the massive internet audience that a Fox Interactive-Yahoo merger would create, and its power in particular content verticals. The two groups could combine Yahoo Sports, for example, with Fox Sports, and Yahoo Finance with the Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch websites.“If you take a step back, it could make a lot of sense for them,” Mr Khan said.Yet investors were broadly skeptical, citing everything from tight credit markets to regulatory concerns.“This is Yahoo and Goldman Sachs as their banker looking for a headline to try to get a higher offer from Microsoft,” one media investor said, adding: “I don’t see any other option for Yahoo than taking Microsoft’s bid.”The deal would clearly benefit News Corp. The company would be able to trade an asset – MySpace – that still represents internet promise more than real-world profits for a stake in a much larger company that generates substantial earnings. Just the mention of the proposed deal helps Mr Murdoch’s effort to establish a high valuation for MySpace.Yet one sign investors do not believe the deal will go ahead is that News Corp’s shares failed to rally. They stood at $19.92 in midday trading, after rising above $20 earlier this week.“I don’t see it,” said an­other investor, noting that tight credit markets would make it difficult for private equity funds to part-fund the deal, as had been reported. He also cited regulatory prob­lems if Yahoo were to follow MySpace’s lead and outsource its search function to Google as part of the deal. Still, he admitted, “it would be a home run for News Corp.”The chances of a search marketing alliance with Google, seen as the most direct way to boost Yahoo’s value short of an outright sale, have faded in recent days. Shutting down its own search engine advertising system and outsourcing the work to Google would have saved costs and boosted Yahoo’s income, given the greater effectiveness of the Google ad system, but it would have left Google with an even more dominant share of a business that accounts for more than 40 per cent of all online advertising.
200;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2008-02-12T23:27:00Z;EA chief is his own worst critic;;John Riccitiello did not mince his words about the performance of Electronic Arts over the past year.“This outright pisses me off,” said the chief executive at EA’s analyst day today, referring to a graph showing a three percentage point loss in market share in 2007.He said he was even more annoyed by the downward trend in the quality of EA games – the average rating per title supplied by Metacritic has fallen from 77 to 72 over the past five years.The company also bet on the wrong horse in the next-generation console stakes – favouring development for the PlayStation 3 first, which proved problematic, over the Xbox 360 and lastly the Wii. Wrong call, he said, as was the overinvestment in its Renderware middleware that caused slippages.And then there was the bloating of headcount by 3,000 in three years and development costs increasing to the extent that they were the equivalent of nearly a third of revenues.Three major franchises also disappointed with sub-standard iterations causing slumps in sales for the Need for Speed racing game, NBA basketball and Harry Potter.Of course, it’s easier for Mr Riccitiello as an incoming CEO – he succeeded Larry Probst a year ago – to admit the company has made mistakes and wipe the slate clean. But his candour was refreshing nevertheless.His vision for the company was also invigorating. He has set goals of $6bn in revenues in 2011 and metacritic scores of 80. Outsourcing and offshoring will bring down costs and two campuses have already been closed.He said he was unconcerned about the merger of Activision and Vivendi’s games unit to create the largest publisher later this year.“It’s really a non-event,” he said, arguing it would not make EA any more aggressive.“We’re already at max tilt, we have been changing a lot, we are our own worst critics.”He told analysts he had given an earlier version of his presentation to 225 top EA executives last August.“It was brutal,” he said.
201;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2007-12-18T21:08:28Z;Vivendi goes on high-tech Christmas shopping spree;;Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi chief executive, is stuffing his Christmas stocking with some of this year’s hottest gadgets.A few weeks ago, he took control of Activision, the Californian video games publisher. Now he is negotiating to acquire outright control of Neuf Cegetel, the French alternative telecommunications and high-speed internet service provider.If all goes to plan, SFR, the mobile phone operator 56 per cent owned by Vivendi and 44 per cent held by Vodafone, will acquire the 29.5 per cent stake of commodity trader Robert Louis-Dreyfus in Neuf Cegetel. SFR already owns 40.5 per cent of Neuf Cegetel.With the Louis-Dreyfus stake, it will control 70 per cent of the group, forcing it to make a full takeover offer for the company. This will not be cheap.Indeed, Neuf Cegetel is one of the most expensive telecoms companies in Europe.Since it was floated on the stock market last year, it has seen its value double to close to €8bn ($11.5bn). That puts the cost to SFR of soaking up the 60 per cent or so it does not already own in the company at about €5bn.Mr Lévy does not seem too bothered. He feels it makes strategic sense for SFR to secure watertight control of Neuf Cegetel. This at a time of renewed consolidation in the telecoms sector and a scramble to invest in high-speed internet and higher capacity networks to offer comprehensive internet, voice and digital television packages on mobile phones.The deal also coincides with the French government’s imminent auction of a fourth mobile telephone licence that will further intensify competition in the French market, especially for high-speed networks.He also recently suggested that Vivendi could quite happily spend up to €10bn in acquisitions if it boosted the conglomerate’s four business units: mobile phones, video games, music and pay television. Indeed, he recently considered investing in a Saudi Arabian telecoms company but decided not to because the price was too high and he would not have secured control. Vivendi has also been saying of late it would like to buy Vodafone’s stake in SFR but the UK mobile group is not a seller so far.This could turn out to be a blessing in disguise for the current transaction. After all, the eventual cost for Vivendi of any Neuf Cegetel acquisition would amount to 56 per cent of the total – in line with its present stake in SFR – with Vodafone picking up the rest. If the deal seems worth it for Vivendi, the biggest winner of all is likely to be Mr Louis-Dreyfus.His group originally invested a meagre €10m when Neuf Telecom, as it was then called, was launched in 1998. His stake is now worth about €1.5bn and he decided it was time to take his profit.Not a bad way to celebrate Christmas – especially if his Olympique de Marseille first division football team also finally hits a winning streak.MAN of the yearThe topsy-turvy fortunes this year of Hakan Samuelsson, the genial Swede who runs German truckmaker MAN, are eloquently evoked by his choice of Christmas holiday destination.Last year, he sat in the cold of his homeland pondering the bitter personal defeat that came after MAN’s failed hostile bid for Sweden’s Scania.Even worse, MAN’s independence looked compromised by the creeping influence of carmaker Volkswagen, which took a 29.9 per cent stake in addition to its 36 per cent in Scania. Rumours started to fly that Ferdinand Piëch, VW’s mercurial chairman, wanted to oust Mr Samuelsson.But this Christmas, Mr Samuelsson is heading off to the sunnier climes of Brazil and that could well reflect his current cheerful mood.His turnround of one of the oldest and most traditional conglomerates in Germany can claim to be one of the most outstanding business success stories in recent years.Mr Samuelsson has transformed what was a sprawling example of the conglomerates so unloved by investors into a fast-growing, profitable group. In trucks, MAN has the good fortune of not being present in the US. It is thus not suffering the downturn on the other side of the Atlantic and is benefiting instead from the extraordinary growth in eastern Europe. Its diesel engine and turbines businesses are expanding rapidly.Mr Samuelsson has demonstrated that, while the failed Scania deal showed that he lacked some savoir-faire in a takeover, his overall strategy and focus on the group’s operations are pretty impressive.He disposed of low-margin steel trading operations as well as corporate oddities such as the St Antony vineyard.VW still lurks as a threat to Mr Samuelsson. However, a deal with Scania is no longer a “must” to ensure MAN’s survival but a “nice-to-have” with VW and MAN already controlling 51 per cent of the Swedish company. Mr Piëch could still pounce but Mr Samuelsson would have no trouble finding a different job.european.comment@ft.com
202;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Dollar’s fall delivers takeover bargains;;When France’s Vivendi began flirting with the idea of buying Activision, the US video games group, €1 was worth about $1.30, says Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi’s chief executive. That was in January.On Sunday, when Vivendi revealed a deal to take control of the maker of the Call of Duty war game, €1 was worth $1.47. Although Activision was targeted for strategic reasons, Mr Lévy says that the strengthening of the euro was a bonus. “It helps,” he says. Vivendi is not alone.The focus on the rise of the euro has so far been on the difficulties caused for French, Italian and German exporters such as Airbus. But the feebleness of the US currency has also made transatlantic dealmaking more alluring.Some bankers play down the likelihood of a wave of dealmaking by European companies in the US, due to countervailing factors such as bond market unease and lack of clarity on interest rates. But there is no denying companies’ mounting enthusiasm about their spending power in the US.“It definitely makes US companies much more attractive,” says a member of the management board of Siemens, the German conglomerate. “Our focus is on organic growth but at some stage the exchange rate starts to make it necessary to look very carefully at some American groups.”Ekkehard Schulz, chief executive of Germany’s ThyssenKrupp, says: “It makes US acquisitions cheaper. We are always on the lookout for any possibilities.”For companies whose manufacturing facilities are in the eurozone but which often – or always – price their goods in dollars, buying the owners of US factories is one way of better aligning costs and income.The transatlantic merger and acquisition benefits derived from the strong euro may not be equal to the corresponding cost of inflation suffered at home. It may not make up for the dwindling of profit streams from existing US subsidiaries after they are translated from dollars to euros. But it is at least partial compensation.Rainer Krause, a partner at Hengeler Müller, one of Germany’s leading M&A law firms, says: “The low dollar has driven a lot of companies in the eurozone to look at US deals they might otherwise not have looked at – or looked at right now. It is not only a matter of price but also of securing sourcing and production capabilities if the euro continues to be strong – and expensive.”Robert Friedmann, chief executive of Würth, one of Germany’s biggest privately held industrial groups, says his company has done pretty much all it can internally to offset the impact of the weaker dollar on its operations, leaving one external option: “What we can do perhaps is buy companies in the US because they are cheap due to the exchange rate.”For some deals, the benefits of using euro profits to fund US acquisitions can be diluted by a decision to take out dollar-denominated borrowings as a form of hedging for the deal.In the Vivendi-Activision deal, however, the cash component of up to $2.4bn has come from existing euro-denominated reserves.Italy’s Luxottica, the world’s largest maker and seller of high-end sunglasses, has already made a big saving on a US acquisition this year. In June it announced it was buying its rival Oakley for $2.1bn. By the time the deal closed last month, a weakening dollar had saved Luxottica €130m ($191m). As the festive season arrives, it may not just be consumers who flock to New York for goods at prices that seem like a steal back home.Reporting by Adam Jones in Paris, Richard Milne and Gerrit Wiesmann in Frankfurt and Adrian Michaels in Milan
203;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Activision-Vivendi games deal boosts rivals;;Shares in video game publishers rose on Monday amid speculation that the merger of Activision and Vivendi’s games division to create the largest publisher would trigger an industry shake-up.Analysts welcomed the deal as “game-changing”, but warned that Vivendi’s World of Warcraft game it hinged on had an unpredictable future. Activision shares rose 13 per cent to $25.03 in morning trading. Vivendi shares rose 1 per cent to €31.71 on Monday. In a complicated deal, Vivendi is injecting its games business into Activision to create a new company valued at an estimated $18.9bn, Activision Blizzard. Vivendi is also buying $1.7bn worth of shares to generate cash for a subsequent tender offer.Activision shareholders will be offered $27.50 a share in a buyback that could lift Vivendi’s stake in the new company from 52 per cent to 68 per cent.Take Two Interactive, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto game and the subject of frequent takeover speculation, rose 6 per cent, while Ubisoft shares rose nearly 10 per cent at one point in Paris on speculation that Electronic Arts would increase its 15 per cent stake in the French publisher.Shares in EA, the world’s biggest video game publisher, fell 1.5 per cent to $55.30 as investors digested the prospect of the emergence of a larger rival.Brent Thill, Citigroup analyst, said in a note: “Smaller publishers like THQ and Take-Two could benefit as global media companies are likely to kickstart their video game acquisition strategies post Vivendi’s move”.Jonathan Weitz of media consultants IBB said: “The environment has been right for the last year or two for media companies to take greater stakes in video game publishers.”Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision, who will head the enlarged entity, said Activision would have had to risk hundreds of millions of dollars to try to duplicate the success of Blizzard Entertainment’s online fantasy hit, World of Warcraft. The game has 9.3m subscribers and has made Vivendi the only western publisher to show a significant profit in Asia.Michael Savner of Bank of America Securities said the deal was a game-changer but Vivendi’s own endgame was unclear and World of Warcraft could fall out of favour with players. Brent Thill said it generated about 75 per cent of Vivendi Games’ revenues, but questioned how long the phenomenon could last.Additional reporting by Adam Jones in Paris
204;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2007-12-03T15:26:29Z;Vivendi joins forces with Activision;;"Vivendi is set to take control of Activision of the US through an alliance that would create the world’s biggest video games publisher and bring the hit titles World of Warcraft, Guitar Hero and Call of Duty under one corporate roof.The French group, whose activities span recorded music, pay-TV and mobile telephony, said it planned to merge its Vivendi Games unit with Activision, a Nasdaq-listed pioneer of computer games. It would then seek to raise its stake in Activision to a maximum of about 68 per cent.The complicated proposal underlines how Vivendi’s once lossmaking games division has been transformed into a desirable business by the success of World of Warcraft, an online fantasy game from Vivendi’s California-based Blizzard Entertainment.Activision has also been doing well. Last week, it raised forecasts for the period up to Christmas following the success of the latest instalments of Guitar Hero, a rock riff simulator, and Call of Duty, a war game.If approved by Activision shareholders, the first stage of the alliance would involve the injection of Vivendi Games into Activision in return for shares. Activision, whose management backs the merger, would simultaneously issue $1.7bn (€1.2bn)_of new shares to Vivendi at $27.50 each, a 24.2 per cent premium to Activision’s Friday close of $22.15. Vivendi would emerge with about 52 per cent of the enlarged business.If that transaction closes, Activision Blizzard – the planned name for the new group – would buy back and cancel some stock in a $27.50-per-share tender, partly funded by the $1.7bn received from Vivendi (and by the issue of up to $700m of shares to the French group).So Vivendi, in return for up to $2.4bn in cash and injecting its own games business – valued at $8.1bn – and after a leveraged $4bn buy-back, will end up with as much as 68 per cent of the business.Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi chief executive, told the Financial Times Vivendi did not bid for the whole company because it wanted it to remain listed.The enlarged company would aim for pro forma operating income of $1.1bn and earnings per share of more than $1.20 in 2009. The deal would create $50m-$100m in savings, Mr Lévy said. Goldman Sachs advised Vivendi; Activision was advised by Allen & Company.Shares in Activision jumped $4.06, or 18 per cent, to $26.21 in early New York trading on Monday. In Paris, Vivendi shares were 1.7 per cent higher at €31.91."
205;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2007-12-02T19:31:06Z;Complex deal to bring Activision from EA’s shadow;;Activision has finally emerged from the shadow of its larger rival Electronic Arts with its agreement to merge with the games division of France’s Vivendi.In a masterstroke by Bobby Kotick, chief executive, it has gained a similar geographical reach to EA and a highly profitable subscription revenue stream.EA and Activision have failed to expand into the market for massively multiplayer online role-playing games, which have enjoyed huge popularity in Asia.World of Warcraft, created by Vivendi’s Blizzard Entertainment, is the dominant game in the genre worldwide with 9.3m players paying monthly subscriptions to continue to explore the expanding virtual world.Activision Blizzard is being formed in a complex cash and shares transaction valuing it at $18.9bn. Electronic Arts has a market capitalisation of $17.7bn.The new company will have $3.8bn in revenues in the 2007 calendar year, while EA is expecting $3.5bn in revenues for its fiscal year ending in March 2008.Activision Blizzard and EA would be closely matched, but Mr Kotick can finally claim to have achieved the industry leadership he has sought since taking over Activision in 1991.“When we acquired the company, I always felt the opportunity was to become the number-one company in the category,” he said in a recent interview with the Financial Times. “That aspiration hasn’t changed.”The price to pay for achieving that is control. While he remains chief executive of the new company, Vivendi will own 52 per cent of the shares and could raise its stake to 68 per cent through a planned share buy-back. Vivendi suggested it would not be a sleeping partner – it will have six directors on the new 11-member board.“We look forward to being an active and supportive majority stockholder in a company that is poised to lead the worldwide interactive entertainment industry in the years ahead,” said Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi chief executive.In an interview with the FT, he described Activision as the “perfect fit” for Vivendi’s games unit, complementing its strength in subscription-based gaming. “Its strong points are in the console business,” he said.In spite of the strong growth posted by Vivendi Games recently, it has sometimes been overlooked because it was significantly smaller than other Vivendi divisions, such as Universal Music, the world’s biggest recorded music group, or Canal Plus, the pay-TV group. The alliance with Activision would put the games business on a more equal footing, Mr Lévy said.He added the deal would not involve an unacceptable dilution of the strong profitability of the internet-based subscription model that has been so successful for World of Warcraft. “Yes, the margins are huge in the online business, but they are very nice in the console business.”Mr Lévy said there might be ways of using Universal’s record catalogue as downloads for Guitar Hero, Activision’s hit rock guitar simulation game. “It is not by chance that Doug Morris [the head of Universal] will sit on the board of Activision.”He said Mark Morhaime, president and chief executive of Blizzard, and other key Blizzard employees had committed to staying for at least five years. The deal is subject to the approval of Activision shareholders and regulatory approval.
206;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2007-12-02T19:10:38Z;Vivendi and Activision;;Vivendi seems to revel in the notion of being a holding company. The French group already has the bulk of its value tied up in stakes in telecoms operator SFR, pay-television operator Canal Plus and US entertainment group NBC Universal, controlled by General Electric. Now it is injecting its fully owned games business into US rival Activision in return for a controlling stake. Why?For Vivendi, the complex deal will replace its somewhat overlooked video games publishing business with a powerful stake of between 52 per cent and 68 per cent in a group that will challenge market leader Electronic Arts. That will provide a clear market valuation for Vivendi’s business, although the $8.1bn being claimed upfront relies on a degree of circularity in the complex transaction.The deal also diversifies Vivendi’s Blizzard business away from a heavy reliance on games such as World of Warcraft, adds Activision’s management team and provides a separate share currency to try to attract key gaming talent.Activision, meanwhile, gets exposure to new Asian markets and online gaming, the fast-growing area where Vivendi has made huge strides. That is particularly important because of the recurring revenues it offers, compared with more cyclical console-based sales. Activision shareholders also get the option of taking a 25 per cent premium in cash for a portion of their shares. And, despite ceding overall control to Vivendi, Robert Kotick will remain as chief executive of the combined group.Vivendi will rely heavily on him to squeeze the benefits the two sides expect from the deal. But, in contrast to 2003, when it ceded control of its US media assets to GE, Vivendi will ultimately be in the driving seat.
207;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2007-11-27T19:19:48Z;Holiday sales cheer for Activision;;Activision boosted the US video game sector on Tuesday as it reported better-than-expected sales of its key holiday titles. Shares in the publisher rose nearly 13 per cent to $21.33 in midday trading in New York on the news, while those of the world’s biggest publisher, Electronic Arts), were up 3.2 per cent.For its third quarter ending December 31, Activision said it was forecasting record sales of $1.225bn and earnings per share of 66 cents. This was an increase from its previous guidance of $1.050bn in revenues and earnings of 51 cents a share.Bobby Kotick, Activision chief executive, said the company was on its way to the most profitable year in its history after a strong consumer response to its titles in October and strong retail sales over the Thanksgiving weekend.“We are confident that the third quarter of fiscal 2008 will be the largest and most profitable quarter ever,” he added.“Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and our newly released Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare already are two of the biggest entertainment titles this year.”Guitar Hero, which features a guitar-shaped controller and allows gamers to play along to well-known hits, has been a hugely profitable franchise for Activision. EA responded last week with the release of Rock Band, a similar game with a microphone and controllers for guitar, bass and drums.Call of Duty has also become a best-selling “first-person shooter” based on the second world war, although its latest version puts the combat in a present-day setting.While EA has a bigger international reach than Activision, the smaller Santa Monica-based company has been the biggest third-party publisher in the US for nine out of 10 months this year.Its market share reached a record 28.7 per cent in October, according to the NPD research firm.Video game publishers are benefiting from selling to a larger installed base of games consoles.Among next-generation consoles, the Nintendo Wii has been selling out since it launched a year ago, the Xbox 360 has been on sale for two years and even sales of Sony’s lagging PlayStation 3 have picked up following a price cut.Sony said on Monday that PS3 sales on Black Friday – the day after Thanksgiving – were up 245 per cent compared with the same day a year ago.
208;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Game player with a serious goal;;"Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision, likes to play guitar on one of the video game publisher’s biggest hits.Guitar Hero satisfies his air guitarist dreams by letting him take charge of the instrument-shaped controller and mimic classic rock anthems.But Mr Kotick is not a centre-stage, arm-swinging axeman when he plays – he prefers background rhythm to being lead guitarist. “I’m not really a music person,” he says. “I don’t really pay as much attention to the music as I do to the rhythm; I’m very focused on getting that right.”Staying out of the creative process while concentrating on the underlying processes has also served him well in management. He has brought his company from insolvency through a spectacular growth period over the past 16 years. In the first eight months of this year, Activision became the leading US third-party publisher – publishers licensed by the console makers, who also make their own “first-party” games – finally overtaking its biggest rival, Electronic Arts, in sales.Mr Kotick does not have the appearance of an industry veteran. In spite of being the longest-serving chief executive among the big five US publishers – EA, Activision, THQ, Take-Two and Midway Games – he cuts a youthful figure, at the age of 44, and has a puckish sense of humour.Then again, his coiffed hair and elegant suits do not fit the image of an unconventional industry or of someone who had started a company developing software for Apple computers in college, before getting into video games.He failed to complete his course in art history at the University of Michigan but is now a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a serious collector of post-war American art.Mr Kotick therefore cuts a Renaissance figure in the industry, as someone who is both patron and creator of the latest art forms and has made their development possible by persistent profitability. He has combined passion with process in a business where organised chaos has often reigned.Before taking charge of Activision, he ran a company called Leisure Concepts – a licensing agent for Nintendo that handled image rights for its game character Mario the Plumber on everything from T-shirts to breakfast cereal packets. But he really wanted to be a licensee, making video games with the console maker’s permission.It was when he was in charge of Leisure Concepts that he spotted an opportunity in an insolvent games publisher: “Activision – they’d actually changed their name to Mediagenic, which I think is one of the worst names in corporate American history – were the first Nintendo licensee and the first third-party software publisher, and they were insolvent,” he says.“The few hundred people left at the company referred to it as Lackovision and I think they suffered a lot from that, combined with a challenging industry at the time.”Mr Kotick traded out of his stake in Leisure Concepts and bought a 25 per cent stake in Mediagenic in December 1990. In March 1991, he and his associates took charge of the company.“The day we got control, the sheriff’s marshals were there taking away our mainframe computer with all our customer data. We had to sell the furniture to make payroll the next month. It was quite a mess.”Heavy job losses followed, the company was recapitalised the following year, the Activision name was restored and the decision was taken to move from Silicon Valley to Santa Monica, close to the Hollywood movie studios and their
talent pools.The relationship has been getting closer ever since. Activision subsequently won rights to franchises such as Spider-Man, Shrek and James Bond. “If you own Hollywood property and you want to have it in interactive media, I think we’re the first stop,” says Mr Kotick. “Being here, we feel we have this unique perspective, an appreciation of what’s important to our partners.”The video game business is also getting more like Hollywood. Mr Kotick feels the latest consoles provide the power for game developers to tell stories with cinematic realism, create compelling characters and provoke emotions in players that will help companies such as Activision expand their audience beyond the traditional core of young male gamers.In the early 1990s, cartridge games dominated and Activision lacked major franchises. Instead, it had to resuscitate some of its own intellectual property such as the 1980s dungeon adventure series Zork and jungle game Pitfall!. Mr Kotick says the company has never failed to make a profit since those early years.“We’ve always operated under the belief that you could run a video game business as professionally as you could run a consumer packaged goods business and you wouldn’t diminish creativity.“I think I always thought I was running Procter & Gamble – it didn’t really occur to me that it wasn’t an enormously successful, professionally managed company, even on the days we were selling the furniture.”To maintain the creative spirit, Mr Kotick has allowed Activision’s various development studios, many of them acquired, to remain independent operations with their own names, culture and budget responsibilities (see below left).At the same time, he has borrowed the focus-group techniques of the consumer goods industry. Studios are encouraged to use them to carry out audience research.The chief executive also believes in trying to “map the market” – making sure that Activision’s portfolio and coverage closely follows market trends. This requires a balanced approach of having original properties, such as its Call of Duty second world war game, combined with licensed titles such as Transformers. It also means achieving a balance of revenues geographically. He admits Activision still has some way to travel in competing with Electronic Arts overseas and, like other US publishers, has failed to make an impression in Japan.The company’s earnings and revenues have grown at a compound rate of more than 30 per cent over the past seven years. It expects operating income of $250m on net sales of $1.87bn in the current fiscal year. That gives it just under 10 per cent of the $22bn market, excluding Japan, for packaged games. Mr Kotick is focused on expanding that market share.“When we acquired the company, I always felt the opportunity was to become the number-one company in the category,” he says. “That aspiration hasn’t changed.”Collecting creatives a winning tactic in games arenaWhen Activision bought video game developer Bizarre Creations, based in Liverpool in the UK last month, it was following strict criteria laid down by Bobby Kotick for making acquisitions.The US publisher has acquired a dozen companies in the past five years, most of them studios with a history of successful work. “You want profitability, some proprietary development capability that is proven and successful, you want them to have a history of multi-million unit sellers, you want good management and you want it to be non-dilutive financially,” he says. “The few times that we haven’t stuck to that criteria, we’ve made mistakes.”The chief executive is also looking for companies with the potential to lead categories. Last year he bought RedOctane, publisher of the Guitar Hero franchise, and Infinity Ward in 2003, which developed the Call of Duty second world war game.He says independent studios have been falsely accused of lacking discipline. “We pick our studios carefully and allow an independent culture. I find them deadline-focused, milestone-driven, incredibly responsible and sensitive to the needs of the audiences.”"
209;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2007-02-07T23:53:34Z;Activision bullish on video game sector;;Activision, the number-two US video game publisher, on Wednesday predicted a return to double-digit growth for the industry, helped by a new generation of consoles and the launch of Microsoft’s Vista operating system.The Santa Monica company raised its revenue expectations from those given in a pre-announcement less than two weeks ago, predicting sales of $200m for its fourth quarter ending in March, up from $170m.It explained it now had better visibility on the PlayStation 3’s launch in Europe in March.Net revenue forecasts for the fiscal year were raised to $1.40bn from $1.37bn and it adjusted its loss per share forecast from 9 cents to 8 cents for the seasonally quiet fourth quarter.In January, Activision pre-announced it had blown away expectations in its busiest holiday-season quarter with sales in the range of $822.8m compared to a prior outlook of $600m. Earnings per share of 41 cents were up from 23 cents a year earlier.It confirmed these expectations on Wednesday with Bobby Kotick, chief executive, declaring the third quarter “the largest and most profitable quarter in our history.”“Fiscal 2008 will mark a new era in gaming, with double-digit growth expected to return,” he said, pointing to the launch of Vista as a powerful gaming platform and the worldwide availability of next-generation consoles.Activision said its third quarter figures were boosted by the strength of its Call of Duty World War Two franchise, its Tony Hawk skateboarding games and two new properties – the Guitar Hero game that simulates playing the instrument and the Marvel: Ultimate Alliance superheroes game.Guitar Hero II was the number one console and handheld game in dollars in the US in December and the company announced it would launch a version for the Xbox 360 console in the spring.It said games linked to major movie releases – Spiderman 3, Shrek the Third and Transformers – would drive revenues at the beginning of its next fiscal year.
210;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T23:00:27+0000;Battle stations;;Colonel Hank Keirsey is in a tight spot. Enemy tanks have just rumbled round a corner on the cobbled streets of Chambois in Normandy, and he is hopelessly exposed.“This is not a good place to be,” he says to himself. “Better go low.”He takes cover, tumbling into a bank of reeds edging a stream running alongside the road, and then wades through shallow water until he finds himself under the protective arch of a low stone bridge.Now’s the time to collect himself and seize the initiative.“Let’s go where that bastard is,” he says, sighting a German Tiger tank that is last in the convoy.“I’ve got a smoke grenade. If he goes by me, I can climb up on his back deck and throw it down the hatch.”Keirsey jumps back on to the bank and, timing his run, leaps forward in hot pursuit as the tank lumbers past.He closes rapidly but, in an instant, he feels a tremendous impact. He falls and rolls, and then lays still. With his vision turning blood-red and fading, his last sight is of an American jeep with mounted machine gun, packed with soldiers, disappearing down the road - he has been run over by his own men.In real life, the colonel (retired) sits back in his chair in the darkened room, with a look of disgust on his face. “I don’t like getting my ass kicked in anything, but I’m playing here with all these pasty-faced gamers and they’re whipping my butt.“I can’t stand it!” he says.Keirsey is at the headquarters of Activision, America’s second-largest video game publisher, in the laid-back suburb of Santa Monica in Los Angeles.He is playing the latest version of its second-world-war game for next-generation consoles - Call of Duty 3 - on an Xbox 360 hooked up to a widescreen monitor. Its predecessor, Call of Duty 2, came out a year earlier when Microsoft’s machine was first launched. It became the bestselling game on the new console. The sequel will appear this month, timed for the release of the Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii, the rival next-generation consoles.Keirsey is the military adviser on the game, and is visiting from New York to check on and play a final multi-player version with 20 gamers from enthusiast magazines and websites.Apart from being outplayed and out-fought, he is appalled at the chaotic battle order as the gamers run riot across the virtual streets of Chambois.“They are all over the place, nobody’s talking to each other. In a perfect world, everyone puts on their headsets and says: ‘I’m moving to the left, you’re moving to the right,’ but here you’ve just got a bunch of individuals.”He surrenders his chair to one of the pasty-faced gamers and watches as he “spawns” his character back to life and rearms with a Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR).“I’ve actually fired a BAR from the shoulder,” he tells him.“How was that? Nice kick?”“It does have a nice kick. I actually fired about 1,000 rounds on a BAR one time, when I was demonstrating it for cadets. The BAR is a wonderful weapon.”Keirsey, 52, taught cadets drill, how to shoot, combat tactics and military history and ethics at West Point military academy for five years before his retirement in 2000.He is a master parachutist and a ranger, and was awarded the Bronze Star with the 82nd Airborne Division when his battalion spearheaded the 1991 attack on Iraqi forces.“We were assigned to the French for the battle plan and they attacked alongside us over the border, and we captured the high ground. Then our job was to get in trucks and follow them in case there were any trenches to clear out.”It is this first-hand experience of combat that makes the colonel so valuable to Activision and the developers of the game.“He’s just absolutely key to the success of the franchise and its authenticity,” says Jeremy Luyties, the lead designer, whose respect for the colonel extends to addressing him as “Sir”.“We’re trying to paint a picture, and he is the paint we use - when we want to understand how a battle is fought, Hank is the man we ask.”“I’m able to add the little things, the final tweak,” Keirsey says modestly. “Like this is what a soldier would say, this is how he would move around a corner, this is how he would clear a building, this is the radio traffic you would hear when you’re calling for artillery fire, this is how an infantry company would operate with tanks…“In another room, gamers are playing a different version of the game made for Sony’s PlayStation 3 on stunning high-definition screens.The three major consoles, from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, each have their own unique features, and game discs from one will not play on another.Microsoft has set itself apart with the strength of the online multi-player element to its games, while Sony is producing the most technologically advanced and expensive console - it will cost $600 in its premium version. It includes a high-storage Blu-ray DVD drive and ultra-fast graphics showing rich detail, making any flaws more obvious.“I don’t know who designed that rifle scope,” says Keirsey, eyeing a weapon being aimed, “it has a very small objective lens - that’s fine in broad daylight, but it would be absolute dog shit for dusk.”In this single-player version of the game, the player is working closely with his comrades, who are moving just the way Keirsey intends them to on their mission.“Everybody beside you is driven by artificial intelligence, and they’re yelling at you and saying ‘Hey! I’m over here!’, so you get the feeling you’re actually a member of a team.”Out of uniform, dressed in a polo shirt and slacks and with a close-cropped beard, the colonel is still far smarter than the slovenly gamers and developers around him. But there is a team bonding of sorts and mutual respect.“It’s a different battle rhythm,” he says of the dress sense, late-morning arrivals and late-night working habits of the developers. “You can’t form them up and run them in PT [physical training], which is what I’d really like to do, but this dishevelled mass of humanity, moving about, lowing like cattle, making guttural noises, somehow produce some wonderful games.”And yet Keirsey had somehow managed to assemble eight of the dishevelled mass on the beach at Santa Monica early that morning for a workout, running on sand and wearing 75lb weight-vests as something of a reality check.“It was the equivalent of Omaha beach with full pack and equipment, and because we couldn’t simulate the fear of enemy fire, I made them run up every one of those damn ramps on the beach to the top of the palisades. So you will see eight humans in here today looking more powerful than they normally would.”In a third room, Keirsey tries in vain to master the Nintendo Wii version of the game. Nintendo’s focus with its next-generation console - the cheapest at $250 - has been on the game-playing experience and features a revolutionary wireless controller.It contains a motion-sensing device, a speaker and a vibrating “rumble” feature. Its wand-like shape means it can be used as a fishing rod, tennis racket, conductor’s baton, rifle or any other object, depending on the game, providing a more intuitive and natural experience.Hence, the “butt-stroke” movement on Call of Duty: “You move the right side forward, the rifle butt comes round and slaps ‘em upside the head,” explains Keirsey.“Right, let’s go get these Nazi bastards.”Sergeant Bud Hawk has been dodging German Royal Tiger tanks all day as they charge through American machine-gun placements in an orchard at Chambois, desperately seeking an escape route from the closing Allied forces.After successfully directing tank destroyers in the rear to fire on the Tigers, he hides behind an apple tree, from where he is hit in the leg by a tank’s machine gunner. The tank bears down, aiming to crush him under its tracks. Despite his wound, he runs for cover.Rounding a stone outhouse on the edge of the orchard, he literally runs into another Tiger, clanging its rear with his rifle and falling over. He looks up to see a German standing in the turret staring at him. Sergeant Hawk is the least surprised of the two, and shoots the soldier dead.Soon after, the tank destroyers knock out two more Tigers, and a general surrender begins as 500 German soldiers admit defeat.The action this time is real. Sgt Hawk was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honour, for his part in helping to seal the Falaise Gap - an escape route from encirclement soon after the Normandy landings. Ten thousand Germans died and 50,000 were captured in the operation.But the Call of Duty developers have re-created the action in the game in a tribute to the sergeant. Anyone completing this level of the mission is taken to a video interview with the veteran carried out by Keirsey. The whole game revolves around this crucial battle from the different viewpoints of American, Canadian, Polish and British soldiers, and each tells their story to the colonel at its completion.“You’re actually teaching history here by the indirect approach,” says Keirsey. “Fifteen hundred US world war two veterans a day are dying, and so in 10 years this story won’t be told. So maybe that great grandson will play this game and pick up the phone and talk to his great grandfather and ask him what he did, before he passes into the long night.”Keirsey’s father, a second-world-war army veteran, and his uncles, in the navy and air force, have instilled in him a call of duty that carries his thoughts beyond the game and his experiences in the Gulf war to a place in the past.“Absolutely, I would have liked to have fought in that war - wouldn’t you have hated to have lived at that time and then have to say: ‘Well, I just shovelled shit in Louisiana’? Somebody’s got to go in harm’s way and that was a moment of destiny - a chance to be in a place where no one else had fought.”
211;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;SEC investigates Activision over stock options;;Activision, the second largest US video games publisher, has become the latest company to be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its practices in awarding stock options.The company said on Friday it had received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC requesting certain documents and information and would cooperate fully.Activision said it had appointed an independent committee to carry out an internal review of its practices.The SEC is investigating more than 80 companies over possible manipulation of the award dates for options and federal prosecutors have been focusing on technology companies in California.Take-Two in New York and now Los Angeles-based Activision are the two video games publishers to be investigated.Shares in McAfee, the security software company, fell 7 per cent on Friday after it said manipulation of the timing of options meant it would have to restate earnings going back to at least 2003, and the impact would be significant.
212;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2006-05-03T22:50:38Z;EA might suffer loss as it spends on new formats;;Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video games maker, forecast on Wednesday it could swing to a loss in its next financial year as it continued to spend to try to dominate new platforms.At the same time, its rival Activision announced it had wrested a key franchise from EA, winning the exclusive rights to James Bond games until 2014. EA shares fell more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading to $51.70.The Silicon Valley-based company reported a loss of $16m, or 5 cents a share, in its fourth quarter ending March 31, although sales rose 16 per cent to $641m, from $553m a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenues of $581m, according to a consensus gathered by Thomson First Call.Profits for the year were $236m, or 75 cents a share, down from $504m, or $1.59. Revenues were down 6 per cent to $2.951bn.EA had fewer million-selling titles in the year and suffered as consumers slowed spending on games for current-generation consoles in anticipation of the arrival of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 last November and the forthcoming Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii next-generation machines.“This transition is more than a console upgrade,” Larry Probst, chief executive, said. “EA is positioning for global leadership in online, handhelds and mobile phones.”That will require greater investment, and EA said its research and development costs would be 15 to 20 per cent higher in fiscal 2007 than the $758m spent last year.While it forecast revenues would be flat to down about 10 per cent at $2.7bn to $2.95bn, it predicted a substantially lower earnings range of between a profit of 15 cents and a loss of 15 cents.“We continue to invest ahead of revenues for long-term leadership,” Warren Jenson, chief financial officer, said.“We are well into the console transition and now have more than 30 next-generation games in development.”Activision’s new deal for James Bond takes effect immediately.MGM Interactive and Eon Productions, which own the James Bond franchise, said they were awarding Activision worldwide rights to create video games for all current and next-generation consoles as well as PC and handheld platforms.Activision, which has successfully developed games from the Spiderman movie franchise, is likely to base its first game on the latest Bond film, Casino Royale.
213;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2005-11-20T19:35:51Z;New Xbox puts Microsoft ahead;;Microsoft will launch its new console the Xbox 360 at midnight on Monday in North America, with games industry observers predicting it will have a clear lead of a year before rivals Sony and Nintendo launch their next-generation products globally.Sony has guided analysts to expect its PlayStation 3 in the second quarter of 2006, while Nintendo's Revolution is due to appear some time in the second half.But major games publishers developing titles for Microsoft's rivals appear to be geared to having them ready for release at the end of next year. ?They probably wouldn't have products much before the [November Thanksgiving] holiday, if they make Christmas of next year, we would be happy,? said one senior publishing executive, who did not wish to be named.Microsoft's debut in consoles with the original Xbox suffered when it arrived 18 months after Sony launched its PlayStation 2. Although more than 22m Xboxes have been bought, it has consistently trailed Sony, which has sold more than 80m PS2s.A year's lead over Sony means it could have sold 10m consoles worldwide, according to industry estimates, by the time Sony launches in Europe and North America. Sony is expected to have a limited launch in Japan next May.Citigroup analysts said in a report this month that ?the readiness level of [Western] publishers as well as technical constraints at Sony? meant ?most investors currently understand that a broad spring launch is not on the cards and are looking for a [Thanksgiving] holiday 2006 launch date?.Microsoft expects to sell up to 3m units in the first three months the 360 launches in Europe on December 2 and Japan on December 10 with pricing initially limiting it to gaming fanatics.?When the 360 can cost $550 [with accessories] and $60 for a game and a current Xbox or PS2 can be had for less than $100, it's a no-brainer for families new to consoles to buy current generation,? says Ankarino Lara, a director at the Gamespot website for industry news.He says some of the 17 titles at launch are not worth the premium over the $50 or less games made for the original Xbox, but Microsoft's Project Gotham Racing, Kameo: Elements of Power and Activision's Call of Duty 2 fully explore the high-definition technology.?Our four launch titles are $60, but the amount of quality we are delivering has to be the most value per hour of any entertainment media besides television,? Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision, told the FT.?High definition makes the games absolutely stunning,? said John Schappert, a vice-president at Electronic Arts, the world's biggest games publisher.?There is improved movement of the characters and you can see details such as sweat rolling down their faces.?
214;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2005-02-07T23:12:01Z;Activision lifted by strong holidays;;Activision, the video games publisher, on Monday unveiled record third-quarter earnings per share of 63 cents, up 19 per cent from 53 cents in the previous year's Christmas holiday period.Net profit of $97m was up 26 per cent on revenues rising 34 per cent to $680m from $508m last time.The company, which is often suggested as a potential takeover target for larger entertainment groups showing renewed interest in gaming, also raised its targets for the full year.It predicted earnings per share of 87 cents compared with previous guidance of 81 cents. For fiscal 2006, starting in April, the company said it aimed to generate earnings of 91 cents a share on revenues of $1.43bn.Robert Kotick, chairman and chief executive, said in the light of a general shortage of player-consoles, he had been surprised by the strength of demand in the last two weeks of December.International expansion, including new sales and marketing offices in Scandinavia, Poland and Portugal, had paid off earlier than expected. Europe was the company's fastest-growing market during calendar 2004, he said.In common with other leading players in the games market, Activision has a large library of ?franchise? characters and games, including popular film spin-offs Shrek and Spider-Man, the long-established Doom, and sports titles including the Tony Hawk skateboarding series.
215;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2004-09-06T18:39:15Z;Mobile content providers see clearer picture;;Investors in mobile services must be used to a roller-coaster ride as the sector has gone in and out of favour over the past half-decade. Now they may be on the upward slope.Deals signed on both sides of the Atlantic would suggest so. Mforma, the US company which claims to be the world's largest publisher of mobile entertainment content, last month agreed $40m in new finance.The financing, led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, came just two months after Mforma raised $44m in a first round of venture capital. It should fund plans by the group whose products include a wireless game version of Frankenstein and a mobile version of Activision's Call of Duty to acquire rivals in the market for ring tones, wallpaper, games and other material.The injection of new funds followed the announcement of a $13m injection of venture capital into Digital Chocolate, a US-based mobile entertainment company founded by Trip Hawkins, originally of US video games maker Electronic Arts.Other deals completed over the past 12 months with both venture and stock market capital have involved UK, French, German and Chinese companies, as mobile companies have tried to expand into new territories. The picture is not of a return to a straightforward boom, as the turbulent share-price movements this year of listed mobile services companies such as Monstermob and Itouch have shown. Nevertheless, the overall mood does seem to have lifted. Ken Blakeslee of UK-based Webmobility Ventures, which advises a number of mobile companies, says the upturn in interest reflects the fact that the market for mobile content is finally starting to take off.Worldwide user revenues from mobile content-based services will amount to $8bn this year, up from $6.7bn in 2003, according to Strategy Analytics, a consultancy and research firm, and are set to reach $35.3bn by 2008. It says the ring-tone market alone is already worth $2bn a year.The figures reflect the continued rapid development of the worldwide mobile telephone market. More than 1.5bn people now have mobiles exceeding the combined number of PCs and TVs and this is predicted to reach 2bn in 2005.Stefan Rust, director of corporate strategy and venture investments in consumer mobile for Sun Microsystems, points out that a key development has been the wide adoption since early 2003 of the mobile version of his company's Java software, which allows mobile customers to download and use games and other entertainment.?There are already about 350m Java-enabled handsets in use around the world,? he says, ?and more than 100 carriers supporting the software.? The research firm Ovum predicts that the number of Java-enabled mobile devices will increase to 1.5bn in the next three years.The growth in consumer revenues is bolstering mobile content suppliers, according to Patrick Parodi, chair of the Mobile Entertainment Forum, the UK-based trade association which represents about 60 companies in the sector.?A lot of our members have become cashflow positive over the past two years,? he says. ?Money is flowing in the right direction.? He adds that this reflects a key attribute of the mobile industry: ?Mobile users are prepared to pay for content, so long as you can demonstrate the value. That's very different from the fixed-line internet.?The influx of investment in mobile entertainment companies began to pick up speed just under a year ago. Richard Coates, a partner in the technology, communication and entertainment practice at Ernst & Young, says that venture capital companies are looking to build portfolios of mobile entertainment investments so that the small number of successes will pay for the inevitably larger number of failures.?They want volume rather than an individual investment,? Mr Coates says. ?And they are looking for multi-stage investments maybe three or four rounds so that they can validate the business as they go along. The exit route comes either from trade consolidation, or later an IPO.?There is an analogy with the PC and games industry a few years back. Investors did not initially bet on individual games, they bet on companies. Some of these performed better than others. The more successful ones bought the less successful ones and eventually went public. It is a three- to five-year process if you go all the way to IPO. When you get out depends on whether the company you invest in is a consolidator or a consolidatee.?Experts say a venture capital company would typically be looking to get back double its investment in its portfolio over a three- to five-year period, implying an internal rate of return of 20 per cent to 33 per cent. For an early-stage investor, only one or two investments in a 10-company portfolio could be expected to come off, implying that the winners must be capable of producing returns of 10-fold to 20-fold.Mr Rust of Sun Microsystems concludes: ?Many of these companies are making money today. Maybe not as much as they promised their investors, but still cash positive. In the fixed-line internet space, this took five years.?
216;ATVI;Activision Blizzard;2004-08-09T18:19:50Z;The time to diversify carefully is nigh;;The way we consume our media and entertainment, we are constantly told, is changing dramatically. New formats are increasingly winning share of the time and money we spend on media.Indeed, in the US, media watchers suggest that there are more than 120m music video downloads each month. By 2010, the “terabyte” iPod will be able to store every song ever recorded. Games company Activision expects to sell 5m copies of the Spider-Man 2 computer game, with each disc being played by three people for 100 hours each - that’s 15m people playing 1.5bn hours.And then there are the personal digital recorders that give consumers greater power to schedule their own TV viewing and also allow viewers to edit out or fast-forward advertising. In the UK, broadband penetration is rising, with BT predicting that it alone will count 5m broadband homes by 2006. Meanwhile, the UK has the highest digital TV penetration in the world, with more than 50 per cent of TV homes already having access to digital, multichannel TV.These are just some of the competitors pulling viewers and readers away from traditional print and a and their advertisers. So is new media at a tipping point? Is there enough revenue around the corner to make it worth the investment? Can traditional media brands afford to ignore it?Logic dictates that as the use of the internet, multichannel TV and digital entertainment grows, it is going to be harder for established media owners to maintain premium ad rates based around their ability to reach whole swathes of the population. If current trends continue, the simple fact is new media will take up more and more of consumers’ time, traditional media’s reach will decline and advertising will have to evolve to reflect these realities.Of course, stories of companies that jumped too early in the dotcom boom and got their fingers burnt may make executives cautious. It’s true that new media has moved on, even matured, but timing is still crucial when making decisions about extending your brand, your ads and your energies beyond the tried-and-tested money-spinners.While some are making money from their digital ventures, for many, new media is as much about protecting your audience as it is finding new revenue streams. By offering tidbits of its content online, NatMags effectively uses the internet to drive print subscription sales. Several of the UK national newspaper websites are forecasting profits from their online operations.Media owners need to gauge the revenues that are available from new media as well as the threat to their core brand if they do nothing. For example, Emap’s judgment to launch digital channels was as much about making sure that MTV was not the sole owner of the space as it was about looking for new revenues.Some media companies may choose not to do anything on the basis that “old” media is still pretty robust. Overall media consumption in the UK grew by close to 1 per cent per annum between 1997-2003, according to the Henley Centre. Online has recorded the biggest growth at 8 per cent, but magazines and radio have also recorded gains of 3 per cent and 1 per cent per year over the period. While time spent watching TV and reading newspapers has declined, this is by a modest 0.2 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively.Even with the relative declines, TV and newspapers still come out at the top of advertising spend. The bottom line may be that there is still a gap between the time people spend consuming “new” media and the amount of advertising, subscription, cover price, etc money these ventures bring in. But this gap is closing. Before we know it, revenue from internet advertising should be on a par with radio.The challenge for media owners is to understand how their consumers are using, and are going to use, these new outlets and to adapt their content accordingly. Take Big Brother. It has become both a huge money- spinning and ratings-boosting franchise for Channel 4, extending from old media to new, from its main terrestrial channel to multichannel and interactive TV services, mobile applications, CDs, books and videos.Given all the false starts and investments that did not pay, media and entertainment companies need to look carefully before developing diversification strategies that work. Having looked at how media companies around the world successfully diversify revenues, we can offer the following:First, objectively and robustly define the opportunity by evaluating the fit of any new media venture with your existing business, in terms of both its economic logic and the implementation risk.Second, take a hard-headed view of your in-house capabilities and resources. Third, take decisions about how to enter these new markets - should you partner or go it alone?And, finally, develop proper investment cases to weigh up the risk/reward potential.The levels of internet penetration, multi-channel digital TV and broadband usage are rising. Increasingly, audiences are looking for the brands they know, delivered how, where and when they want them. Not being there for them is becoming less and less of an option for all media owners.paul.zwillenberg@occstrategy.comPaul Zwillenberg is a partner in the media practice at OC&C Strategy Consultants in London
