A glossy postcard announced that the novel was an Oprah’s Book Club pick; Stephen King defied anyone to read the first seven pages and not finish the book; Don Winslow called it “a Grapes of Wrath for our time”.Of all the books published each year, only a very few will receive this sort of care, planning and marketing. From the summer of 2019, American Dirt was signposted as a major work of fiction. I’m glad I read the book before the furious debate began over whether a white American novelist with some Puerto Rican ancestry had done justice to the stories of migrants struggling to reach and cross the US-Mexico border.American Dirt is easily summarised. Lydia Quixano Pérez, a bookstore owner, has to flee Acapulco with her eight-year-old son Luca after her husband is murdered by drug cartels. Lydia and Luca join the migrants boarding La Bestia, the trains to the north, and face terrifying challenges.It has the breathless pace and tone of a soap opera; Cummins is not John Steinbeck, and American Dirt is as far from being this generation’s Grapes of Wrath as I am from being Gigi Hadid. The plot moves with electrifying twists and turns, the characters are separated into heroes and villains, neatly identifiable and rarely shaded in grey.If you know nothing about the long history of migration in the region, the book is a useful explainer — it delivers up the messiness of migrant struggles and US border tensions in a neat package. But if you’re a migrant, if you know more, you might understand the fury of critics such as the Chicana writer Myriam Gurba, who called American Dirt “trauma porn that wears a social justice fig leaf”.It seemed to me, as an outsider to the US and to Mexico, that Cummins had the best of intentions, but that she wrote as a well-intentioned outsider to the lives of many of her characters, who are rendered one-dimensional. The reader is never in doubt that the novel will end on a note of epiphany, as soap operas and telenovelas must.That same week, I read Deepa Anappara’s Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line. I approached it first with caution, wondering if this was another Indian novel mining poverty as its source material, but then with deepening delight. This story features nine-year-old Jai and his friends, slum-dwellers in a smoggy, unnamed city that resembles Delhi, who form their own “djinn patrol” to investigate the unnerving disappearances of other slum children.Jai is a wonderful narrator, fully imagined — “I’m scared of JCBs, exams, djinns that are probably real, and Ma’s slaps” — and in Anappara’s hands, his world takes shape with care yet without sentiment, from the ghost of the ragpickers’ boss to the fear that bulldozers will raze their homes.Anappara is in her forties, and made her debut late as a novelist; as a journalist she has worked on the impact of poverty on children, and brings both knowledge and respect to her fiction. Her characters are free to make terrible mistakes, unshackled to the necessity of a neat ending.Part of the power of literature is that anyone can write anyone else’s stories. This generation’s debate over cultural appropriation is a fresh version of an older argument about postcolonial literature — do you have a right to tell those stories? And, as novelist and essayist Alexander Chee asks, “Why do you want to tell this story?”To these questions, I would add one more: can you be sure that you fully inhabit and empathise with the lives of people whose race, or class, or caste, backgrounds and life experiences, are vastly different from yours? If so, go ahead; if not, proceed with care.Much of the anger around American Dirt and its reputedly large advance has to do with unequal power in the publishing marketplace. Some critics have asked why a non-Mexican writer should profit when major publishers in the US have historically ignored Latino authors who tackled the same subjects. Both Cummins and her critics claim to have faced threats, as the argument grows ever more heated on and offline.Novelists should have the right to tell other people’s stories — but they don’t have a right to be uncritically reviewed. None of us want to say to another author that as a non-Mexican, she can never write about Mexicans; or that if you are Hindu, you can’t write about the Christian or Muslim experience; none of us wants to shut doors.And yet the writer’s job is also to be aware of your own limitations — can you do justice to experiences so far outside your own? Cummins earnestly explains the lives of migrants, in a wildly melodramatic but ultimately unconvincing novel; Anappara took me effortlessly into the alien world of a slum in an Indian metropolis, and helped me see it through a child’s eyes.Anyone can try to tell someone else’s stories. Getting it right is much harder than it seems, and if you take such a risk, expect also to take the flak.Follow Nilanjana on Twitter @nilanjanaroyJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Cafe.

Some are going so far as to declare the arrival of an industrial recession.While the Fed appears unlikely to let that stop its well-flagged move to raise rates for the first time since 2006 there are signs that concerns about the dollar and the industrial economy are likely to influence what it does after that.“It is something that makes us more cautious in terms of raising rates,” Ms Yellen, the Fed chair, said earlier this month of the strong dollar and its drag on the economy.The messages emerging from the US industrial heartland remain pretty stark.At WW Grainger, an Illinois-based industrial supply company which sells everything from lightbulbs to electric motors and safety gear, sales in the US are down 5 per cent on last year with government purchases the only segment offering any growth. The company has been warning investors for months that it is facing a “tough industrial economy” which may last into 2016.At Fastenal, which similarly relies on supplying the industrial sector, management has gone a step further. “The industrial environment is in a recession,” Fastenal’s chief financial officer told analysts on an October conference call.It is a really tough time here now. In many of our markets we are back to 2009 levels again, which is a story you are not really reading aboutFor Cummins, the diesel engine maker, a collapse in US demand for trucks has added to the woes it was already facing from the slowdown in big emerging economies such as Brazil and China and forced lay-offs.“It is a really tough time here now,” Tom Linebarger, Cummins’ CEO, said in a recent interview. “In many of our markets we are back to 2009 levels again, which is a story you are not really reading about.”Those sorts of anecdotes translate into a broader view across US manufacturing that the Fed may be pulling the trigger too early if it raises rates now.In a recent survey by the National Association of Manufacturers, 55 per cent of companies still considered the US economy too weak to raise rates before 2016. Less than a third thought the time was right.“There clearly is a sense that this [a Fed hike] is going to happen,” said Chad Moutray, NAM’s chief economist. “But there still is a lot of nervousness out there about what that means.”Much of the focus in the lead-up to the Fed move has been on strong employment numbers — where the big growth has been in professional and other services — and inflation that is creeping back up towards the Fed’s 2 per cent target rate.But the data on America’s industrial sector have been far less encouraging. Industrial production, new figures for which will be released on Wednesday, has contracted in three of the last six months while the Institute of Supply Management’s latest monthly survey of factory orders pointed to a US manufacturing contraction.Behind those figures are the strong dollar and falling US exports which saw US companies export $15bn less in October than at their all-time high in July 2014.Jason Furman, chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, predicted on Tuesday that net exports would “continue to be a headwind” in 2016. “It is more likely to be taking something off our growth rate rather than adding to it.”While the Fed has traditionally shied away from talking about the dollar, Ms Yellen and other senior Fed officials have been increasingly willing to acknowledge the importance of foreign exchange movements explicitly.Stanley Fischer, vice-chair of the Fed’s board of governors, has dubbed the dollar upsurge since the summer of 2014 a “sizeable shock”. Lael Brainard, another Fed governor, said this month it would take a 1 percentage point cut in the federal funds rate to insulate US employment from the effects of a 15 per cent strengthening in the inflation-adjusted exchange rate. Given rates were already near zero, this implied delayed lift-off and a shallower path of future hikes, she added.The comforting fact for the US economy may be that its industrial sector and exports are now less important than they were. Manufacturing makes up only 12 per cent of US gross domestic product. Exports of goods and services represented 13 per cent of GDP in 2014, a far smaller share of output than in other OECD countries such as Germany.Still, the woes of US manufacturers are real and will weigh on Fed policymakers’ minds.Kevin Logan, an economist at HSBC, argues the impact of the strong dollar is likely to be a more cautious path forward for the central bank. US GDP has risen by 2.2 per cent over the past four quarters. But, if the drag from the decline in net exports were stripped out, it would instead have expanded by 2.9 per cent, he estimates.“It suggests to me that the Fed is not going to be very aggressive in the coming year,” he said.

Shares in Eli Lilly, which have gained 25 per cent so far this year, rose 5.4 per cent to $86.50.Merck shares climbed 2.9 per cent to $54.57 after the drugmaker was also upgraded to “overweight” from “equalweight”, and the price target on the stock was lifted to $66 from $64.Concerns about competition for Merck’s arthritis drug Remicade, which accounted for 5.7 per cent of its 2014 sales, and Januvia, part of its successful diabetes franchise, were overdone, said Mr Meecham. He also noted that while its pipeline of new drugs were not blockbusters, “they add up and are nearly free at the current valuation”.That helped push the S&P 500 pharmaceuticals industry index higher by 2.3 per cent.Pharma and biotechs were under selling pressure earlier this summer as high drug prices charged by some companies attracted political scrutiny. Mr Meacham said: “We view it more as election season rhetoric than a push toward near-term structural changes.’’Shares in Yum Brands climbed 2.7 per cent to $74.48, after analysts at Cowen upgraded the stock from “market perform” to “outperform” and raised their price target on the stock to $88 from $77.Earlier this year, Yum, the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, announced plans to spin off its China division, which accounted for about half of the company’s revenue in 2014. Slowing economic growth and food safety scares hurt the company’s efforts to turnround sales in the region.With Yum’s reorganisation “on the horizon”, investor focus is expected to shift from concerns on China to optimism for Taco Bell, according to Andrew Charles, an analyst at Cowen.“Outside of China, Yum’s highly franchised business model provides stability that can more predictability return more than 10 per cent annual growth after three years of missing targets,” he said. He also expects Yum to discuss plans to return cash to shareholders through share buybacks at its December investor meeting.Cummins shares fell 7.9 per cent to $92.43 after analysts at Bank of America cut the engine manufacturer to “underperform” from “buy” and lowered their price target on the stock to $90 from $115.Shares in mining equipment maker Joy Global fell 13.2 per cent to $13.33, after analysts at Bank of America downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “neutral” and cut the price target by more than 52 per cent to $10.Overall, the S&P 500 was led higher by gains in financial and health care stocks.By markets close, the S&P 500 gained 1.1 per cent to 2,102.63, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 17,888.35. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9 per cent to 5,156.31.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
3;CMI;Cummins Inc;2015-08-14T23:24:03Z;India recruits private sector executives to head state bank reforms;Infosys director appointed as Bank of Baroda chairman;"India has named private sector managers, including former senior executives at Microsoft and Citigroup, to oversee reforms of some of the state-controlled banks that dominate the country’s financial sector.Ravi Venkatesan, a 51-year-old director of information technology group Infosys and former chairman of both Microsoft and Cummins in India, was named chairman of Bank of Baroda on Friday. Baroda’s new chief executive is P.S. Jayakumar, who previously worked at Citi and has been managing director of housebuilder Value and Budget Housing Corp.Unveiling details of how India’s state banks would be recapitalised and encouraged to improve their efficiency after years of rising bad loans, finance ministry officials also raised the possibility of bringing private sector bankers into the middle ranks of public sector banks hitherto run by bureaucrats.“In the last few years, they [public sector banks] have faced a challenging situation,” Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. “Even though a challenging situation did exist, there’s no cause for panic at all.”State banks have dominated Indian finance since lenders were nationalised under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the 1960s, and they now control 70 per cent of assets.But they have in several cases been poorly managed and plagued by corruption. Their bad and “restructured” loans (credits rolled over for borrowers) have together now reached 14 per cent of their assets after heavy exposure to the troubled sectors of steel, power, electricity distribution, roads, textiles and sugar.After months of consultation with the banks led by Jayant Sinha, Mr Jaitley’s deputy, the government of Narendra Modi, the prime minister, has announced a series of reforms and a scheme to recapitalise the state banks with Rs700bn over the next four years.The money will be injected each year in tranches, with the aim of rewarding successful banks and forcing the others eventually to shrink their market share.In the current financial year for example, 40 per cent of the Rs250bn to be allocated will be shared among banks to ensure that all reach the required capital adequacy ratio of 7.5 per cent of assets in accordance with Basel III norms; a further 40 per cent goes to the six biggest state banks vital to the economy, including State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda; and the remaining 20 per cent will be distributed based on each bank’s performance.In a further sign of the government’s attempts to make state banks more competitive with private sector rivals, they will be henceforth be judged on “key performance indicators”, including quantitative targets such as return on equity and the proportion of fee-based income and subjective ones such as the level of skill development.Most of the 27 state banks are listed, but the government has at present no plan to privatise them fully or even cut the government’s stake in any of them below half because it would require legislation difficult to push through parliament. Mr Sinha has raised the idea of consolidation but says each bank’s board must decide its own strategy.India Ratings & Research, part of Fitch, said in a report this month that the government’s planned injection of Rs700bn for the state banks would probably fall short of what was needed.It said “public sector banks will need Rs930bn, which is equivalent to an equity writedown of about 1.7 per cent of the banks’ risk weighted assets, and represents the loan haircut that banks may face to revive the financial viability of distressed accounts”."

Some of the state’s largest employers have expressed concerns, including pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, engine manufacturer Cummins and Salesforce, the tech company.Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, said on Twitter that the $43bn company is “forced to dramatically reduce our investment in (Indiana) based on our employees’ and customers’ outrage” over the bill. He said the company would cancel “all programmes that require our customers/employees to travel to Indiana to face discrimination”.Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, has said that the Indiana law sends the “wrong signal”. “Indianapolis strives to be a welcoming place that attracts businesses, conventions, visitors and residents,” he said in a statement Wednesday.Mr Ballard’s comments point to how for many companies — including Starbucks, Google and Alcoa — and the politicians seeking to attract their business, same-sex marriage and gay rights are often both moral issues and business imperatives.In recent days, three major conventions have threatened to pull out of the state because of the bill. The organisers of Gen Con, the city’s largest convention, said the law “will have a direct negative impact on the state’s economy, and will factor into our decision-making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years”.The resistance in Indiana comes roughly a year after Republican Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a similar bill under pressure from Delta, American Airlines, Marriott International and Apple. Arizona’s Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, also opposed the bill, saying it was bad for business.Nineteen states have adopted so-called “religious freedom” bills gradually since 1993, when a similar federal statute was passed. But the last two years have seen a flurry of activity in Nevada, Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Texas and other states as social conservatives seek to respond to a string of court victories for gay marriage proponents that has swiftly led to marriage equality in 37 states.Many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government actionThe Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments about gay marriage bans on April 28 and is likely to decide their legality by this summer.The tension reveals a rift between the Republican Party’s traditional big business interests and more religiously conservative small business owners, says Les Lenkowsky, who served in the George W Bush administration and worked closely with its office of faith-based initiatives.“Big (particularly publicly traded) businesses feel that they need a wide variety of stakeholders — they’re in some ways quasi-public entities, whereas small businesses feel they are private entities,” said Mr Lenkowsky.
5;CMI;Cummins Inc;2014-04-22T23:00:06Z;Plan to equip buses with F1 technology boosted by UK auto funding;;Proposals to use Formula One technology to make buses and diggers use less energy are among the first funded under a £1bn scheme to make the UK a world leader in environmentally friendly vehicles.The funding is part of a broad government strategy designed to keep the UK car industry at the forefront of new technological developments, and continue its spectacular rebound from close to collapse to rude health over the past decade.Led by a resurgent Jaguar Land Rover and investment in British plants by Nissan, Toyota and BMW, the industry has defied a prolonged and painful decline in the wider European automotive sector by increasing its focus on technology and high-end vehicles.Four energy-efficient projects will receive a total of £28.8m in grants to support investments of £133m, business secretary Vince Cable will announce on Wednesday, as part of a 10-year funding commitment unveiled last year that the government says could secure up to 30,000 jobs in the industry.Global carmakers are under increasing pressure from regulators to develop viable, long-term replacements for combustion engines and reduce their carbon dioxide emissions.The UK’s recent boom in car production – from less than 1m cars built in 2009 to an estimated 2m in 2017 – has protected jobs and brought in billions of pounds worth of investment but has relied heavily on producing more premium, powerful, oil-fuelled cars, such as the Mini and JLR’s Range Rover, not low-emission, green vehicles.The government hopes its cash injection will help make the UK a hotbed of research into new technologies, which could include electric motors and hydrogen-powered engines.“The next generation of cars, buses and diggers will be powered by radically different technologies and I want them to be developed here in Britain,” Mr Cable said. “These projects will be the first of many to receive funding . . . to turn technologies into products.”As part of the first tranche of funding under the umbrella of the government’s Advanced Propulsion Centre scheme, component manufacturer GKN will receive funding to develop a system borrowed from Formula 1 cars to allow buses to store energy while braking. JCB will also develop a similar system to recover energy from hydraulic arms on its yellow diggers.The two other grants were awarded to US carmaker Ford, to upgrade its highly successful, low-emission EcoBoost engine, and Cummins, the engine maker. Another £75m worth of grants will be available in the second round of allocations this year, Mr Cable will announce on Wednesday.The government’s targeted support for the car industry, which mirrors similar initiatives to promote the aerospace and pharmaceutical sectors, comes as industry executives fret over an acute skills crunch, especially in the country’s supply chain, which lags behind European rivals such as Germany and France.
6;CMI;Cummins Inc;2013-09-20T15:09:48Z;Guest post: is there an “Africa”?;;"By Jonathan BermanIt was 1996, and Sam Jonah knew he was in trouble.Jonah was chief executive of AngloGold and had just led the company’s listing on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the first African company on the Big Board. He was on a routine follow-up roadshow when the Rwandan genocide filled the airwaves, and Jonah spent much of the next year explaining that his company had no operations in Rwanda. “Most investors then still thought Africa was a country,” he recalls, “one country. And once Rwanda hit the airwaves, we were all Rwanda.”Today, fewer experienced international investors or managers would confuse Jonah’s native Ghana with Rwanda. Most would recognise that the language, region, geography, resources and governance of the two countries are deeply distinct, and that Ghana and Rwanda are only two of 54 African countries (55, depending on who’s counting). Both Africa and those doing business there benefit from a better understanding today of Africa’s many and diverse parts.But if you look only at Africa’s parts, and not Africa as a whole, you’ll miss it. It’s one of the more surprising conclusions from spending much of the last year talking about Africa’s growth with some of the top chief executives succeeding there.The most obvious reason to consider Africa as a whole is economies of scale. Tom Gibian is among the pioneers of private equity in Africa. His firm ECP began investing in Africa in 2000. “In Africa, you can’t be a little pregnant,” Gibian says. “The Asian shipping lines and logistics firms saw this early on. Their business just didn’t work if they had to give up their manifests for last-mile transport. Once they decided they were coming to Africa, they were all in. They made sure they could transport to every major port.Gibian continues: “The same is true in my business. We found that, to build a world-class private equity business, you couldn’t go small. To attract the right capital and world-class talent, you had to do the whole continent.”Tim Solso of global power leader Cummins had a similar perspective, especially in regard to talent. Like ECP, Cummins has a whole-of-Africa strategy. Solso was chief executive when the strategy was developed. When asked why he didn’t focus on a couple of big national markets or one regional market, he replies it was “Never an option. My goal was to move the needle for Cummins. It had to make sense from that perspective.”Solso also found that a continental vision helped to attract the talent Cummins needed to succeed. “The guy I asked to lead us in Africa is a phenomenally capable talent in our organization, and was previously leading distribution in Asia. For him to come and attract the team he wanted, the opportunity had to be big: all Africa.”Africa can seem disintegrated. Its intraregional trade is only 12 per cent of its total trade, the smallest of any global region. But that figure belies the trend. First, it measures only formal trade and even those who gather the statistics say that nearly half of total trade is informal. Second, trade strengthening programs are being driven in each of Africa’s five active regional trading blocs. Most ambitiously, negotiations began in 2012 to combine three of these blocks (COMESA, EAC and SADC) into one trading region. This “Cape to Cairo” meta-trade zone may be a long time coming, but its advance to the negotiating table is inarguably the result of a trend towards integration.Inward investors like ECP and Cummins are certainly beneficiaries of that trend. But the real drivers of it are internal to Africa. An emerging set of competitive African companies and their leaders are displacing a prior model of African competitiveness based on single-market dominance and rent-seeking. Companies like Togo’s Ecobank, the South African telecoms giant MTN and the Kenyan communications firm Scangroup have the financing, systems and management to compete across borders, rather than rely on them for protection.While it makes sense to consider Africa’s trading blocks and countries distinctly, some of the most widely held distinctions among Africa’s regions are in fact blurring. Consider the most common division of all: north Africa from the rest of Africa. Nearly every international organization, including all the Bretton Woods organisations, measure and manage their affairs in north Africa in complete isolation.But is it in isolation? Consider the experience of Morocco’s Attijariwafa Bank, which has pursued a distinctly Southern growth strategy, acquiring banks in Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, and Togo. Attijariwafa is not alone. Both of Morocco’s leading construction firms are pursuing Africa growth strategies, as is leading Algerian conglomerate Cevital. Asked if he thinks of himself as African, Attijariwafa’s chief executive Mohammed El Kettani says warmly “Yes, always. In the early 1900s, part of the family went south to Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire and they did business there for forty years and built up wealth and then returned to Morocco. My wife’s parents also spent many years in Mali and Cote D’Ivoire, trading. My eighty-five year old mother-in-law speaks Wolof (a tribal language of Senegal) to this day.”Perhaps it is not surprising that the one international financial institution that reflects Kettani’s reality clearly is the one closest to it – the dynamic African Development Bank, which covers all of Africa.It is surely a mistake to view Africa as one place, but it is as much of a mistake to view it as no place at all. It’s an identity brought home to me recently by Scangroup chief executive Bharat Thakrar. Bharat spoke while doodling idly, not looking down. “Very few Africans can trace the outline of their country. But we all know what Africa looks like,” he said. Still looking at me, Bharat slid over the table a perfectly rendered outline of Africa.Jonathan Berman is the author of Success in Africa: CEO Insights from a Continent on the Rise (Bibliomotion, September 2013)Related reading:

7;CMI;Cummins Inc;2013-09-19T16:54:51Z;Fed lets opportunity knock for more debt;Companies announce new wave of bond sales;A new wave of corporate debt issuance could follow a surprise move by the US Federal Reserve to maintain its asset purchases at current levels.Widespread expectations that the central bank would begin to taper its bond buying this month appeared to hearken the end of an era of record low corporate borrowing rates, which has fuelled a boom in debt issuance.But analysts said the Fed’s unexpected decision on Wednesday, which sent benchmark rates sharply lower, would provide a further incentive to companies seeking to lock in long-term financing.Corporate borrowers including US-based engines manufacturer Cummins, life and health insurance provider Reinsurance Group of America, freight car management company TTX, as well as banks such as Citigroup and Union Bank, have announced new debt sales in the wake of the Fed’s announcement.A flurry of new debt offerings also hit European and Latin American markets on Thursday with Telecom Italia, Swisscom and Chile’s Embotelladora Andina among companies announcing debt deals.More companies are expected to follow in the coming days, analysts said.“A new window of opportunity has just opened up for corporate borrowers,” said Ed Marrinan, head of macro-credit strategy at RBS Securities.“The considerable drop in yields after the Fed’s announcement, in conjunction with the stealth appetite investors have been showing recently, bodes well for a full pipeline of bond sales.”The market for both investment grade and high-yield dollar bonds could be hit by billions of dollars in additional supply, Mr Marrinan said.The pick-up in offerings follows a slowdown in the last couple of months in anticipation to the Fed’s taper.More recently, many borrowers also refrained from raising funds through bond sales as Verizon flooded capital markets with a record $49bn debt sale.Yields on the benchmark 10-Year US Treasury note, which move inversely to prices, fell as much as 17 basis points to 2.67 per cent immediately following the release of the Fed’s FOMC announcement.The 10-year note yield stood at 2.73 per cent on Thursday.In addition to spur a new wave of sales, the rise in bond prices may also help improve the outlook for returns on fixed income securities, analysts said.Corporate bonds have fallen in the last couple of months with funds investing in fixed income securities experiencing large redemptions.The declines left investors facing their first negative year of performance since 2008.Year-to-date total returns on corporate bonds stood at minus 3.1 per cent on Thursday, according to Barclays indices. At the start of the week, the return on the bonds was minus 4.1 per cent.“The outlook for total returns on fixed income has certainly improved,” said Rick Rieder, co-head of Americas fixed income at BlackRock.“The Fed is forcing rates down again. Not only we will see a lot of issuers starting to come to markets now but it may also contribute to the overall improvement in many investment grade portfolios. It will definitely help many bond funds.”
8;CMI;Cummins Inc;2013-08-02T13:50:59Z;Weak economy forces Eaton to cut forecast;;"Shares in Eaton Corporation fell 5.5 per cent after the diversified industrial company, which is heavily exposed to emerging markets, cut forecasts for the year, citing weak global growth.The company, which last year completed an $11.8bn takeover of Cooper Industries, said it was cutting its forecast for full-year earnings from a range of $4.05 to $4.45 to a range of $4.05 to $4.25.Eaton is the latest of several large US industrials to cite the challenges of a weak global economy in its second-quarter results. Caterpillar, the maker of mining and construction equipment, blamed the worldwide mining downturn when it cut its outlook for the second successive quarter. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, also said on Tuesday that 4 per cent revenue declines outside North America had partially offset 7 per cent increases in the region.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, said the 38 per cent increase in second-quarter revenue, to $5.6bn, reflected 40 per cent growth from acquisitions and a 2 per cent decline in “core sales”, reflecting “soft conditions” in several of the company’s end markets.Net income was up 29 per cent compared with last year’s second quarter to $494m, while diluted earnings per share – which were depressed by the shares issued to purchase Cooper – declined 7 per cent to $1.04.Mr Cutler said Eaton had entered 2013 expecting the year to be one of “subpar” global economic growth, leading to approximately 2 to 3 per cent growth in the company’s markets. It now expected global growth of about 1 per cent.Growth in the company’s home US market had also been less focused on the company’s core industrial products than on consumer products, cars and housing, Mr Cutler said. Industrial production in the second quarter had risen only 0.1 per cent, he pointed out.“It wasn’t capital goods; it wasn’t new manufacturing plants,” Mr Cutler said. “We continue to believe that we are going to see a year where industrial production in the US will be less than GDP growth. That’s a difficult environment.”Mr Cutler added that, in the companies two biggest segments – which make electrical control equipment – demand had been strongest in the US, Middle East and Latin America and weakest in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Growth in those segments would now be about 2 percentage points lower than expected, he said.The key emerging market economies – China, India and Brazil – were “struggling to get traction”, Mr Cutler said.“They’re not growing at the rates we saw before the recession,” he said.The company’s hydraulics division fared still worse, experiencing sales growth of just 1 per cent to $772m, as a 9 per cent core sales decline and a further 1 per cent decline from currency effects all but wiped out a 10 per cent increase from acquisitions. The division’s operating profits fell 15 per cent to $104m.The shares closed down 5.5 per cent at $66.06 in New York."
9;CMI;Cummins Inc;2013-02-11T15:43:06Z;Immigration cap drags on US manufacturing;;When President Barack Obama delivers his state of the union address on Tuesday night, he will present a vision for economic growth that revolves around the once-glorious manufacturing sector, saying he wants to make the US a “magnet for jobs and manufacturing”.But in the American heartland, US companies are struggling to recruit the engineers and researchers they need to innovate and remain globally competitive. There are not enough US-born candidates for these jobs and not enough visas for highly skilled foreigners.“If we’re going to be successful going forward, we’re going to continue to need to have access to the best skills in a higher volume than we can access just out of the North American market today,” says Gwenne Henricks, chief technology officer at Caterpillar, the Illinois-based equipment maker, which employs 10,000 engineers and technologists worldwide.Mr Obama has made immigration reform a priority of his second term and any comprehensive effort would necessarily involve more H1B visas for highly skilled workers, especially in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) fields.The H1B issue has long been associated with Silicon Valley and tech companies have been pressing for an increase in the number of such visas available.But often overlooked is the importance of the issue for manufacturing companies, such as Caterpillar and Cummins, the engine maker headquartered in Indiana.“This is not just an issue for Microsoft and Intel, it’s an issue for the American heartland,” says Neil Ruiz, an immigration expert at the Brookings Institution. “There are a lot of companies that need specialist skills, especially in Stem fields, and they just can’t find them locally so they have to search globally.”Manufacturing . . . [is] not the dirty shop floor that people once thought it was, it needs innovation to survive and thriveThere has been broad support from both parties for increasing the number of H1B visas allocated each year. A bipartisan group of senators has proposed raising the cap on highly skilled private sector workers from 65,000 to 115,000 a year. It would also remove the cap on visas given to workers with graduate Stem degrees, which is at present set at 20,000.Last year, the cap was reached in 10 weeks, although in more robust economic times it was made in days. Businesses complain that the caps are artificial and bear no relation to labour market demand.A report by the US Chamber of Commerce and two other groups last year found that 26 per cent of workers in Stem fields with PhDs were born overseas and that Stem fields with high percentages of foreign workers had low unemployment rates for Americans with the same speciality.Previous research had shown that each person who graduates with an advanced Stem degree and stays in the US creates on average 2.62 jobs for American workers.But increasing the number of H1B visas could be dependent on agreement in Congress on much thornier issues, including legalising undocumented immigrants and border security.“We expect to hire thousands of engineers over the next five to 10 years and it’s quite possible that many of them will be born outside the US,” says Lorrie Meyer, executive director of global talent management at Cummins. “So to have the flexibility for us to be able to employ them here would really let us plan and get rid of some of the uncertainty that we face today.”President Barack Obama assembles a new team for his second term in the White HouseThe issue affects businesses across the spectrum, says Joe Trauger, vice-president of human resources at the National Association of Manufacturers.“It does reach across the entire manufacturing sector, it’s not just a tech company issue,” Mr Trauger says. “This is borne out by the fact that manufacturing has changed a lot over the last couple of decades. It’s not the dirty shop floor that people once thought it was. It needs innovation to survive and thrive.”Comprehensive immigration reform is among the top issues preoccupying manufacturing companies, with 82 per cent of the manufacturing companies surveyed by NAM saying they have a medium to serious problem finding the right skilled workers.Manufacturers say there have been numerous cases in recent years where they have had to let go of employees or pass over potential recruits because they could not get the necessary papers for them, or transfer employees back to their home countries, even though it might not make the best business sense.Some Caterpillar employees from China and India have been waiting more than eight years for a green card that would give them permanent residency.Manufacturers are now hoping for an immigration deal that would increase the caps and link H1B visa availability to demand, and would repeal the per-country limit on green cards.“We’d like to see an exemption for employment-based green card petitioners working in the Stem fields and an increase in the number of employment-based green cards that are issued annually,” says Ms Henricks. “This isn’t just our dream, it’s our need.”Ms Meyer says that hiring the best candidates for a job, wherever they were born, would ultimately be good for the US economy.“It makes us more competitive in the global economy if we can employ people from a variety of backgrounds, cultures and languages because we do business around the globe,” she says. “As we grow globally, we grow domestically because we have research and development here that is supporting our business needs around the globe.”
10;CMI;Cummins Inc;2012-11-01T21:28:15Z;Industrials lead Wall Street higher;;Industrial companies led Wall Street higher on Thursday as positive manufacturing data and fresh stimulus measures from China helped to boost US equities.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 1,427.59 as investors looked to put the weather-related shutdown of the US market on Monday and Tuesday behind them.The S&P 500 industrials index advanced 1.8 per cent to put it among the top rising sector groups in the week’s second trading session. Investors welcomed a survey of US manufacturing activity that showed production in the sector increased in October at a faster pace than expected.That report from the Institute for Supply Management came after the day started with news that China’s central bank pumped $60bn into the world’s second-largest economy this week to support infrastructure investments. Meanwhile, manufacturing data out of China also suggested reason for investor optimism after an important survey said activity in October rose to a four-month high.Masco Corp, the maker of home improvement and building products, rose 6.9 per cent to $16.13. Cummins, the diesel engine manufacturer, moved 5.5 per cent to $98.75 and Joy Global, the maker of mining equipment, gained 5.7 per cent to $66.03.“Broadening manufacturing is one of the pillars of economic growth, along with advancing corporate confidence, which still remains a head wind,” said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “But the market’s attention right now is on the strong US manufacturing number, which bodes well for the next quarter of corporate earnings.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 1 per cent higher to 13,232.62. Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, rose 3.4 per cent to $87.65.US equities were also bolstered by two pieces of labour market data, ahead of Friday’s important non-farm payrolls report. The labour department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell to 363,000, ahead of market forecasts. Meanwhile, private sector payroll processor ADP said 158,00 jobs were created in October, up from 88,000 a month earlier.Mr Cote said: “The focus is now squarely on Friday’s jobs report, which has serious implications on the course of the upcoming presidential election.”LinkedIn shares closed 0.1 per cent lower to $106.85, but it was set to open higher after rising more than 5.7 per cent in after-market trading. The business networking site reported third-quarter results ahead of the analyst forecasts.Starbucks, the coffee chain, finished 1.6 per cent higher to $46.62. The company was also set to open higher on Friday as it reported robust earnings and was up more than 6 per cent in after-market trading.Troy Alstead, Starbucks chief financial officer, said the storm would not have a meaningful impact on its results for the current quarter, noting that most of its stores had reopened and some had become sources of power and sustenance for people affected.The upbeat sentiment among investors on Thursday also helped to lower Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the CBOE Vix index. The measure of implied volatility on S&P 500 options contracts has climbed as US equities have retreated since touching their highest point of the year in September. But the Vix was 10.3 per cent lower to 16.7 on Thursday.CBOE Holdings gained 4 per cent to $30.66 as the US derivatives exchange operator said trading volumes in Vix futures reached record levels in October.Technology sector stocks on the S&P 500 rose 1.8 per cent as chipmaker and micro communications companies saw gains. JDS Uniphase Corp, the fibre optics manufacturer, climbed 8 per cent to $10.48. Micron Technology, the semiconductor maker, rose 6.6 per cent to $5.78. Intel Corp, the chipmaker, moved 2.9 per cent higher to $22.26.The Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.4 per cent to 3,020.06. Shares in Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, gained 0.2 per cent to $596.54.Visa, the global payments company, moved 3.7 per cent higher to $143.88 after it reported a day earlier that net income almost doubled in its latest quarter. Rival MasterCard also reported robust results on Wednesday and advanced 1.7 per cent to $468.69 as US consumer spending boosted both card groups.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index was among the top rising sectors and advanced 1.3 per cent. Fresh consumer and retail data showed that same store sales in October rose 2.7 per cent in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.Abercrombie & Fitch, the retailer that targets teenage consumers, was 8.7 per cent higher to $33.23. Fossil, the watchmaker and leather goods retailer, gained 7.8 per cent to $93.88.
11;CMI;Cummins Inc;2012-10-16T12:01:42Z;Chinese slowdown a drag on US earnings;;The slowdown in the Chinese economy shows no clear sign of ending and has become a drag on US manufacturers’ earnings, according to industry executives.While Barack Obama and Mitt Romney spar in the election campaign over how to respond to China’s economic strength, US chief executives are more worried about its weakness.“I’ve been covering the industrial sector for 10 years now and I don’t remember when people have ever been as bearish as they are now,” says Shannon O’Callaghan, an analyst at Nomura.Recent statements from companies such as Alcoa, the aluminium producer, and Cummins, the engine maker, have highlighted the impact of China’s slowing growth on demand for their productsBusiness linked to the faltering construction sector, in particular, have been seeing a sharp slowdown in growth or even contraction.Even after intensive efforts by US manufacturers in recent years to build up their Chinese businesses, they typically earn only about 5-15 per cent of their revenues from China. But last year, at a time of anaemic US recovery and crisis in Europe, it often made a more valuable contribution to growth.In the round of third-quarter earnings reported over the coming couple of weeks, it will instead be a source of concern.Greg Hayes, chief financial officer of United Technologies, the industrial group that owns Otis lifts and Carrier heating and air-conditioning systems, last month described China as “a bright spot” compared with the US and the EU but said it had been slower than expected and was continuing to slow down.That experience is typical, according to Scott Davis, an analyst at Barclays Capital.“Most companies were expecting China to start its recovery by the second half of the year and it hasn’t happened,” he says. “If anything, it’s got a bit worse.”Companies including Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment manufacturer, and General Motors, the carmaker – which now sells more vehicles in China than it does in the US – have been reporting softer markets.When they look ahead to next year, prospects in China are critical.Talking to analysts last month, Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chief executive, said “when and how fast China starts to grow again” was “at the top of the list” of factors affecting the outlook.Mr Hayes at United Technologies had a similar view, saying: “If you do the math . . . 53 per cent of world growth next year comes from China. So if China slows more than we expect, it will present a challenge.”Some sectors are still relatively healthy. Giving a generally upbeat presentation to analysts last month, General Electric’s chief executive Jeff Immelt described China as “not that bad”.“They keep buying aircraft,” he said, and “healthcare is still pretty strong.”GE has been investing heavily in China and last year finalised an avionics joint venture with Aviation Industry Corp of China to supply the country’s aircraft industry.Like other US companies, it still believes that the country’s potential for economic development makes it vital to invest there.As David Joyce, chief executive of its aerospace division, put it: “We’re real bullish on China long term.”GM agrees. “There will always be ups and downs in the market. We pay more attention to the long-term growth potential in China,” it said in a statement.Even in the battered construction sector, there are segments with attractive prospects.Tyco International, the commercial fire protection and security group that emerged from the break-up of the industrial conglomerate of the same name at the start of the month, argues that as fire regulations are tightened in emerging economies it is well placed to benefit.“It is an emerging market in an emerging market,” chief executive George Oliver told the Financial Times. “It does take time but it will get to standards that protect property and save lives.”US companies are pinning their hopes on the effectiveness of the stimulus measures now being put in place by the Chinese government. Nomura’s economists believe China could surprise with stronger than expected growth in the fourth quarter.Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive of Alcoa, said last week he was “pretty confident” that Chinese demand growth would be picking up speed by the end of the year.When the economy does accelerate again, Mr Davis at Barclays identifies Emerson Electric and 3M as among the US industrial companies that stand to benefitHowever, Mr Oberhelman at Caterpillar is more cautious. “There will be a recovery,” he said last month. “It’s probably not going to be the step-back hockey stick [growth curve] we’ve seen every other time in China. But I’m convinced a year from now, we’ll see recovery in China, which will be helpful for us.”Additional reporting by Robert Wright
12;CMI;Cummins Inc;2012-09-10T19:02:42Z;Navistar responds in Icahn fracas;;The board of Navistar, the struggling US truckmaker, has accused activist investor Carl Icahn of mounting a campaign of “threats, attacks and disruption” after he said the board was “asleep at the switch”.Mr Icahn’s attack, published over the weekend, follows the appointment in late August of Lewis Campbell, a former chief executive of Textron, the diversified industrials group, as its new chief executive.Mr Icahn, the US’s best-known activist investor, called the appointment “worse than ill-advised” since the company had consulted him over it. Mr Icahn holds around 13.5 per cent of Navistar’s shares. Mr Icahn demanded that Navistar appoint four representatives of the company’s main shareholders to its board to oversee such strategic decisions.Navistar said that it maintained an “ongoing dialogue” with its shareholders. It went on: “As such, after a year of dialogue, we are extremely disappointed that Mr. Icahn has chosen to pursue his unproductive tactics of threats, attacks, and disruption rather than continuing constructive engagement, particularly at this important time for Navistar.”The board and management had a clear path forward, the company added, and were focusing on executing it.Mr Icahn had written in his letter about his grave concern for Navistar, which he said had become “a poster child for abysmal business decisions and poor corporate governance”. He accused the board of having stood idly by as Navistar’s share of sales of Class 8 trucks – the heaviest category – had fallen over the last two-and-a-half years from 25 per cent to 15 per cent.“I am led to the inevitable conclusion that Navistar is a company with a board asleep at the switch,” Mr Icahn wrote.At the heart of many of Navistar’s problems has been its struggle to develop a new engine meeting the latest US environmental protection agency guidelines for emissions levels. On September 6, Navistar reported net income of $84m for the quarter to July 31 – but would have reported a significant loss but for an exceptional income tax benefit of $196m.Mr Campbell said then that the company was “not pleased” with the results but was satisfied to learn on day one in the job that Troy Clarke, chief operating officer, and his team had plans to deal with the issues the company faced.Navistar has said it plans to solve its engine problems by offering various engines from Cummins, the diesel engine maker, in certain models, starting from December.Navistar’s shares fell 3 per cent to $23.99.
13;CMI;Cummins Inc;2012-08-29T20:30:00Z;US equities inch up after GDP revision;Industrials hit by poor global economic outlook;Joy Global shares reversed their morning losses in afternoon trading on Wednesday although the mining machinery maker lowered its full-year earnings forecast on a weak global economic outlook.The company reduced its guidance, saying that the market outlook would be lacklustre due to low US growth, economic contraction in Europe and decelerating growth in China.The stock fell as much as 5 per cent after the market opened but closed 2.6 per cent higher to $54.43. The company also reported a 11.5 per cent rise in third-quarter net income compared with a year ago.Shares in the company, however, have plunged 32.7 per cent over the past year.A decline in production of US coal and the closure of higher-cost coal mines in Australia and Russia have also hampered the company.Stephen Volkmann, analyst at Jefferies, said: “The weaker operating results are consistent with the general decline in end markets as mining capital expenditure declines and commodity production softens. The weak market outlook and lowering of guidance will weigh on shares. [But] low valuation of the stock could provide some support.”Mr Volkmann maintained a “hold” rating for Joy Global and set a 12-month target price of $55.Other industrial stocks edged higher. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenues, added 0.1 per cent to $86.09 while Cummins, the engine maker, increased 0.8 per cent to $97.70.The industrials index was one of the weakest performers, dropping fractionally. Six of the 10 S&P sectors recorded gains.The defensive telecommunication index was the forerunner, adding 0.7 per cent.AT&T rose 0.5 per cent to $36.82 and its rival Verizon gained 1 per cent to $43.09.Overall, the broader market inched up on Wednesday after revised data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that gross domestic product was at 1.7 per cent from April to June, exceeding initial estimates of 1.5 per cent.The S&P 500 added 0.1 per cent to 1,410.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up fractionally to 13,107.48 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index edged up 0.1 per cent to 3,081.19.Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said: “The Fed is not going to sit on its hands with economic growth below 2 per cent and the unemployment rate stuck above 8 per cent. Data over the next couple of weeks and the labour report covering August that is due to be released on 6 September will probably determine the Fed’s course of action.”James Russell, head of equity strategy at US Bank Wealth Management said: “Despite negative momentum in current fundamental trends, equities are trading higher since early June on the basis of anticipated effective global central bank actions. [But] a lack of clarity or substance [of support] by the Fed and the European Central Bank later this week is likely to represent a disappointment to investors.”Closely-watched technology stocks were mixed. Apple, the most heavily-weighted stock on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, edged down 0.2 per cent to $673.63. Google moved up 1.6 per cent to $688.01 as it planned to expand the Google Plus service further into the corporate world.Yelp shares were actively traded, surging 22.5 per cent to $22.37 as its post-initial public offering lock-up period expired with 52m shares supplied to the market.Facebook fell 1.2 per cent to $19.10.Victor Anthony, analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, said: “We concede that the shares [of Facebook] could remain range bound for several months as the lock-ups expire. The additional supply against a backdrop of a market that is pricing in risk for Facebook and against weak demand for the shares could continue to weigh on the share price.”Elsewhere, WellPoint rose 7.7 per cent to $61.80 after the healthcare group said the departure of Angela Braly, its former president and chief executive officer, would not affect the acquisition of Amerigroup, the US health insurer.Phillip Seligman, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, was positive on the planned appointment of a new chief executive, saying: “Angela Braly’s departure was urged by several large investors disappointed with the company’s performance …reflecting difficulties in forecasting medical costs and setting premium prices, as well as its member losses.”HJ Heinz fell 2.3 per cent to $56.12. The ketchup maker reported its first-quarter net income increased 14 per cent to $258m from a year earlier. Shares in the company rose as much as 3 per cent in the previous trading session after its chairman said quarterly results were better than expected.
14;CMI;Cummins Inc;2012-08-02T21:49:43Z;Navistar shares stall over SEC probe;;Shares in Navistar, one of the biggest US truckmakers, plunged 13 per cent after the company said it was the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into “accounting and disclosure matters”.The beleaguered manufacturer, which said on Thursday that it was “co-operating fully” with the probe, also withdrew its full-year earnings forecast until the release of its third-quarter results in September, but said it expected to post an adjusted pre-tax loss of $80m-$115m in the third quarter.In addition, Navistar said it would borrow $1bn from four banks “to improve its financial flexibility”. It said the five-year, senior secured term loan from JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse would also help it pay down debt. Moody’s this week downgraded Navistar’s credit rating to B2 from B1 and said its outlook was negative.The announcements prompted a sell-off of Navistar’s shares, which have already lost half their value over the past year as it has struggled to win approval for its proprietary clean emissions technology. The manufacturer’s stock price, which was trading at close to $60 just over a year ago, closed at $21.52.Much of Navistar’s predicament relates to its decision to develop alternative technology in an attempt to meet stricter US emissions standards. For more than a decade, the manufacturer has worked on a system to capture exhaust fumes and pass them through the engine a second time, burning pollutants and reducing emissions.However, that approach – which cost the company some $700m – has failed to meet clean emissions rules. Last month, Navistar instead adopted the technology used by its competitors, which uses liquid urea to cut nitrogen oxide emissions.The company said on Thursday it had struck a deal with Cummins, a big US engine maker, to help it meet US emissions standards. Some Navistar vehicles will offer Cummins engines from January, while Navistar will work to make its own engines cleaner using Cummins’ urea-based technology.The decision to adopt more third-party engine technology may be a sop to activist investors, who have put pressure on the company both to sell itself and to buy competitors’ engines while focusing more on truckmaking.Navistar adopted a “poison pill” plan in March to prevent outsiders from gaining a stake of more than 15 per cent in the company. Carl Icahn, Franklin Resources and MHR Fund Management are all large shareholders.“The actions announced today establish a clear path forward for Navistar,” said Dan Ustian, chief executive. “We expect to return to profitability in the fourth quarter and believe the company will be in a position to improve margins in 2013.”However, the SEC investigation casts a cloud over the company. “The inquiry places another risk factor on the company that is difficult to measure,” wrote Andy Kaplowitz, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, in a research note.Navistar has been troubled by accounting problems before. It fired Deloitte & Touche, its longstanding auditor, in 2006 and restated its earnings for 2002-2005, revealing that it had underpaid taxes and had not set enough aside for pension liabilities.
15;CMI;Cummins Inc;2012-07-12T17:54:15Z;US domestic stocks beat multinationals;;Shares in domestically focused US companies are outperforming those of multinationals on New York’s benchmark S&P 500 index by the most in a year.The divergence reflects fears among equity investors that the slowing global economy will impair the earnings of many S&P companies that rely on overseas sales, particularly given the dollar’s strong rally against the euro since March.In recent weeks a string of multinational companies have warned about lower second-quarter earnings, among them Advanced Micro Devices, Cummins and Procter & Gamble. The second-quarter earnings season is expected to show the weakest expansion of profits since the same quarter of 2009, while the dollar has gained nearly 9 per cent against the euro since the start of the second quarter.Within the S&P 500, 122 companies depend on overseas operations for more than half their sales and this basket of stocks has dropped 2.1 per cent in the past month, according to Bespoke Investment Group.By contrast, 121 companies in the S&P regarded as domestically based have gained 3.6 per cent in the past four weeks. Since the start of the year, such domestic stocks are up 8.7 per cent, while multinationals are in negative territory, down 0.1 per cent.“The spread between the two baskets has really widened in recent days to its highest levels in a year,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “It is still early in the earnings season, but as of now investors want nothing to do with multinationals ahead of their second quarter reports.”The weakening euro could hurt foreign earnings for US companies.“Companies with revenues in Europe saw their profits dented when they tried to convert their transactions into dollars,” said Quincy Krosby, financial market strategist at Prudential Financials.Moreover, the US economy is still growing at a much better rate than the eurozone, boosting the appeal of companies with a domestic focus. “There is still growth in the US, albeit anaemic, while the slowdown in Europe and China has lowered demand in those regions,” said Ms Krosby. “So, we have seen reallocation from mega caps to US-oriented companies.”Investors have sold shares in AMD and DuPont, for example, over the past two weeks on worries about lacklustre sales in Europe and China.AMD, the second-largest PC microprocessor maker in the world, slumped 11.2 per cent on Tuesday after the company warned that revenue was expected to drop 11 per cent for the second quarter. Shares in DuPont, the US chemical company, have declined 8.4 per cent over the last three months.Bespoke showed that the best performing domestic companies over the past 12 months included the US discount stores, such as Ross Store and Dollar Tree. The other group of forerunners were the homebuilders, such as Lennar Corp, D.R. Horton and PulteGroup as the recent positive housing data suggested the bottoming in this sector.Barclays analysts have cut estimates across a wide range of sectors exposed to global growth, including industrials and technology.“Equities are likely to respond poorly,” said Barry Knapp, a US equity strategist at Barclays. “Although the declines to the second- quarter earnings are clear, we think the fallout from Europe [with its] impact on US growth have yet to be felt.”
16;CMI;Cummins Inc;2012-04-26T21:08:04Z;GM chief’s pay triples to $7.7m;;The pay of Daniel Akerson, General Motors chief executive, tripled to $7.7m last year, but the company has warned that US government restrictions on executive pay could limit the carmaker’s competitiveness.Mr Akerson took home a base salary of $1.7m plus $5.9m in stock and cash related to the company’s stock price, GM said in a proxy statement filed on Thursday. The company had targeted a total package of $9m but that was reduced by a 45 per cent fall in GM’s stock last year. In 2010, the year he took charge of the company, Mr Akerson earned $2.5m.By comparison Alan Mulally, Ford’s chief executive, was awarded a package worth $29.5m in 2011, making him the best-paid executive among Detroit’s “Big Three”. Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat and Chrysler, earned $19m in stock and salary last year, but none of that came from Chrysler, the company has said.GM said that Mr Akerson’s pay package placed him in the lowest quarter of executives among a grouping of large multinational companies including Ford, ExxonMobil and General Electric.GM executives’ pay is limited by the US government, which still owns about 30 per cent of the carmaker following its $50bn bailout in 2009. The US Treasury has frozen 2012 pay at 2011 levels for GM, AIG and Ally Financial, the last three companies bailed out at the height of the financial crisis that have not repaid their loans. GM still owes the Treasury $23.4bn.The company said in its proxy statement that the pay limits may cramp its competitiveness and potential growth.“Recognising and rewarding these key contributors and competing with other large, multinational employers to attract and retain fresh talent with critical skill sets is extremely difficult within the compensation constraints imposed” by the government, GM said.“Our ‘pay-for performance’ compensation philosophy would ordinarily allow us to reward the executives responsible for our superior performance in 2011 on a more targeted, competitive basis than what has been prescribed by [government] regulations.”GM’s net profit almost doubled to a record $7.6bn last year on the strength of its US sales, which offset losses in its troubled European business.The highest paid GM executive in 2011 was Thomas Stephens, the chief technology officer who retired earlier this month and earned $8.3m. Stephen Girsky, the chairman of Opel tasked with turning around GM’s European performance, earned $5.3m.GM also said on Thursday that it was nominating James Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the oil company, and Theodore Solso, former head of Cummins, the engine maker, to its executive board.“Mr Mulva’s expertise in the energy industry will provide valuable insight to our board in developing GM’s long-term strategy,” the company said.
17;CMI;Cummins Inc;2012-03-20T20:45:58Z;US stocks retreat from recent highs;;Renewed concerns about China’s economic outlook and some disappointing domestic housing market data undermined the mood on Wall Street and drove the S&P 500 down from a near four-year high.The benchmark equity index dropped 0.3 per cent at 1,405.52 as energy and industrial stocks were gripped by a bearish warning from BHP Billiton, the mining group, that Chinese demand for iron ore was “flattening”.The S&P 500 energy and industrial sector indices, which were down 1.4 and 1.1 per cent on the day, dragged the main US index away from its highest closing price since May 2008. However, the S&P 500 is still up more than 11 per cent from the start of the year.“Overall, the market is up 30 per cent from its lows in the late summer of last year but a little consolidation is expected,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING. “The fact that we are holding 1,400 is a good sign and we’ve bounced off lows. There are still many investors who are underweight and we are not too concerned by a small retrenchment on a given day.”Commodity-related stocks were among the worst performers. Joy Global, the mining equipment maker, was the biggest faller among industrials, dropping 4.3 per cent to $75.92. Cummins, the diesel engine manufacturer, fell 3.6 per cent to $123.42.Peabody Energy, the coalminer, dropped 5.4 per cent to $31.64 and was the worst performer in the energy sector. Alpha Natural Resources, another coal supplier, lost 4.1 per cent to $16.61.Markets also reacted to news that US housing starts slipped by 1.1 per cent to 698,000 last month as analysts continued to express concerns over the prospects of a housing market recovery.“Housing starts are expected to rise 9 per cent this year, with single-family construction rising 8 per cent and multi-family starts rising 12 per cent,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo.“Overall, starts should rise an additional 16 per cent in 2013. Even with these gains, however, homebuilding remains well off its long-run trend.”The S&P 500 financials index bucked the weaker trend in the wider market, rising 0.4 per cent to lead the major sector indices on strength from the country’s largest banks.Bank of America, which dispelled rumours that it was considering a share offering to raise additional capital on Monday, led the way higher. Shares in the bank, which said last week it would not return capital to shareholders after passing the Federal Reserve’s stress tests, rose 2.9 per cent to $9.81.Goldman Sachs rose 1.4 per cent to $126.02, while JPMorgan was up 0.4 per cent to $45.38 on reports that the bank will pay $150m to settle a lawsuit with three pension funds. Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $20.41 and Citigroup rose by 2.5 per cent to $38.08.Tiffany & Co, the luxury jewellery retailer, was the best performing stock in the S&P 500. Tiffany’s rose by 6.7 per cent to $73.27 as the company upped its annual profit forecast to $4.05 a share, driven by surging sales in Asia.Williams Company, the natural gas explorer and producer, was among the day’s biggest risers and gained 2.9 per cent to $31.30. The company’s subsidiary, Williams Partner, said it would acquire a natural-gas pipeline system for $2.5bn from Caiman Energy.The Nasdaq Composite Index recovered some of its losses earlier in the day and finished down just 0.1 per cent to 3,074.15. Apple, the largest US company by market value, retreated from a record close achieved after it said it would begin paying a dividend on Monday, only to surge to yet another record high. The stock fell below the $600 mark in early trading only to finish up 0.8 per cent to $605.96Amazon, the online retailer, rose 3.7 per cent to $192.33 a day after it said it would acquire Kiva Systems, a warehouse robotics company, for $775m.Adobe Systems, the largest maker of graphic design software, fell 3.9 per cent to $33.16, as the company said profits for the second quarter would come in below estimates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent to 13,170.19. Earth mover Caterpillar led Dow fallers on the back of the market’s concerns over China. Shares in the company fell by 2.6 to $110.76.United Technologies, the building systems and aerospace equipment maker, fell by 1.6 per cent to $83.26.Walt Disney, the entertainment group, fell 0.5 per cent to $43.24 after the company said it would incur a $200m writedown on John Carter, which cost $300m to produce.
18;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-12-02T02:15:28Z;Obama launches energy efficiency drive;;An initiative intended to create tens of thousands of jobs in projects to improve the energy efficiency of US commercial buildings is being launched by President Barack Obama, kick-starting an initiative first launched in the 1990s.The administration has secured commitments from companies including General Electric, Alcoa, 3M and Cummins, the cities of Denver and Sacramento, universities and other groups to back two energy-saving initiatives valued at a total of $4bn.The programmes, which do not require new legislation or any commitment of taxpayers’ money, are supported by the US Chamber of Commerce, a frequent critic of the administration. They are being announced on the same day that monthly jobs data are published, throwing the spotlight on the persistently high rate of unemployment.White House officials said they have not made their own estimates of the likely employment impact of the programmes, but said the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst had suggested more than 50,000 jobs could be created.The Chamber of Commerce quoted a study from Oak Ridge National Laboratory that suggested 40,000 jobs annually could be created, although that was for a larger programme worth $80bn over 15 years.Mr Obama said in a statement: “Upgrading the energy efficiency of America’s buildings is one of the fastest, easiest and cheapest ways to save money, cut down on harmful pollution and create good jobs right now.”He added: “We can’t wait for Congress to act.”The programme includes two elements: a $2bn initiative to save energy at federal agencies and a further $2bn of commitments from the private sector to invest in energy-efficiency projects.The federal agencies will use energy savings performance contracts, under which private-sector companies commit to installing energy-saving equipment at no upfront cost to the government and are then paid back from the reductions in utility bills. The private companies guarantee the level of savings.The latest news and analysis on the world’s changing climate and the political moves afoot to tackle the problemAlthough the programme was first launched under Bill Clinton, and then given a further push by George W. Bush, it has made only slow progress.The Chamber of Commerce has for years been urging the administration to strengthen its commitment to the programme and welcomed Mr Obama’s move, while describing it as a “small step forward” that needed to be followed by “a leap …[to] adopt more common sense policies that will put Americans to work”.Thomas Donohue, president of the chamber, said: “This is a sure-fire way to create jobs and make our nation’s federal buildings more energy efficient, all without using a penny of taxpayer money.”Schneider Electric, a French-owned industrial group that employs 17,000 in the US and manufactures energy-efficiency equipment, said it had signed up to commit to make investments and cut its energy use to show it would “walk the talk”.Paul Hamilton, its vice-president of government affairs, said the first motive was financial.“Energy costs have to be managed just like every other input,” he said. “It’s part of being a competitive company.”

Up to a third of the crude refined by both companies is WTI.The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to 1,229.11, its second worst daily performance this month, after worse than expected house price data, and cautious trading ahead of Wednesday’s eurozone summit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.7 per cent to 11,706.7, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2.3 per cent at 2,638.42, back into negative territory for the year.Netflix shares plunged more than a third after the movie-streaming and DVD delivery service said domestic users fell by almost 1m during the third quarter – a larger fall than the company had predicted in mid-September.The stock fell 34.9 per cent to $77.37. The setback followed a tumultuous month, after the company increased the price of its joint DVD and streaming service by 60 per cent before announcing and then retracting a decision to divide the two units.Netflix’s market capitalisation has fallen by two-thirds since September 15, when the company first told investors it would lose subscribers.James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities, one of the few analysts who had maintained a “buy” on the stock through its stormy month, downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a “sell”.Goldman Sachs also dropped its “buy” rating on Netflix.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar plunged 25.3 per cent to $43.27 in just a few minutes of extremely heavy trading mid-afternoon, after the company announced the departure of its chief executive without explanation.Quest Diagnostic was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 10.9 per cent to $56.50, after the clinical testing company eked out positive earnings on stronger margins, despite falling sales. That helped Quest’s rival Laboratory Corporation of America rise 1.2 per cent to $84.07.Analogue semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments was down 2.3 per cent at $30.95, after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue estimate disappointed the market.An earnings miss and bleak fourth-quarter guidance from industrial conglomerate 3M hit cyclical industrial and energy stocks. 3M was down 6.3 per cent to $77.04, Cummins was off 5.1 per cent to $93.81, after the engine manufacturer also cut full-year earnings guidance, citing weak demand from China and India, and a strong dollar.Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations Illinois Toolworks fell 5.4 per cent to $45.65, after the company forecast weaker demand from Europe in the fourth quarter.AK Steel Holding shed 13.6 per cent to $7.47 after the company declared a loss of $3.5m or 3 cents a share.Coal miner Peabody Energy ended a volatile day down 3.1 per cent at $39.66. The stock fell as much as 8 per cent at the start of trading after ArcelorMittal pulled out of a joint bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal, leaving Peabody needing $5bn to fund the acquisition on its own.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Management used an earnings conference call to reassure analysts the company will be able to raise the finance through debt markets, rather than by issuing new equity, leading the stock to rally back towards $40.94 where it closed on Monday, before falling again.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Analysts had spent Tuesday morning debating the breadth of the current rally. Bespoke Investment Group found 90 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 were trading above their 50-day average at the close on Monday. That is the highest level since October 2010 and suggests the rally has extended beyond large-cap stocks, multinationals and high dividend payers, which led the two previous rallies since the August slump.But fund flows into exchange traded funds appeared to suggest the opposite, with $900m withdrawn from funds targeting small-cap companies.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, also played down the strength of quarterly results. Aggregate earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded consensus expectations by 5.4 per cent. But excluding financials, the margin has been 1.9 per cent, which is below the 5.3 per cent margin in the second quarter and the 6.1 per cent margin in the first quarter.
20;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-10-25T13:31:50Z;Manufacturers warn of slump in demand;;Two of the US’s biggest manufacturers cut their full-year outlooks, warning of slumping demand in both the developed world and emerging economies.Third-quarter profits at 3M, one of the US’s biggest industrial conglomerates, missed Wall Street expectations and the company slashed its outlook for full-year earnings, as sales of consumer electronics dropped, reflecting what the company said was “generally slowing economic growth in the developed world”.Cummins, one of the world’s biggest engine-makers, also cut its full-year outlook, citing a sharp drop-off in demand in emerging markets. “Government actions to reduce inflation in India and China have resulted in softer near-term demand than we previously expected,” said Tom Linebarger, who will take over as chief executive in January.Mr Linebarger warned in an interview with the Financial T imes this month that the US and much of Europe may already be in recession while demand was dropping sharply in emerging markets.3M’s exposure to consumer markets and its role as components supplier to other manufacturers also makes its performance something of a leading indicator, typically experiencing customer trends 3-6 months ahead of some rivals.Cummins is also seen as something of an industrial bellwether. Its engines power popular cars such as Dodge’s Ram trucks, large mining and construction vehicles, and are also widely used in power generation.Both companies earn most of their revenues outside the US, making them vulnerable to the cost of translating foreign profits back into US dollars at a time when that currency is particularly strong.“This is the reverse side of having almost 70 per cent of your sales outside of the US,” said George Buckley, 3M chief executive.Mr Buckley said the company had been hit by the European sovereign debt crisis and the sharp drop in orders for LCD televisions – for which 3M makes display enhancement films – among retailers and distributors as they reduced inventories in anticipation of slowing consumer demand.He said mobile devices were increasingly eclipsing TVs and predicted that segment of the business would play an ever-diminishing role for 3M.3M reported net income of $1.09bn or $1.52 per share in the third quarter, down from $1.1bn or $1.53 per share in the same period last year. The company reduced its expectations for full-year earnings to $5.85-$5.95 per share, from its previous guidance of $6.10-$6.25.Cummins reported quarterly profit of $452m or $2.35 per share, up from $283m or $1.44 per share, a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street expectations of about $2.25 per share. However, that was mainly due to a a lower-than-expected tax rate. The company cut its full-year sales forecast to $17.5bn-$18bn from its prior guidance of $18bn, below analysts’ predictions of $18.1bn.Shares in 3M were trading 4.6 per cent lower by late morning in New York at $78.38. Cummins was down 5.6 per cent at $93.33.
21;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-10-16T13:26:23Z;US and Europe ‘may be in recession’;;The US and much of Europe may already be in recession while demand is dropping sharply in emerging markets, the head of one of the US’s biggest manufacturers has warned.In an interview with the Financial Times, Tom Linebarger, who will take over as chief executive of Cummins, one of the world’s biggest engine-makers, in January, said he expected the next six to nine months to be a highly uncertain time for the global economy,“Europe could drive another global recession pretty easily,” he said. “Some of the countries in Europe are already in a second recession or will be shortly. That could get a lot worse.”“The US is much in the same spot,” Mr Linebarger added. “We’ll find out in three or four months if we’re already in recession but it wouldn’t surprise me to find out that the US is already in negative growth, once all the figures are adjusted, or we’re very close to that. I’m very concerned about that.“We’re seeing the effect in Europe on our business, though what worries me the most is the effect European problems will have on the rest of the world. The US is already weak. If Europe gets a bad cold, the US will get much sicker.”The Cummins chief said he was also worried about emerging markets, whose growth has boosted the manufacturer’s bottom line and is expected to make up an increasingly important part of its revenues in coming years. Three-fifths of the company’s revenues come from outside the US.“In China and India, their economies are doing well but inflation rates are high, so they’re cutting back on demand and raising interest rates to get inflation under control, which is hurting our markets,” he said. “All those things are near-term concerns of mine.”Cummins is seen as something of an industrial bellwether. Its engines power popular cars such as Chrysler’s Dodge Ram trucks, as well as large mining and construction vehicles, and are widely used in power generation.Mr Linebarger’s comments contrast with recent data that suggest that the US might avoid economic contraction this year, as well as with Cummins’ own projections for its growth in the next four years. Mr Linebarger explained that those targets were longer term, and that the company did not assume growth would be steady.“I don’t think the next six to nine months are going to be terrific, but if you look out over four or five years, I think it’s going to be good over that time,” he said. “We’ll be in volatility in different markets at some point over the next four years, but over the period I see significant opportunities for Cummins to grow.”The manufacturer expects its revenues to increase by an average of 14 per cent a year to 2015, with about half the growth coming from emerging markets.Mr Linebarger said that would be driven by infrastructure development, tighter emissions restrictions and partnerships with emerging market manufacturers seeking to expand their sales globally.He said concerns about the reliability of energy supplies in developing countries would also boost Cummins’ power-generation division.
22;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-10-03T20:43:45Z;Cummins chief upbeat over growth;;Fears about a global economic slowdown have been overblown and governments and the media are “too pessimistic”, according to the head of the world’s biggest independent maker of diesel engines.Tim Solso, chief executive of US-based Cummins, told the Financial Times that while there was “a lot of uncertainty” because of difficult economic conditions in some countries, companies such as his had “tremendous opportunities” for worldwide growth.“I believe governments and the press have been too pessimistic about what’s happening in the economy,” Mr Solso said. “While I recognise the concerns about excessive public debt in Europe and the US, we [at Cummins] are probably experiencing greater opportunities for expansion than ever before.”Cummins plans to recruit 4,000 more employees next year, mainly engineers, on top of hiring a similar number this year that brought the total workforce to about 44,000. The company’s engines are mainly used in trucks, construction machines and power generation systems.It is also maintaining its goal of increasing annual sales from $13.2bn last year and an expected $18bn this year to $30bn by 2015.Mr Solso said at the root of his optimism was demand in developed and emerging economies for renewing infrastructure such as roads and railways. This in turn required spending on hardware such as excavators and other building machines.Also there was a continued need to add to energy supplies, especially using new generations of diesel engines that minimise the output of carbon dioxide and other polluting gases.One of the US’s most experienced industrial managers, Mr Solso is stepping down as chief executive at the end of the year after 11 years in the job.Of Cummins’ 8,000 new employees, the group expects 40 per cent to be hired in India, China and Africa, and the rest in countries including the US, UK and Brazil.“It’s important for a company like Cummins to add to its technical strengths because we continually need to adapt our engines to meet more onerous requirements over pollution control and fuel efficiency,” Mr Solso said.Of Cummins’ envisaged sales growth in the next four years of an average 14 per cent a year, Mr Solso said “about half” would come from emerging economies such as India and China. It was important, however, not to play down the opportunities for pushing up sales in developed nations too – partly because of the need to add new vehicles to truck fleets after several years of underinvestment.
23;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-09-13T21:15:23Z;Return to fundamentals helps S&P 500;;No big news from Europe was good news for Wall Street on Tuesday, as the S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to 1,172.87, its second-best day of September.Although an Italian bond auction attracted record yields, public comments by Angela Merkel confirming Germany’s commitment to help Greece were enough to quash rumours of a Greek default for now.That allowed US investors to focus on fundamentals for a change, and some of the biggest stock price moves were driven by earnings or forecasts.Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, missed analyst expectations on second-quarter profit figures and cut its full-year earnings forecast. Falling sales of televisions and mobile phones were to blame. Best Buy shares fell 6.5 per cent to $23.35.Cummins, an engine manufacturer, was up 5.9 per cent at $92.20, after company executives used an analyst meeting to forecast sales growth of 14 per cent to $30bn by 2015.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.4 per cent at 11,105.85 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.5 per cent to 2,532.15.Although fundamentals played some part in trading, it was yet another day when every sector of the S&P 500 moved in the same direction.S&P 500 sectors are currently 97.2 per cent correlated, according to analysis from ConvergEx Group.This is in addition to correlation among the 250 largest individual stocks in excess of 80 per cent, the highest level since the 1987 stock market crash.“The correlations we note among industry sectors are profoundly and dysfunctionally high. They come, in my opinion, from the underlying concern over a second financial crisis,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx.Energy stocks were among the laggards of the S&P 500, rising only 0.3 per cent, as oil-linked stocks were hit hard.“In the last few days refiners have seen a substantial narrowing in their product margin, as the spot price of finished petroleum and diesel products has fallen,” said Paul Cheng at Barclays Capital.Mr Cheng also said the narrowing premium in the price of Brent over WTI oil is hurting US refiners. A few Midwestern refiners buy WTI oil, which has been trading at a discount to Brent crude for the past year. As the discount narrows, those refiners face higher input costs.Tesoro Corporation, a big refiner, was down 1.3 per cent at $23.47. Marathon Petroleum was also off 3.6 per cent at $35.34. Other analysts said the sell-off in energy stocks was a reaction to fears about global growth, stemming from Europe. Oil explorers and producers were down too, even though the oil price rose Tuesday, with Denbury Resources falling 1.8 per cent to $13.96.Industrials outperformed on Tuesday, up 1.9 per cent as a sector in the S&P 500.Logistics and distribution groups Fastenal, up 4.7 per cent at $34.35, and WW Grainger, up 3.7 per cent at 157.27, had strong days. WW Grainger had announced 10 per cent rise in quarterly sales on Monday.Southwest Airlines, the budget airline, rose 4.4 per cent to $8.31.That left the S&P 500 higher on two days running for the first time this month. But investors were cautious. “Expect the index to keep trading in bands with 1,250 an absolute maximum, unless the situation in Europe is resolved,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Coca Cola Enterprises, the European arm of the soft drinks giant, was up 3.7 per cent at $26.46, as investors reacted favourably to an analyst day in Paris on Tuesday. UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala upgraded the stock to buy, but acknowledged the company faced challenges, in particular from falling demand in Europe and rising input costs due to surging commodity prices.Coke’s “valuation [is] now interesting”, Nomura analyst Ian Shackleton told clients. But he maintained a “hold” rating, telling clients: “We see the stock still being held back by macro issues for now.” Credit Suisse said the company is set to benefit from a “step-change” in UK sales due to advertising for the London Olympics next year.Micron Technology, up 2.6 per cent at $6.86, registered its sixth successive day of gains. Tristan Gerra, semiconductor analyst at RW Baird, said the semiconductor group’s strong performance was due to signs that the spot price for DRam computer memory, Micron’s main product, may have bottomed.
24;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-07-26T21:04:58Z;New York stocks down on debt worries;;US stocks stumbled for a second straight session on Tuesday as investors waded through a heavy volume of quarterly earnings reports amid continuing anxiety over the US federal debt limit.The S&P 500 stock index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,331.94 in New York.The benchmark was weighed down by the industrials sector, off 1.9 per cent, and materials, which declined by 1 per cent, while technology shares offset the gloom.Illinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, ended the day down 8.2 per cent at $52.34 after profits missed analysts’ forecasts. 3M, which produces goods from Post-it notes to stethoscopes, dropped 5.4 per cent to $89.93. Paccar, the maker of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, fell 10.7 per cent to $45.02 after profits disappointed analysts,United Parcel Service, the global package shipping company, declined 3.3 per cent to $71.59. While second-quarter sales beat expectations thanks to price increases and a continued recovery in its supply chain business, chief executive Scott Davis noted that high US unemployment was braking demand for services and imports.Mr Davis also warned of ill effects from the political stalemate over raising the $14,300bn federal debt ceiling in Washington. The US Congress showed little progress towards a compromise before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.On Monday, Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, and John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, offered separate plans to resolve the borrowing limit issue.The White House threatened a presidential veto of Mr Boehner’s legislation Tuesday.“To move significantly one way or another, we’re going to need news on a deal out of Washington. It’s just another check point you need to get beyond,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis points to 4.284 per cent, suggesting continued demand despite the political uncertainty.Janney Montgomery Scott noted the situation seemed to have strengthened correlations among asset classes. “Given that the traditional safe haven asset class, Treasuries, is the source of capital markets uncertainty, we can expect this relationship between risk assets and Treasuries to remain off-kilter until Washington better wraps its hands around the debt ceiling and deficit problems or the government faces a credit event,” the broker-dealer said.Not every industrial stock lagged. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, rose 3.9 per cent to $110.82 after surpassing profit expectations. Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, rose 1.9 per cent to $80.82 as sales rose and executives raised their outlook for the year.Ford Motor lost 1.8 per cent to $12.94 after announcing a drop in second-quarter earnings. The Detroit-based carmaker said that pre-tax operating profit and cash flow for the year as a whole would be higher than in 2010.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,501.30.Second-quarter results have revealed a “pretty good earnings season so far”, said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems. Through Monday, almost a third of the 500 companies in the S&P index had reported quarterly numbers, and 83 per cent had beaten Wall Street estimates of earnings per share, he said.“The sector where we have seen the biggest surprise is in the technology sector,” he said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite held its ground, closing 0.1 per cent lower at 2,839.96.Broadcom, which makes chips for wireless devices, jumped 9.4 per cent to $38.20, after issuing a positive revenue outlook. Lexmark International, which supplies computer printers, gained 17.7 per cent to $33.93. Texas Instruments rose 0.3 per cent to $31.57, though executives foreshadowed a lacklustre holiday season.However, Netflix, the DVD and online video streaming service, tumbled 5.2 per cent to $266.91 after warning that a recent price rise would prompt some customers to downgrade or cancel subscriptions.The company, which was reporting second-quarter results, also indicated that revenues would “only grow slightly on a sequential basis” following the price change, which separates DVD and streaming into different subscription packages.After the New York market closed, Amazon reported second-quarter net profit of $191m, or 41 cents per share, sliding from $207m, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected the online emporium to earn 34 cents per share.
25;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-07-08T21:16:38Z;Wall St tumbles on disappointing jobs data;;Financial stocks led the way down in the final session of a choppy week on Wall Street as weaker-than-expected employment numbers dashed hopes that the “soft patch” in the US economy was coming to an end.The S&P financial index was down 1.3 per cent at the close, but the energy, industrial and technology sectors were not far behind as investors dumped riskier assets after the disappointing employment data.BB&T suffered the most in the financial sector, losing 3.3 per cent to $26.09. Bank of America was down 1.9 per cent to $10.71, despite news that it had reached a deal to sell its Balboa Life Insurance unit to Securian Financial, a US provider of insurance and retirement plans.In the wider market, the S&P 500 index was down 0.7 per cent at 1,343.81, although the measure was still up 0.3 per cent over the week.The losses were prompted by news that the US economy had added only 18,000 jobs in June, which was well below the 105,000 expected by economists.“This is terribly disappointing news,” said Brett Hammond, senior economist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management. “It is easy for the markets to shrug off one month of bad data, but this is two months in a row now,” he said.The negative reaction to the data were particularly acute due to strong ADP employment numbers in the previous session, which had raised hopes that Friday’s data would be strong.The ADP report showed that 157,000 private jobs had been created in June, ahead of the 95,000 expected, causing many analysts to revise upwards their expectations for the official number.This raising and then dashing of hopes left cyclical stocks sharply lower in the session after gaining on Thursday.In the industrial space, Caterpillar was down 1.1 per cent to $110.41 despite news that China’s regulator had approved its acquisition of mining equipment firm, Bucyrus International.Elsewhere, Cummins was down 1.9 per cent at $106.77 while the S&P industrial index was 1.2 per cent lower.The worst performing stock on the S&P 500 index was JDS Uniphase, which fell 4.6 per cent to $15.94. The S&P technology index was down 0.5 per cent, paring some of its 9 per cent gain over the past two weeks.The best performing sectors were defensives. The S&P utilities index was down 0.3 per cent while the telecommunications sector fell 0.3 per cent.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was up 1.6 per cent at 16.21.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent at 12,657.05, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,859.81. But in spite of these losses, the indices were up 0.6 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, over the week.Before the losses on Friday, the Dow was just 0.7 per cent short of a three-year high and Nasdaq was less than 0.1 cent away from a ten-year peak. These near-records came after two weeks of gains on Wall Street as investors began thinking the recent soft patch in the US – which pushed stocks down more than 7 per cent from the start of May to the middle of June – was finally coming to an end.The ADP employment data on Thursday appeared to strengthen the bullish case, causing a “risk on” trade. Investors were also looking to position themselves for a healthy earnings season, which begins on Monday when Alcoa reports.But the data on Friday left investors wondering if the strong 5.9 per cent rebound in the last two weeks may have been premature.“Hopefully, with supply disruptions related to the Japan earthquake and tsunami fading, and oil prices off their peaks, the labour market will perk up again,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.“If not, it is going to be an uglier second half than most anticipate,” he added.In corporate news this week, News Corp was in focus as the furore over allegations of phone hacking at one of its British newspapers escalated. The stock was down 7.3 per cent at $16.75 over the week, as the paper in question was closed down and some speculated that News Corp’s proposed takeover of BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, could be in jeopardy.Target, the discount retailer, was one of the best performers this week, adding 6.7 per cent to $51.14 after reporting strong retail sales numbers.
26;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-07-05T21:00:41Z;Wall St flat after strong rally;;Shares in Southern Union jumped as the bidding war for the pipeline operator escalated while the wider markets remained relatively flat as investors paused for breath following the strongest rally for two years last week.Shares in Southern Union were up 4.3 per cent to $42.10 after Energy Transfer Equity agreed to take over the Texas-based group in an $8.9bn deal – significantly more than the $7.9bn that it had agreed on last month.The higher offer follows a bid two weeks ago by Williams, another natural gas group, designed to break up the already agreed deal.Shares in Williams were down 0.2 per cent to $30.68 while ETE added 0.6 per cent to $44.93.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Zion Oil & Gas tumbled 17.6 per cent to $4.86 after the oil-and-gas exploration company said on Friday that there was little chance a well in northern Israel contained commercially viable hydrocarbons.But overall, the sector was up 0.5 per cent, one of the few to gain in a generally caution session, helped by a rise in the oil prices. Marathon Oil was up 3.4 per cent to $34.06 while Peabody Energy added 2.2 per cent to $60.69.But this failed to prevent the S&P 500 edging lower, losing 0.1 per cent to 1,337.88 as investors worried about which direction the markets would now turn after the 5.6 per cent jump in the S&P last week – the best week of gains in the index for two years.The index is now just 1.9 per cent away from a three- year high and is well above its 100-day moving average.Financial stocks were some of the worst hit by these nerves, also hurt by news that Portugal’s credit rating had been cut to “junk” and that Citigroup had cut its price target on a number of regional banks.Morgan Stanley was down 2.6 per cent to $23.15 while Comerica, a regional lender, lost 3 per cent to $34.32. The S&P financial index was down 0.8 per cent, paring some of the 5.9 per cent gains seen last week. The KBW banking index fell 1.2 per cent.The industrial sector was the next worst performing in the session, not helped by news that factory orders had risen by less than expected in May.Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters, led the losses, falling 5 per cent to $22.74 while Cummins declined 1.6 per cent to $105.69.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, paring some of the 6.4 per cent gains last week.But most of the remaining sectors on the S&P saw little movement and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,569.34. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent to 2,825.77.This pause follows the best weekly gains in two years on both these indices last week.The upswing came as the indices bounced up off their 200-day moving average and investors cheered a perceived improvement in the Greece situation.The markets were also looking ahead to the earnings season, which starts next week and is expected to be relatively strong.Analysts are expecting a healthy 11.9 per cent rise in earnings from the previous year for S&P 500 companies, according to data complied by Bloomberg. This would mark the seventh straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the index.But despite an assumption that second-quarter earnings would be healthy, there is some concern that guidances for the full year will be lowered due to the “soft patch” in the US economy over the past two months.Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, argued that the S&P 500 will reach a ceiling at 1,350 before running back down to 1,250 again in the coming months, thanks partly to lower guidances.But he goes on to argue that there will be a late rally towards the end of the year, which will see the S&P finish between 1,370 and 1,400. “In the end, the market wants to go up,” he reassured.In other company news Ameron surged 28.3 per cent to $85.05 after National Oilwell Varco said it would buy the fibreglass pipe manufacturer in a deal valued at $772m. National Oilwell Varco was up 2.2 per cent to $80.02.Netflix led the gains on the S&P 500, jumping 8.1 per cent to $289.63 after saying that it was expanding its video streaming service to 43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.Immucor, the biotechnology company, added 30.2 per cent to $26.99 after agreeing to be bought by private equity group TPG Capital for a fully diluted equity value of $1.97bn.Baidu, the US-listed Chinese search engine, was up 1.8 per cent to $145.87 on news that it will team up with Microsoft to create an English-language search.
27;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-07-01T20:30:24Z;Wall Street rally gathers pace;Rising optimism over economy;Wall Street saw its sharpest weekly gains in two years after better than expected manufacturing data buoyed risk appetite, helping the major indices achieve their fifth consecutive session of gains.The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.4 per cent to 1,339.67, led by the consumer discretionary, financial and industrial sectors, after strong data raised hopes that the US economy was coming out of the recent slow patch.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performing, led by Apollo Group, which jumped 6.4 per cent to $46.46 after the operator of for-profit schools reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings.Elsewhere in the sector, Darden Restaurants was up 6.1 per cent to $52.78 while Wynn Resorts added 4.2 per cent to $149.57.But the gains were broad based, with all 10 major sectors moving forward after the reading for the ISM manufacturing index came in at 55.3 for June. This was ahead of the 53.5 in May and better than the 52 expected by economists. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity.This number followed news on Thursday that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index had come in at 61.1, which was also well above economists’ expectations and raised hopes that the economy was improving after weeks in the doldrums.“This data are a strong sign we are coming out of the recent soft patch,” said Mark Lamkin, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist of Lamkin Wealth Management.This feeling on Wall Street lifted risky assets. The S&P financial and industrial sectors were up 1.7 per cent while the consumer discretionary sector added 2 per cent and technology stocks were up 1.7 per cent.Defensive sectors like consumer staples and telecoms were some of the worst performing, rising only 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Gains in the industrial sector were led by Cummins which put on 3.8 per cent to $107.42 while the technology sector was dominated by gains from Visa and MasterCard.The credit card companies continued to be lifted by news on Wednesday that the US Federal Reserve set a higher than expected cap on debit card transaction fees. Visa was up 4.4 per cent to $87.97 while MasterCard added 4.4 per cent to $314.47.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average index up 1.4 per cent at 12,581.86 and the Nasdaq Composite 1.5 per cent higher at 2,816.03.The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 5.4 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, over the week.The S&P 500 added 5.6 per cent over the five days, the best week on the index since July 2009. The Dow and the Nasdaq also saw their best week in two years.The only real downbeat news in the session was that the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence index came in at 71.5 for June, slightly short of the 72 reading expected and down from 74.3 in May, but the markets shrugged this off.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 4.8 per cent to 15.72, adding to the 21.7 per cent drop it had already seen this week as investors positioned themselves for a steady climb in the equity markets.The week on Wall Street kicked off in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the big indices bounced off key technical support levels reached the previous week after nearly two straight months of losses.The S&P 500 had fallen 7 per cent from the start of May, reaching a bottom at the end of last week. The index found its support level just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound that followed over the news five days was sharp, with the S&P index putting on around 1 per cent every session.The markets were helped by a partial resolution to the situation in Greece on Wednesday and then the stronger manufacturing data on Thursday and Friday. Investors were also positioning themselves for the upcoming earnings season – starting in earnest on July 11 – which is expected to be quite strong.In recent quarters markets have generally rallied before and during the earnings season as investors turn their attention away from macroeconomic concerns and on to companies news.This repositioning took form of a rotation into risk assets. The best performing sectors over the week were energy, which was up 7.2 per cent, technology, which added 6.8 per cent and consumer discretionary, which rose 6.6 per cent.One of the biggest pieces of corporate news from the session was the strong earnings results from Nike, which came as a relief to investors, who were concerned after the company missed expectations last quarter.Shares in Nike were up 13.1 per cent to $91.82.
28;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-06-30T21:02:08Z;Tech stocks lead gains on Wall Street;;Wall Street concluded the final session of a mostly depressed and volatile quarter on a positive note as upbeat economic data lifted sentiment and investors began to position themselves long in anticipation of a healthy forthcoming earnings season.The technology sector saw some of the strongest gains helped by First Solar, the largest solar power company by market capitalisation, which rose 2.2 per cent to $132.27 after it won $4.5bn in loan guarantees from the US department of energy for three projects it is developing in California.Elsewhere in the sector Hewlett-Packard was up 2.4 per cent to $36.40 while Intel added 3.6 per cent to $22.16. The S&P information technology index rose 1.4 per cent, adding to the 3.5 per cent gains earlier in the week.Ebay, the online marketplace which owns PayPal, rose 4.6 per cent to $32.27, benefiting from a number of ratings upgrades following news on Wednesday that third-party payment systems like PayPal will likely not be subject to new rules limiting credit charge transaction payments.These gains left the S&P 500 up 1 per cent at 1,320.64, adding to the 3.1 per cent gains earlier in the week and helping the index break through its psychologically significant 100-day moving average line.The rally was broad based, with all 10 big S&P sectors moving higher, as sentiment across the board was lifted by news that business conditions in the Chicago area had improved unexpectedly in June.The Chicago purchasing managers index rose to 61.1 this month, which exceeded the 54 reading that had been expected by economists and was up 4.5 points from May. A reading of more than 50 indicates expansion. The Chicago PMI is seen as a leading indicator for the national ISM factory index, due on Friday.The strong PMI data lifted the industrial sector in particular. Joy Global led the gains, rising 5.7 per cent to $95.24 while Cummins added 2.4 per cent to $103.49.The S&P industrial sector was up 1.7 per cent – the best performing on Wall Street – adding to the 2.9 per cent gains earlier in the week.The PMI news helped investors shrug off disappointing data from the labour department showing that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits was mostly unchanged last week, falling only 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 428,000.Investors were also unperturbed that Thursday marked the end of the Federal Reserve’s second round of quantitative easing, a $600bn bond-buying programme that has helped buoy the markets since the plan was floated last August.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent at 12,414.34, also helped by energy and material stocks as commodity prices ticked up. The index was up 0.8 per cent over the quarter and up 7.2 per cent over the year to date.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.2 per cent to 2,773.52, but was down 0.3 per cent over the quarter.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 5.4 per cent to 16.34 in the session as investors positioned for a steady climb in the equity markets.“A big part of what is driving the market right now is people positioning themselves for a strong earnings season,” said Rex Macey, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. The earnings season starts in earnest on July 11 when Alcoa reports.Stocks are also benefiting from the belief that the 7.2 per cent losses on the S&P from the May high to the June low has left the markets oversold.“The recent pull-back provides a buying opportunity,” said analysts at Citigroup. “Collectively we forecast double-digit gains for equity markets in second half 2011.”The second quarter on Wall Street started with a month of modest 2.9 per cent gains on the S&P, but then weak economic numbers on employment, manufacturing and gross domestic product left sentiment in the doldrums from the end of April until last week.The S&P 500 saw six straight weeks of losses from the start of May, the longest run of declines since June and July 2008. If not for a 0.04 per cent gain on week seven, the markets would have seen the longest run of weekly losses in a decade.But last Friday the big indices on Wall Street bumped into some technical support levels, convincing traders that the markets were oversold after such a long time in the doldrums. Sentiment has also been helped by some positive news out of Greece and expectations that the upcoming earnings season will be broadly positive.The S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent in the quarter, but was still up 5 per cent over the year to date.
29;CMI;Cummins Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Industrial groups raided in EU probe;;Several big industrial manufacturing groups confirmed on Friday that they had been raided by European competition regulators because of suspected anti-competitive practices in the piston engine market.Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment by revenue, said that its Perkins subsidiary in the UK had been visited by officials, as did Germany’s MAN. Both companies said that they were cooperating fully with the authorities.Competition officials at the European Commission announced on Friday that they had carried out the raids on the premises of a number of companies involved in the engines business two days earlier because of suspicions that the firms might be involved in anti-competitive practices.Competition officials at the European Commission did not specify the names of the companies visited, but said that they were involved in the manufacturing, supply and distribution of piston engines, mainly used for industrial applications – such as generator sets, or for industrial transportation.Cummins, another big player in this sector, said it was not amongst the companies targeted by officials.Officials in Brussels stressed, as is normal, that the fact of the raids did not mean that the companies were guilty of EU competition law violations or prejudge the outcome of its investigation. There is no set time limit for such probes.
30;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-05-23T20:59:00Z;US stocks fall on global growth worries;;Campbell Soup lost ground after reporting disappointing sales while the largest US indices tumbled below their 50-day moving averages as slack global growth figures created fresh doubts over earnings estimates for the next quarter.The world’s largest soup maker reported a better than expected quarterly profit and said it expected full-year results at the high end of its forecast.But US soup sales were down 7 per cent and margins declined, prompting its shares to fall 0.8 per cent to $34.95. In the previous quarter, US soup sales had fallen by 4 per cent.The S&P 500 was down 1.2 per cent to 1,317.37, led lower by those sectors most exposed to the global economy as weak economic data out of China and Europe prompted fears of a slowdown.“The economic data from China and Europe are causing people to question their earnings estimates for the next two quarters,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global. Although losses on Wall Street were broad-based, the industrial, energy and technology sectors were the worst-performing.Around 30 per cent of all sales in S&P 500 companies come from overseas but the technology, material and energy sectors have the greatest exposure to activity outside the US.In the industrial space, Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, fell 2.3 per cent to $101.89 while Cummins, the designer and manufacturer of power generation equipment, fell 2.1 per cent to $104.16.The S&P industrial index lost 1.4 per cent.The S&P energy index fell 1.5 per cent as oil prices slumped. Schlumberger, the oil services group, lost 1.7 per cent to $82.09.Losses in the technology sector were led by Red Hat, the software company, which slid 3.7 per cent to $44.03 while JDS Uniphase fell 3.6 per cent to $19.59.The technology sector garners 53 per cent of its sales from overseas, according to figures compiled by Citigroup.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 2 per cent to $47.42, leading the S&P materials index lower by 1 per cent.Telecommunications and utility stocks have the least international exposure and so suffered the slimmest losses in the session.The S&P telecoms sector was down only 0.7 per cent while the S&P utilities sector lost 1.2 per cent.Financial stocks saw losses, in spite of also having relatively low international exposure as worries over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe continued to mount.Citigroup was down 2.1 per cent to $40.16 while Suntrust Bankfell 2.5 per cent to $27.20.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.1 per cent lower at 12,380.88 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,758.90.The Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices all fell below their 50-day moving averages in the session, a signal of further selling to come.The benchmark S&P index has been hit by weekly falls for the last three weeks as some traders have worried that interest rate rises in emerging markets are finally starting to slow global growth, while others look nervously towards the imminent end of quantitative easing.Krispy Kreme was up 25.8 per cent to $8.05 after the doughnut chain reported that its net profit in the first quarter had more than doubled – it was the highest quarterly profit in more than seven years for the group.LinkedIn, the business- focused social networking site, failed to maintain the lofty price that it achieved on its first day of trading last week and fell 5.2 per cent to $88.30.The company priced on Wednesday night at $45 a share, already above the projected range, but the stock soared 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on Thursday.The stock is now down 6.3 per cent since then. On Tuesday, restrictions on short selling the stock will be lifted, which could precipitate a further drop.Shares in Apple were down 0.2 per cent to $334.40 following 1.6 per cent losses in the previous session as traders continued to watch the impact of an explosion at one of its main supplier’s factories late on Friday.Foxconn, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision, operated a plant that was set to produce most of Apple’s iPad 2, its second-generation tablet computer.The Vix volatility index was up 2.6 per cent to 17.88.
31;CMI;Cummins Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;It’s too late to buy into booming manufacturers;The valuation of the two stocks is at historic highs;On both sides of the Atlantic, stocks have been buoyed lately by strong results from old-line manufacturers. A good thing too, some will say. Time to wean the economy off banks and suchlike flim-flam enterprises.How far that notion makes sense is for another day. Certainly, there is an irrational instinct in many people’s minds that says everything depends on making things you can stub your toe on.But is that sentiment affecting investors? After a decade of disappointments – first technology stocks, then banks – it would be natural if they turned for reassurance to old-style makers of big solid objects.To test the thesis, let us take a couple of examples: Caterpillar – which produced strong first-quarter figures last Friday – and Cummins.Those two venerable US corporations have much in common, not least in terms of the remarkable performance of their stock in recent years.Both are about a century old, and both have largely stuck to their original business – earthmoving equipment and truck engines respectively. Relative to the S&P 500, neither stock has been this high in the 38 years I have data for.It is worth comparing a more new-fangled manufacturer, the IT hardware producer Cisco Systems. In mid 2000 – the all-time peak of overvaluation in US stocks – Cisco’s stock was at $75, Caterpillar’s at $18 and Cummins’ at $7.Cisco is now at $17, Caterpillar at $115 and Cummins at $119. Yet Cisco has beaten the other two in sales growth over the period, and Caterpillar in earnings (though not Cummins, which was only breaking even back in 2000).Of course, Cisco was grossly overvalued in the dotcom boom, and traditional companies were despised accordingly. But there is more to it than that. Cummins, for instance, has outperformed the market by a factor of four in the past five years alone.As in the dotcom episode, there seems to be a broader story at work. This time it is about growth is developing nations, which have a monstrous appetite for primary goods and equipment. As with copper and steel, so with trucks and bulldozers.That should, of course, show up in the figures. But the snag is that both companies – Caterpillar especially – are highly cyclical.In 2009 Caterpillar’s worldwide sales of machinery – the bulk of its business – tumbled 43 per cent, then recovered 88 per cent last year. As a result, operating profit for the division went from $1.8bn to a loss of $1bn, then back to a profit of $2bn.Peering through the mayhem, it seems clear that the story has something in it. Caterpillar’s sales growth over the past decade has averaged 3 per cent within the US and 11 per cent in the rest of the world. For Cummins the figures are 2 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.As a result, the proportion of Caterpillar’s sales outside the US has risen over the period from 50 per cent to 68 per cent, and Cummins’ from 43 per cent to 64 per cent.If the story is about the old world giving way to the new, both companies are making the most of it.But caution is called for. Both companies are developing-world veterans. Caterpillar has been in Brazil since 1960, and Cummins in India since 1962. They have been exposed to global growth from various sources all along. And global growth, remember, has been trending sideways for decades, the recent big dip excepted.And whereas the valuation of the two stocks is nowhere near dotcom excesses, it is still at historic highs.Over long periods the price/earnings ratio tends to be slippery, if only because of accounting differences. But I calculate that the last time the price of the two stocks was anything like this high relative to the market – in the late 1970s – Cummins was at a P/E discount of some 40 per cent, and Caterpillar at a 10 per cent premium. Today Cummins is on a near-30 per cent premium and Caterpillar double that.This is scarcely bubble territory – unlike, perhaps, mining and commodities. But it depends on the same narrative – one which, in relation to China especially, is scarcely novel.And here is the slight concern. Those who recall the dotcom boom will know it was not based on a false premise, exactly. IT was indeed the wave of the future.Rather, the reaction to that premise was grossly overdone – the more so with the passage of time.In other words, any story gets overbought eventually.It is good to see Caterpillar and Cummins in the ranks of old-established US corporations that just keep on flourishing. But as for buying their stock, it might be a little late this time round.
32;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-04-26T20:43:28Z;Industrials lift Wall Street;;The S&P 500 index jumped to a multi-year high after promising consumer confidence data and a range of strong earnings reports from leading industry names, such as Ford Motor, 3M and UPS.Shares in Ford rose 0.8 per cent to $15.66 after the carmaker reported first-quarter net earnings of $2.55bn, its highest profit for the period in 13 years and a 22 per cent advance on a year earlier. Its 61 cents of earnings per share in the quarter, up from 50 cents a year earlier, was also well above the 46 cents estimated by analysts.3M gained after the industrial group reported a 16 per cent jump in first-quarter profit.The stock was up1.9 per cent to $95.94. George Buckley, 3M’s chief executive, said that demand for materials used in the screens for tablet computers was “going up like a rocket ship. And we are the supplier to those folks”. But he added that disruptions from the Japanese earthquake would hit earnings by 10-13 cents per share this year.United Parcel Service also recorded gains after one of the world’s largest package delivery companies managed to shrug off higher fuel prices and bad weather to report a 66 per cent jump in net income for the first quarter. UPS reported net income of $885m, or 88 cents in diluted earnings per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents a share and sending shares in the company up 0.9 per cent to $74.30. The logistics group, which is often regarded as a bellwether of the global economy, also reported higher margins and raised its full-year earnings forecast.Cummins jumped 7.6 per cent to $116.39 after the maker of truck engines reported that its first-quarter profit had more than doubled. The well-received results left the S&P industrial sector up 1.8 per cent, the best performing sector on the S&P.Caterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, was up 2.8 per cent to $111.94 while General Electric gained 1.1 per cent to $20.10, as both stocks benefited from the generally higher sentiment in the industrial space.These gains helped the benchmark S&P 500 index close 0.9 per cent higher at 1,347.24, its highest level since June 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also up 0.9 per cent to 12,595.45 while the Nasdaq gained 0.8 per cent to 2,847.54, a 3½-year high.Also lifting sentiment in the wider markets was news that the US consumer had become slightly more optimistic in April, according to data from the Conference Board.The research group said that its index of consumer confidence increased to 65.4 in April, up from a revised 63.8 in March as more Americans said they expected their incomes to rise in the near future.On the negative side, the Richmond Federal Reserve reported weaker manufacturing activity and US home prices fell by 3.3 per cent in February from a year earlier, according to the S&P Case-Shiller home price indices. The fall in house prices was not unexpected.Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, said that now “rest period” in the markets was likely over the coming months, with the S&P ending the quarter only very slightly higher from here.Results from Coca-Cola were the only big disappointment of the session, as the company’s first-quarter earnings per share came in a penny short of Wall Street estimates. In spite of this, net income at the world’s largest soft drinks company by revenues rose 18 per cent from the same period last year to $1.9bn, or 82 cents a share.It also reported a rise in sales around the world in spite of rising commodity prices and political turmoil. Still, the earnings miss left the stock down 1.2 per cent at $66.93.Shares in Netflix fell 9 per cent to $228.91 after a disappointing earnings outlook. Investors focused on this, in spite of the company reporting net income at the top end of expectations. The DVD subscription and film streaming service said it added more than 3m subscribers in the quarter.Delta Air Lines jumped 11 per cent to $9.99 after the airline’s first-quarter earnings and revenue beat expectation. The world’s largest airline by market value still reported a loss, however, due to higher fuel costs.Emulex, the chipmaker, fell 6.2 per cent to $9.71 after forecasting disappointing fourth-quarter adjusted earnings.
33;CMI;Cummins Inc;2011-04-22T15:45:37Z;Hampson loses case over sold subsidiary;;Hampson Industries has lost an action brought by a group of private investors who had claimed “fraudulent misrepresentation” following the purchase a subsidiary sold to them for £2.5m in cash last June.The aerospace components and tooling supplier has been ordered to return the money and faces further costs under the terms of a high court judgment which unusually requires the rescission, or unwinding, of the deal.A consortium of private investors led by Midlands industrialist David Grove claimed Hampson misled them over the revenues of a subsidiary, Hampson Precision Automotive, which makes turbocharger components.According to the claim, Hampson deliberately withheld information about a dispute with ICSI, a major customer accounting for half of the subsidiary’s revenues, that could have affected the reliability of sales.Following the ruling, Mr Gove said: “I have not yet received a written copy of the transcript of the judgment and therefore have not been able to discuss the content and consequences with my fellow director and shareholder. However it is clear that the outcome fully vindicates our decision to take legal action against Hampson Industries.”Chris Geoghegan, Hampson’s chairman, appeared to play down the potential for any further embarrassment to the company when details of the written judgment on allegations of misrepresentation by Hampson executives emerges.Mr Geoghegan said he was “very surprised at the outcome of this litigation, given the professional advice consistently received by the board on this matter”.He added: “We note that no finding of wrongdoing was made against any serving officer or director of Hampson. While we respect the court’s findings, we will carry out a detailed review of the judgment and will consider whether to appeal.”Erlson, the purchasing consortium, had also claimed the cost of paying off HPA’s debts of £615,000, and £850,000 to £1m for costs including due diligence.Hampson conceded that, should it opt not to appeal, it would face paying a contribution towards Erlson’s legal costs and associates claim, “the quantum of which has yet to be assessed”.Following the judgment, Hampson also confirmed that there had been no further progress in its own legal claims against the previous owner of two US businesses bought for a combined $253m three years ago.The Odyssey and GTS businesses make tools used in the production of carbon composite parts for the Boeing 787 and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.Hampson is suing Randal Bellestri, a US industrialist who sold the two businesses to it in 2008.In a writ issued last year, the US subsidiary of Hampson accused Mr Bellestri and his wife Kimberly of “engaging in improper, self-dealing transactions” that allegedly included the cost of cleaning a fish tank in their mansion.Mr and Mrs Bellestri’s attorney indicated that the couple were set to “vigorously defend the lawsuit as the allegations are unfounded”.In note following the court judgment, broker Investec described it as “a setback” but said that the size of the subsidiary which was to have been sold under the aborted deal was “relatively small in the group context.”Shares in Hampson, which last year returned to profit and is expected to generate revenues close to £200m in the year to March 31, closed down ½p at 26½p on Thursday.
34;CMI;Cummins Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

This sent shares in the company up 5.5 per cent to $19.22.The industry bellwether posted income of $2.89bn, or 36 cents a share, up from $767m, or 10 cents a share a year earlier. Optimism over the stock was muted slightly, however, as the company gave a 2011 profit forecast that was below analysts’ expectations.Nevertheless, the news helped lift the rest of the pharmaceutical sector. Mylan, one of the world’s largest generic drugs companies, was up 1.6 per cent to $23.54 while Merck gained 2.5 per cent to $34.But the best performing sector on Wall Street was the materials sector, which was lifted by data showing booming manufacturing activity in the US and around the world.The S&P materials index was up 2.8 per cent to 246.02 as the ISM manufacturing composite index jumped to 60.8 in January, up 2.3 from December and ahead of the median forecast of 58. This was its highest level since May 2004.“Today’s report is another very strong signal regarding near-term manufacturing activity. To sustain this strength, much will depend on the consumer,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Among the stocks to gain were Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coal miner, which was up 4.9 per cent to $89.64 and Alcoa, an aluminium producer, which added 4.5 per cent to $17.32.This helped the S&P 500 close 1.7 per cent higher to 1,307,59 busting through the technically significant 1,300 mark that the markets struggled with last week.The S&P index lost 1.8 per cent late last week on disappointing GDP figures and concerns that the Suez Canal might be shut down due to the protests in Egypt. But the markets have now completely bounced back from those losses after two consecutive sessions of strong gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent to 12,040.16, the first time the index closed above 12,000 since June 2008. Last month, the index saw its best January performance since 1997. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.9 per cent to 2,751.19 in the session.Central to investor confidence in the session was a string of healthy earnings reports. Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, reported that second-quarter earnings had jumped 29 per cent in the second quarter due to high grain prices and strong global demand. This sent shares in the company up 6.2 per cent to $34.70.ADM reported a net profit of $732m, or $1.14 per share, compared with a profit of $567m, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier and way ahead of analysts’ estimates of 78 cents per share.United Parcel Service also saw strong results, reporting a 48 per cent jump in profits due to strong demand over the holiday period. The logistics group also forecast that 2011 will see record earnings, eclipsing the 2007 peak in earnings. The news lifted the shares 4.2 per cent to $74.59.Fedex, another global delivery company, added 2.6 per cent to $92.69.Also helping to liven the S&P index were energy stocks, which saw strong gains as the Brent crude oil price hit $100 a barrel in the previous session for the first time since October 2008.ExxonMobil, the giant of the energy sector, was up another 4 per cent to $83.91 in the session. The company posted earnings on Monday close to the 2008 record, which sent the shares up 2.1 per cent. The stock is up 36 per cent since the start of September.Murphy Oil was up 3.1 per cent to $68.37 while the S&P energy index added 1.9 per cent to 554.13.Lexmark International, which makes laser and inkjet printers, saw some of the strongest gains on the S&P index, rising 13.2 per cent to $39.45 after predicting strong first-quarter
profits.Baidu saw strong gains after the Chinese internet-search group said revenue had doubled in the fourth quarter and net earnings had increased by 171 per cent, beating analyst and company expectations. The stock was up 9.3 per cent to $118.73. Rival Google rose 1.8 per cent to $611.04"

We might see technology pick up, as there are elements of a real cyclical recovery here.”But airline stocks were largely unaffected after the snow kept many aircraft grounded, with the S&P 500 airlines index rising 0.4 per cent.AMR Corp, parent of American Airlines, added 1.4 per cent to $7.89, Delta Air Linesgained 1.8 per cent to $12.45 but US Airways nudged down 0.4 per cent to $9.87.Financials, which have risen 10.8 per cent since the start of December on the back of hopes for an improved economy in 2011 and a steepening of the US Treasuries yield curve, edged up further.The S&P 500 financials sector added 1 per cent on Monday with AIG soaring 9.3 per cent to $59.39, the most in the S&P 500.The bailed-out insurer signed $4.3bn worth of credit agreements, seeking to replace government finance with private funds.The shares have gained 42.7 per cent in the past month as the group put together plans for paying back the US government.Goldman Sachs rose 1.3 per cent to $169.83 after the bank adopted a provision in its executive pay scheme that will reward senior staff on their ability to meet long-term performance goals without encouraging “imprudent risk-taking”.Electric carmaker Tesla Motors fell 15.1 per cent to $25.55 after the expiration of a 180-day lock-up period following its initial public offering, but it remained higher than the IPO price of $17 per share.Shares in casual dining chains slipped after a newspaper story suggested that they could fall 20 per cent or more if the expectations for 2011 earnings are not met.Chipotle Mexican Grilllost 2.5 per cent to $222.56 and Panera Bread, a bakery chain, was down 1.2 per cent at $102.86.

surging 4.6 per cent to $18.07 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gaining 4.1 per cent to $105.49.The S&P 500 industrials index jumped 2.6 per cent with Caterpillar, the best performing Dow stock in November, gaining 3.4 per cent to $87.45, Cummins adding 3.5 per cent to $100.52 and Honeywell advancing 2.4 per cent to $50.88.Investors were cheered by the Chinese Purchasing Managers’ Index, which climbed to a seven-month high, and the ISM index of US manufacturing activity, which slipped only slightly in November after a very strong October.In a big day for US economic data, ADP’s national employment report released before the opening bell showed that the number of private sector jobs had risen more than expectedin November.“Although we do not put great weight on ADP employment in our payroll forecast, it is worth noting that this is the strongest reading on ADP private payroll growth since Nov-ember 2007 (the month before the onset of the recession),” said John Ryding, of RDQ Economics.A separate report showed US non-farm productivity in the third quarter had grown faster than previously estimated. The upward revision of the figure, a leading indicator for hiring, matched economists’ expectations.Recruitment companies, which have risen significantly in the past couple of months, gained after the report. Monster Worldwide, which rose 25 per cent in November, added 1.7 per cent to $22.97 while Manpower was up 2.4 per cent to $57.27.Fears about the stability of the eurozone, which have dominated the market in the past two weeks, subsided after Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said the ECB could step up its purchases of eurozone bonds.A report showed US shoppers had spent 16 per cent more online on Monday, the busy internet shopping day now dubbed Cyber Monday, than on the same day last year. The ComScore release said sales from websites had reached $1.03bn.The S&P 500 retail index added 1.8 per cent. But Amazon gained just 0.7 per cent to $176.55 and Ebay nudged up 0.4 per cent to $29.26.Google fell on Tuesday after the European Union said it had opened a full investigation into allegations from smaller competitors that the company
had abused its dominant market position. But the stock rebounded 1.6 per cent to $564.35 after it was reported the company planned to open an online store for electronic books in the US this year and internationally in 2011.American Express added 2.5 per cent to $44.30 after the payment processor was rated “overweight” by Richard Shane, an analyst at JPMorgan.Mr Shane started coverage of the stock with a 12-month price target of
$50 a share, saying its spend-driven model should outperform companies

It beat expectations in its third quarter as same-store sales rose 7 per cent. It also raised its earnings forecast for the full year to a range above analysts’ expectations.Durable goods orders unexpectedly fell in October, down 3.3 per cent, in the biggest drop since January 2009. The jump in September was revised higher to an increase of 5 per cent.But S&P 500 industrials still managed to rise the most in the wider indices, up 2.1 per cent, with Caterpillar up 2.5 per cent to $84.69, Textron up 4.2 per cent to $22.44 and Cummins up 3.9 per cent to $98.65.Deere fell 0.1 per cent to $76.23, even though the maker of farm equipment issued a profit forecast for 2011 that fell short of analyst estimates.

It is the largest contingent of US chief executives to accompany a president on a state visit.Deals that are expected to be signed before, during or just after Mr Obama’s trip, include a $5.8bn sale by Boeing of C17 aircraft to the Indian government .In addition, either General Electric or Caterpillar is expected to win a $5bn order to supply locomotives to Indian Railways. Cummins and John Deere also have deals lined up.According to Ron Somers, of the US India Business Council, the total number of deals could help create or sustain 100,000 US jobs based on the US government’s formula of 11,000 jobs for every $1bn worth of deals.US businesses are eager to put commercial meat on a relationship unlocked by the US-India civil nuclear deal in 2008, under the presidency of George W. Bush. “We need to see some things that are going to demonstrate that this relationship has pay-offs,” said a US embassy official in New Delhi.Liberalisation of India’s restricted retail environment has been highlighted ahead of the visit. A closer defence relationship has also been identified. But obstacles remain. The US has struggled to agree an investment treaty with India and US companies are wary of intellectual property abuses.
40;CMI;Cummins Inc;2010-10-26T20:44:46Z;US steelmakers dragged by weak forecasts;;Losses at AK Steel and US Steel and a strengthening dollar weighed on the materials sector.Materials stocks edged down 0.2 per cent, after falling sharply in early trade, as soaring raw materials costs and a sluggish economic recovery hit steel industry earnings.Steel companies in September made a round of pre-announcements predicting shortfalls in third-quarter profits, but investors still recoiled after disappointing earnings.AK Steel slumped 4 per cent to $12.84 after it reported a third-quarter net loss. US Steel also posted a net loss and warned that the fourth quarter would be similar because of the uncertain economy in North America and Europe. Its shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $40.85.But Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott said it was not just the steel company’s outlooks, some of which had been priced in, but also the strengthening dollar that was hitting materials stocks.DuPont, the chemical maker, lost 1 per cent to $47.22 even though it beat analyst expectations on profits and sales and raised its full-year forecast.The S&P 500 closed flat at 1,185.64, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1 per cent to close at 11,169.46 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent higher at 2,497.29.Stocks pared their losses after data showed consumer confidence rebounded from a seven-month low in October and IBM announced extra money for share repurchases.Technology stocks had fallen in early trading, dragged down by a weak forecast from Texas Instruments, but the sector reversed and was up 0.1 per cent after the IBM board authorised an additional $10bn for share buy-backs.Shares in IBM edged up 0.6 per cent to $140.67 and, as one of the stocks with the largest market capitalisations, that helped the broader indices erase their losses.Chipmaker Texas Instruments slid 0.4 per cent to $28.88 after it warned that its fourth-quarter revenues would be hurt by slowing demand for chips for computers and televisions.In the third quarter, Texas Instruments beat expectations on revenue and earnings.But Christopher Danely, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, said investors should pay attention to the reduction in lead times for chips which he said could indicate a drop in future order rates. He compared the current decline in lead times with a fall in 2003-04, which came before a dip in order rates.In industrials, Cummins sank 5.8 per cent to $89.00 after it reported a large rise in quarterly profit, beating expectations, but missing analysts’ sales forecasts.The conglomerate also raised its guidance for the full year on the back of strong international sales of its engines and power-generation products.Ford Motor also beat expectations with its record-breaking quarterly earnings as it persuaded US consumers to buy European-style smaller cars and benefited from a rebound in sales of pick-up trucks.The carmaker said it expected to slash debt in its automotive business by the end of the year. Its shares advanced 1.5 per cent to $14.36.In pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Amgen reported their earnings. Bristol-Myers Squibb announced better-than-expected earnings before the opening bell.Lower taxes and cost cuts boosted profits but revenues disappointed investors because of weak sales of Abilify, its schizophrenia treatment, which has been the company’s growth driver in recent years, as well as the costs of US healthcare reform. The shares lost 1.1 per cent to $26.86.AmGen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, slid after its sales came in weaker than expected. The shares were down 1.2 per cent to $57.26 after sales of Prolia, its new osteoporosis drug, were only a third of what analysts had projected.Outside of earnings news, the S&P 500 homebuilders index fell 1.1 per cent after house prices fell in August compared to the month before, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index of prices in 20 cities.
41;CMI;Cummins Inc;2010-10-24T17:20:07Z;Overseas demand lifts US manufacturers;;The US economy may be faltering, but many big names in American manufacturing are going from strength to strength.In the past week, a succession of industrial companies, including Boeing, Honeywell, Caterpillar and Eaton, reported good third-quarter results and gave upbeat views on their prospects. Over the next two weeks, others, including Emerson Electric, 3M and Cummins are expected to show similar evidence of robust health.Yet in recent weeks, concerns over the strength of the recovery have been gathering force. Official data showed US industrial production fell in September, for the first time in more than a year. The discrepancy raises the question of whether US companies have been able to see sources of strength that macroeconomic data have missed, or have failed to appreciate the slowdown about to hit them.Honeywell, which makes industrial equipment and aircraft components, predicted on Friday that profits in its operating businesses would rise by 10 per cent or more next year.However, David Anderson, the chief financial officer, sounded a note of caution. “The markets we are in are generally in pretty good shape. But many of the macroeconomic indicators, particularly outside the industrial economy, are mixed to soft,” he said. “You have got to say, ‘How long will it continue?’ ”One reason for the disconnect is that markets outside the US are much stronger. The outperformance of the industrial sector this year compared with the broad S&P 500 index has reflected the health of overseas markets rather than that of the US economy.A common theme in all of last week’s good results was the strength of demand in China, other emerging Asian economies, the Middle East and Latin America.Most large industrial companies say they want to produce as much as possible in the markets they serve, but exports from the US are also rising, in a move towards the rebalancing of the world economy that is sought by many policymakers.About 25 per cent of US manufacturing output is exported, and David Huether, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, calculates that the dollar is about 10 per cent undervalued relative to its long-term average, giving US exporters an advantage. But the strength of exports may not be enough to sustain flagging growth.Eric Landry, who covers the industrial sector for Morningstar, the investment research company, warned: “Some of the forward-looking indicators can sometimes do better at predicting the outlook for companies than comments made by the companies themselves.”
42;CMI;Cummins Inc;2010-10-05T20:47:21Z;US stocks rally on Bank of Japan’s QE policy;;US equities jumped to their highest since mid-May after the Bank of Japan unveiled plans to ease monetary policy and better-than-expected data on the US services sector sparked hopes of a speedier global economic recovery.The S&P 500 closed up 2.1 per cent to 1,160.73, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.8 per cent to close at 10,944.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.4 per cent higher at 2,399.83.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rallied more than 1 per cent with six soaring more than 2 per cent, led by the materials and industrials indices.The Bank of Japan said that it was considering creating a Y5,000bn ($59.7bn) fund to buy assets to increase liquidity in the financial system, and lowered its interest rate.Some investors hoped this might open the door for the Federal Reserve to extend its own programme of quantitative easing.Shares rose further after a report showed the US services sector was re-bounding faster than ex-pected.But the positive data made Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, question whether the Fed would be prepared to intervene.“Both the headline and the details of the non-manufacturing Institute of Supply Management index came in better than expected and as a result the pressure on the Fed to execute QE2 [a second round of quantitative easing] has been reduced,” he said.“QE2 is very data dependant because the way to convince the dissenters is for the data to come in weaker than expected.”The index rose to 53.2 in September, compared with the average economist forecast of 52.Materials and industrials sectors were lifted by hopes for a faster economic recovery.The S&P 500 materials index led the risers, advancing 2.8 per cent with Dow Chemical adding 3.6 per cent to $28.47, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gaining 4.5 per cent to $91.18 and Newmont Mining rising 1.5 per cent to $63.67.The industrials sector was up 2.7 per cent with Caterpillar climbing 2.8 per cent to $79.40 and Cummins rising 2.8 per cent to $92.24.In energy stocks, Chevron rose 2.6 per cent to $83.39 after the oil company said it plans to resume its share buy-back programme this quarter, repurchasing up to $1bn of stock.Financials also rose, up 2.4 per cent, after analysts at JPMorgan Chase said banks were likely to beat the third quarter profit estimates, even though many other analysts have recently raised concerns about their earnings.Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent to $13.56, Citigroup gained 2.5 per cent to $4.13 and JPMorgan Chase added 1.8 per cent to $39.64.Information technology stocks added 1.9 per cent with PC maker Dell rising 3.9 per cent to $13.40 after Steve Schuckenbrock, the head of its large enterprise business, said it was seeing good demand for new personal computers in offices.Texas Instruments soared 4.1 per cent to $28.33, Google jumped 3 per cent to $538.23 and Apple rose 3.7 per cent to $288.94.Although the earnings season officially kicks off with Alcoa’s results on Thursday, some companies were already updating the market on their performance in the last quarter.Fertiliser maker Mosaic missed expectations with its first-quarter earnings in spite of tripling profits as sales of its products surged 50 per cent. Earnings were 67 cents per share, compared with the average estimate of 71 cents. But the shares still rose 3.4 per cent to $60.80.Talbots, the women’s clothing chain, sunk 14.6 per cent to $10.71 after it forecast third-quarter sales would fall. It had previously predicted a rise in sales in the third quarter, but now sees a decline, because the number of customers passing through the doors has been “inconsistent”.The company predicts earnings per share for the quarter of between 22 and 28 cents compared with the average estimate of 27 cents. But for the full year, the retailer still sees a 1 per cent rise in sales and earnings per share of between 84 and 92 cents.MaxLinear also lowered its third-quarter sales forecast to no more than $18.6m, when the average estimate was $20.3m.Shares plummeted 11.7 per cent to $10.03.
43;CMI;Cummins Inc;2010-09-24T21:00:32Z;US stocks rally on durable goods figures;;"US stocks rallied after data showed that spending on durable goods rebounded in August and that the figure for July was better than previously reported.The S&P 500 closed up 2.1 per cent to 1,148.67, up 2 per cent over the week, its fourth successive weekly gain.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.9 per cent to close at 10,860.26, rising 2.4 per cent over the five days and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.3 per cent higher to close at 2,381.22, up 2.8 per cent on the week.Data released on Friday showed orders for durable goods, excluding the volatile transportation sector, climbed 2 per cent in August. Economists had forecast an increase of 1 per cent for the leading indicator of manufacturing activity. Including transportation, orders fell 1.3 per cent as Boeing saw civilian aircraft orders decline sharply.“It’s the realisation that the double dip is receding in probability and I would say the durable goods data today is in some sense the frosting on the cake,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist with Principal Global Investors. Mr Baur said it was natural to see a weakening in economic growth after a sharp rise.“Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard was bare so manufacturers had to ramp up production very fast from a low level just to put stuff on the shelves. Then this began to decelerate and that’s where everyone starts to worry.”All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose – nine rising more than 1 per cent and six more than 2 per cent.Industrials led the risers, up 2.8 per cent, on hopes for a speedier economic recovery. Caterpillargained 4.6 per cent to $79.73 and Cummins added 2.9 per cent to $90.86.Housebuilders, which were yo-yoing all week in response to mixed data on the housing market, soared 3.1 per cent after new-home sales remained steady, at a low 288,000, in August. The financials sector, which has suffered after some analysts lowered their projections for quarterly bank profits, advanced 2.8 per cent, wiping out the week’s losses.Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $25.15, Goldman Sachs rose 1.6 per cent to $147.28 and Citigroup jumped 2.7 per cent to $3.90.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index added 2.6 per cent, lifted by news from Nike. The world’s largest manufacturer of athletics shoes beat expectations with its first-quarter profit and offered a positive outlook. Earnings per share were $1.14 compared with predictions of $1 per share after strong demand in China and the US.Sales soared 8 per cent and future orders jumped
13 per cent. Shares in Nike added 2.5 per cent to reach an all-time high of $79.57.But also in athletic apparel, retailer Finish Linefell 9.2 per cent to $14.25 after it missed estimates because it failed to restock popular items quickly enough.The technology sector, which has been the biggest riser so far in September, up 12.6 per cent, advanced 2 per cent. Amazon hit an all-time high, rising 5.2 per cent to $160.73.Chipmakers were in focus after Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, said the software maker might buy a chip manufacturer.Oracle fell 0.6 per cent to $26.96 but US-listed shares of ARM Holdings, which designs chips that power iPhones, surged 7.6 per cent to $19.79 on speculation that it could be a target.Advanced Micro Devices, a chipmaker, rose 6.9 per cent to $6.84 in spite of saying third-quarter sales would be weaker than predicted because of lower demand for notebook computers in Europe and North America.Rival Intel, which reduced its forecast at the end of August, gained
2.3 per cent to $19.42.Gold companies, which have risen this week with the price of gold, continued to climb, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold up 2.8 per cent to $86.61."
44;CMI;Cummins Inc;2010-08-11T02:16:34Z;Investor group sues Hampson over sale;;A consortium of private investors led by Midlands industrialist David Grove is suing engineering group Hampson Industries for almost £4m ($6.3m), alleging “fraudulent misrepresentation”.They claim that Hampson misled them concerning the revenues of a subsidiary, Hampson Precision Automotive, which they bought for £2.5m cash in June.In a statement last night Hampson said: “The proceedings brought in relationship to the disposal of Hampson’s automotive business are entirely misconceived and are being extremely strongly disputed. Having received appropriate legal advice, the board is confident the proceedings will be rebutted successfully.”Hampson, which is capitalised at about £160m, announced the sale of HPA on June 23. The disposal of the turbocharger components company was part of the group’s strategy of focusing on the aerospace market.According to particulars of a claim filed with the High Court, Paul Clarkson and Danny Haigh, two senior HPA executives, “expressed concerns” to Hampson finance director Howard Kimberley in March that they were misleading Les Litwinowicz, one of the investors, during sale negotiations.Mr Clarkson and Mr Haigh were worried that an information memorandum and management presentations about HPA portrayed a relationship with ICSI, a customer generating over 50 per cent of sales, as “ongoing”, when in reality it was shaky.Allegedly Mr Kimberley told the men not to worry because this was “the mergers and acquisitions game” and that GIL Investments, a company representing the investors, had “a track record of stitching people up”. According to the claim, Hampson deliberately withheld information about a dispute with ICSI that could have affected the reliability of sales forecasts for HPA.GG132, the bidding vehicle led by Mr Grove, alleges that in May the engineering group Cummins, HPA’s second-largest customer, told Kim Ward, Hampson’s chief executive, that it would terminate the relationship by September. GG132 claims that “the defendant …deliberately concealed from the Claimant the fact that Cummins had announced its intention to exit HPA.”According to GG132, just hours after the sale of HPA was completed on June 23, Mr Ward sent Mr Haigh, who had stayed with the business, a copy of a letter from Cummins dated June 22. Here, Cummins gave official notice it would cease buying equipment from HPA. GG132 alleges that the letter refers to “previous conversations” between Hampson and Cummins concerning a cessation of orders after August 31.The investor group led by Mr Grove, former chairman of listed engineer Hill & Smith, wants the High Court to declare that it is entitled to rescind its purchase of HPA. Hampson would then pay back the £2.5m cash purchase price. GG132 is additionally claiming the cost of paying off HPA’s debts of £615,000 and £850,000 to £1m for costs including due diligence.
45;CMI;Cummins Inc;2010-07-27T20:48:08Z;Consumer confidence data weigh on Wall St;;"US equities nudged down on Tuesday after worse than expected consumer confidence figures erased early gains made after positive earnings reports.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,113.84, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to close at 10,537.69 and the Nasdaq closed 0.4 per cent lower at 2,288.25.Investor sentiment was dampened by the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index for July, which said confidence had hit a five-month low. The index fell from 54.3, a revised figure for June, to 50.4, below forecasts of 51.“Generally nobody wants to see a jobless recovery and the consumer confidence number indicates that there’s still uncertainty out there even though earnings numbers have been generally very very good,” said Mike Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners.“The everyday consumer doesn’t necessarily see all that, they see that their neighbour is unemployed.”The S&P 500 retail sector led the fallers, down by 1.9 per cent and the consumer discretionary sector fell 1.2 per cent. Best Buy was down 3.9 per cent to $35.45; Urban Outfitters lost 4.8 per cent to $32.97 and Gap fell 3.9 per cent to $18.29.Before the open, data on the housing market showed a rise in property values of 4.6 per cent in May, compared with a predicted rise of 3.9 per cent. But the S&P 500 homebuilders index fell 1.6 per cent.The S&P 500 Financials index edged up 0.1 per cent after positive earnings from European banks UBS and Deutsche Bank and news that new tighter Basel III capital rules would be delayed. US-listed stocks of UBS rose 8.9 per cent to $16.51 and Deutsche Bank’s US shares were up 2.8 per cent to $68.06. Bank of America rose 0.3 per cent to $14.19 and Citigroup was up 0.2 per cent to $4.16.Positive earnings news from the industrials and materials sectors raised hopes of industrial recovery in early trading.DuPont reported its second-quarter profit nearly tripled because of a surge in sales and volume across all five divisions. The company said net income rose to $1.17bn, or $1.26 per share, from $417m, or 41 cents per share, for the same period a year earlier. The chemicals group raised its 2010 earnings forecast to a range of $2.90 to $3.05 per share, excluding exceptional items, from a previous forecast $2.50 to $2.70. Shares rose 3.6 per cent to $40.38.Industrials reporting included Fluor Corp, the engineering and construction group, which said it might reach a record backlog of projects this year because of demand from the energy industry, helped by new awards of $9.3bn. It reported better than expected second-quarter net income, which fell to 87 cents per share compared with analysts’ estimates of 93 cents per share. Shares rose 2.6 per cent to $49.10.Cummins, which makes engines and generator equipment, added to the picture of a rise in industrial activity as it reported better than expected quarterly results and raised its full-year forecast. Sales outside the US, which make up two-thirds of its revenue, rose 51 per cent in the quarter. Shares rose 2 per cent to $79.43. Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence group, fell a fraction to $74.87 after it posted a 12 per cent jump in profit and increased its full-year forecast.But the materials sector was pushed down by a more negative mood in steel. US Steel Corporation said it was seeing slower order rates in spite of doubling its sales to $4.68bn this quarter. It posted an unexpected second-quarter loss because of revaluing a $1.4bn loan made to a European loan unit. Shares fell 6.4 per cent to $45.76. The negative outlook pushed AK Steel Holding Corp down 4.7 per cent to $14.49 in spite of reporting better than expected earnings.Gold producers fell as the metal hit an 11-week low because of the rally in equities. Newmont Mining Corporation fell 4 per cent to $55.78. Goldcorp dropped
3.7 per cent to $38.82.US-listed shares in BP fell 1.7 per cent to $38.00 after it reported a $17bn loss for the second quarter, after making a pre-tax provision of $32.2bn for the cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It plans to sell assets valued at $30bn to meet the costs."
46;CMI;Cummins Inc;2010-05-26T21:05:44Z;Rebound falters in late trade to leave Dow in red;;"US stocks gave back the day’s gains late in the session on Wednesday to close lower, despite worries about the European fiscal situation easing slightly and a number of positive macroeconomic indicators to bolster the bulls.Durable goods orders last month comfortably beat expectations, led by a recovery in demand for aircraft.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent at 1,067.92, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to 9,974.45 and the Nasdaq Composite also slipped 0.7 per cent higher at 2,195.88.Pro-cyclical sectors, and industrial stocks in particular, led the day’s rally but could not hold on to all their gains.Caterpillar, the construction equipment maker, rallied 0.9 per cent to $59.73, Joy Global a mining equipment maker, rose 2.4 per cent to $49.87, and Cummins, a maker of diesel engines, was up 1.6 per cent at $65.98.Aircraft maker Boeingadded 0.8 per cent to $63.26 as the stock was upgraded to “equal weight” from “underweight” at Morgan Stanley.Ford Motor was one of the session’s best performers, rising 3.4 per cent to $11.39. This week the carmaker said it planned to open three new factories to build electric cars.The Vix index, a measure of expected market volatility, was down by
1.5 per cent to 34. On Tuesday it reached 42, just off its highs for the year.Among financials, Citigroup was up 2.1 per cent to $3.86, Morgan Stanley rallied 1.6 per cent to $26.53 but Bank of America reversed late in the session to close 0.1 per cent lower to $15.47.Sales of new homes rose by 14.8 per cent last month, according to government data released on Wednesday. The figures beat consensus expectations, even when the effect of a home-buying tax credit was taken into account. Lennar Corp rallied 0.5 per cent to $17.25. Rival housebuilders Pulte Group slid 0.5 per cent to $10.81 and DR Hortonwas down 0.7 per cent to $12.01.Teen fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters plunged 16.6 per cent to $12.82 as it forecast second-quarter earnings of up to 16 cent per share, missing the 21 cents per share average estimate.Apple fell 0.5 per cent to $244.11 but still managed to overtake Microsoftas the biggest technology company by market value. Microsoft fell 4.1 per cent to $25.01.Solarfun Power, a China-based manufacturer of photovoltaic cells, rallied 13.1 per cent to $7.10 after it reported significantly stronger-than-expected first-quarter results and raised its full-year shipment estimates.Film studio DreamWorks retreated 8 per cent to $29.05 after a weak opening of its fourth Shrek film.."
47;CMI;Cummins Inc;2008-12-11T21:49:00Z;Financials suffer on USB writedown warning;;Financial stocks led an afternoon retreat on Wall Street on Thursday after a warning from US Bancorp heightenend concerns that the forthcoming earnings season would bring heavy writedowns.Shares in US Bancorp have outperformed the financial sector by 92 per cent over the last year, as the bank appeared to have avoided the serious difficulties others have endured during the financial crisis.But they tumbled 10.2 per cent to $24.85 on Thursday after the bank said it could incur $1bn in credit costs and writedowns in the fourth quarter.A note from Richard Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalman, helped push Wells Fargo, a close peer, down 11.3 per cent to $25.90.“Near-term concerns about loan quality and margins are going to be most important and the outlook here is not good,” he said.The financial sector overall tumbled 8.5 per cent. JPMorgan Chase sank 10.7 per cent to $29.94 after Jamie Dimon, chief executive, told CNBC Television the bank has endured a “terrible” December.Real estate investment trusts sustained particularly heavy losses. The FTSE REITS index sank 15.5 per cent and came under pressure from a bearish Citigroup note on the banking sector.“We now forecast a severe credit cycle in commercial and commercial real estate,” the analysts said.XL Capital, which sank 33 per cent on Wednesday to the lowest level since the company went public, fell a further 11.8 per cent to $3.44. The insurer said it expected to report losses of at least $200m from its alternative investment portfolio and appointed Goldman Sachs to “explore value-enhancing opportunities”.Visa was one of the bright spots for much of the day after the credit card group reiterated earnings forecasts for next year, but it too succumbed to stand 2 per cent lower at $52.09 by the close.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 2.9 per cent at 873.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.2 per cent lower at 8,565.09 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 3.7 per cent weaker at 1,507.88.Advances in oil stocks had helped the wider market stay broadly flat for much of a session as crude rose sharply ahead of the Opec meeting next week.However, the sector finished lower after a heavy sell-off into the close. Exxon Mobil, at one point on course for its highest close since August, finished 0.1 per cent lower at $80.02.Elsewhere, glum economic data, downbeat corporate outlooks and signs that political wrangling could delay a bail-out of the ailing car industry held the market back.General Motors and Ford fell 10.4 per cent to $4.12 and 10.8 per cent to $2.90, respectively, amid fears that Republican critics could scupper $14bn in emergency loans to the industry.“The risk of Senate non-passage remains substantial,” wrote JPMorgan’s car manufacturing analysts in a note to clients.Meanwhile, the number of new workers filing claims for unemployment benefits jumped more than forecast last week to a 26-year high, according to the Labor Department. The figures came after traders were shocked by last week’s non-farm payrolls figures, which showed the biggest drop in 34 years.Meanwhile, industrial stocks suffered following a glut of gloomy news from companies in the sector.Reduced earnings guidance from Cummins and Stanley Works pushed shares in the pair down 7.1 per cent to $24.92 and 5.9 per cent to $32.30, respectively. The sector was one of the worst performing, down 4.2 per cent overall.Consumer stocks also performed badly. Among the heaviest losses, Urban Outfitters sank 20.6 per cent to $14.98 after the clothing and housewares retailer warned sales could worsen over the crucial festive season.Costco lost 3 per cent to $52.06 even after the warehouse chain said quarterly profit rose slightly, as strong results from its petrol stations helped the figures.Lorillard, down 3.9 per cent to $58.70, was among the losers in tobacco stocks after Goldman Sachs downgraded its view of the sector to “neutral”.Goldman analysts warned that a probable increase in excise tax could push volumes down 7 per cent next year.

By Joseph Cummins
Murdoch Books £16.99, 368 pages
FT Bookshop price: £13.59With its jaunty tone, neat design and tangential annotations, Great Rivals proves that popular history can be both accessible and insightful.Building chronologically from the BCE clash between Alexander the Great and King Darius III of Persia, to the deeply personal animosity between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, the book charts the complex rivalries that have shaped and shifted world history.“In a very real sense,” writes Joseph Cummins, “these rivals made us who we are today.”Latter chapters deal with the likes of Stalin and Trotsky, Hitler and Röhm and it’s all too easy to see how the tremors generated by ancient enmities still reverberate.That New Jersey-based Cummins is also a blogger on the current US election, gives what is essentially a historical cut-and-paste job, broader, more contemporary resonance."
49;CMI;Cummins Inc;2008-07-07T20:44:48Z;Wall Street falls as financials sell off;;US stocks fell on Monday in a volatile session of trading as a rout in the financial sector left broader equity markets poised on the brink of bear territory.The S&P 500 briefly dropped more than 20 per cent from its peak – the definition of a bear market – before recovering slightly. The index has now fallen more than 14 per cent for the year to date.The benchmark S&P 500 gained as much as 0.9 per cent and lost as much as 1.8 per cent before closing down 0.8 per cent at 1,252.30 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5 per cent to 11,231.96 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,243.32 points, taking both indices back into bear market territory.In financials, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities, led the retreat. They fell as much as 26 per cent and 29 per cent respectively after analysts at Lehman Brothers said that an accounting change could force them to raise extra capital. By the close, Fannie and Freddie were down 16.2 per cent to $15.74 and 17.9 per cent to $11.91.The banking sector took blows across the board as investment banks and regional banks were hit by more analysts downgrades.An analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey pointed to a number of banks, including SunTrust Banks and First Horizon, as having significant exposure to problematic residential construction loans.Lehman also came under pressure after reports that Platts, the energy-pricing company, had put the firm under a review that excludes it from trading some oil contracts. Lehman dropped 8.8 per cent to $20.84.SunTrust dropped 9.1 per cent to $31.74 and First Horizon tumbled 11.3 per cent to $6.27.The banking sector as a whole dipped 3.2 per cent touching its lowest level since October 2002 along the way while an index of investment banks lost 4.1 per cent.Richard Parker, managing director of institutional sales and trading at Stanford Financial, said: “Everyone is looking for any sort of reason to sell . . . There are just no catalysts that could take this market higher while anything negative leads to a knee-jerk reaction.”The day began in positive fashion with a $4 fall in crude oil prices helping carmakers and other consumer-facing stocks to advance.Ford rose 1.1 per cent to $4.47 while Dillard’s added 3.2 per cent to $10.48 and JC Penney gained 1.7 per cent to $37.30.Deal news also provided positive momentum. General Electric added 0.7 per cent to $27.10 after NBC Universal, its media unit, agreed to buy the Weather Channel along with two buy-out groups.Technology was the only sector to make significant gains, however, adding 0.8 per cent on news that Microsoft would consider reopening talks with Yahoo if activist investor Carl Icahn succeeded in replacing the board.Yahoo shares surged 12 per cent to $23.91 while Microsoft rose 0.2 per cent to $26.03.A round of analyst upgrades and positive writeups for the likes of Broadcom, NetApp and Apple, added to the advance. Broadcom rose 7.1 per cent to $28.09, NetApp added 5.5 per cent to $23.15 and Apple climbed 3 per cent to $175.16.Heavily sold industrial and materials stocks also made something of a comeback.In industrials, heavy goods manufacturers Terex and Cummins added 3.7 per cent to $47.60 and 3.8 per cent to $64.05 respectively.In materials, steel stocks led the way after Goldman Sachs said fundamentals remained strong in the industry.US Steel rose 1.3 per cent to $157.75 while Nucor rose 5.6 per cent to $66.07. Energy stocks fared less well, falling as oil prices slipped.Exxon Mobil fell 1.5 per cent to $86.95 while Chevron lost 1.8 per cent to $96.82 and the sector slipped 2.3 per cent.This week marks the un-official start of second-quarter earnings season with Alcoa due to report its results on Tuesday.Analysts currently expect earnings to decline 12.4 per cent compared to last year, according to Thomson Reuters.Should that happen, it would be the first time the S&P 500 has recorded four consecutive quarters of negative growth since 2002.
50;CMI;Cummins Inc;2008-06-30T18:03:14Z;Wall Street ends month on dismal note;;New York stocks bounced back modestly on Monday as soaring oil prices boosted energy stocks but the rally was too little, too late to prevent the S&P 500 from registering its worst month since September 2002.The relentless rise in oil prices has been the scourge of stock markets this month, undercutting investor confidence with the threat of inflation and turning modest gains in April and May into significant losses in June.Oil, which hit $143 a barrel in early trading before easing back, took its toll on consumer-facing stocks again on Monday.Expedia which was also knocked by a price target cut from Citigroup, fell back 3.4 per cent to $18.51, while Hasbro also lost 1.3 per cent to $35.59. Ford and General Motorswere also hard hit tumbling 4.8 per cent to $4.74 and 3.5 per cent to $11.13 respectively. The consumer discretionary sector gave up 0.4 per cent.Gains for oil producers however helped broader indices advance. Exxon Mobiland Conoco­Phillips added 1.1 per cent to $87.52 and 2.5 per cent to $94.13 respectively, while the sector climbed 1.6 per cent.The positive momentum was reinforced after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its measure of business activity in the Midwest improved in June, calming fears that output would collapse as the slowdown takes its toll.Industrials rallied 0.7 per cent on the news. UPS added 1.7 per cent to $61.38 and Cummins climbed 2.8 per cent to $66.16.Strength in the telecommunications and healthcare sectors, which added 3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, helped offset further weakness in financials. The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day 0.1 per cent ahead at 1,280 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat at 11,350.01. The Nasdaq Composite fell back 1 per cent to 2,292.98Last week, surging oil prices, poor earnings reports from the technology sector and a slump in financials pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Index into bear market territory and the S&P 500 to within a hair’s breadth of its March lows.That pattern was repeated yesterday. The Dow fell to its lowest level since September 2006 – down more than 20 per cent from its October highs – before recovering. The index is down 7.2 per cent over the quarter and 10 per cent so far this month – its worst June performance since the Great Depression.The S&P 500 fared little better. Technical analysts had warned that if the index broke through its March lows, it could retest its 2002 depths, but the recent bottom held. However, the index is still down 8.4 per cent over the month so far and 3 per cent over the quarter.One bright spot yesterday morning though was better-than-expected results from H&R Block. The US tax preparer reported its first quarterly profit in two years, thanks to the sale of its loan servicing unit. H&R rose 3.2 per cent to $21.49.Campbell Soup also cheered investors with news that it plans to buy back up to $1.2bn of stock by 2011. The shares climbed 5.2 per cent to $33.86.Analysts expect second quarter earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole to decline 11.3 per cent – marking the first time that the index has recorded four consecutive quarters of negative growth since 2002. At the start of the year, analysts were forecasting growth of 4.7 per cent.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, says that, even with those revisions, full-year earnings predictions are too high as tighter credit conditions will have an impact on industrial activity.Telecoms were the leading gainers on the S&P 500. Sprint Nextel led the pack, adding 4.9 per cent to $9.35 after reports that its Instinct phone was proving popular. Verizon rose 2.5 per cent to $35.13, while AT&T gained 1.3 per cent to $33.19.The travails of the financial sector continued to weigh on sentiment. Bond insurer MBIA was among the biggest fallers, dropping 8.9 per cent to $3.80 after a report that it is selling municipal bonds to raise cash. Peer Ambac slumped 22.4 per cent to $1.25.Wachovia was the worst performing bank, dropping 4.9 per cent to $15.43 after analysts said it might cut its dividend.
51;CMI;Cummins Inc;2008-06-12T20:42:38Z;Wall St gains trimmed by oil rally;;"Wall Street stocks bounced back on Thursday as investors cheered takeover bid news and some better-than-expected retail sales data, but a late rally in oil prices pared gains at the close.In a largely positive day of trading the mood was barely dented by news that Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, had replaced Erin Callan and Joseph Gregory, its chief financial and chief operating officers, respectively.On Monday, Lehman spooked markets by pre-announcing a second-quarter loss and raising $6bn to help it survive the credit crunch. Its share price has been under siege ever since and has lost over 30 per cent of its value in the past week.Lehman shares fell 4.4 per cent to $22.70 but the news proved cathartic for the broader financials sector, which rallied as much as 3.6 per cent before falling back slightly to close 2 per cent higher.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 0.3 per cent higher at 1,339.87 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent at 12,141.58. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,404.35.Wall Street had fallen sharply on Wednesday as financials resumed their relentless downward path and technology stocks came under selling pressure after a key industry group cut its sales outlook for semiconductors.Thursday, however, began in upbeat fashion after InBev, the Belgian brewer, said it had offered $46.3bn in cash for Anheuser-Busch. InBev plans to fund the unsolicited bid with $40bn of debt, highlighting that bank financing remains available for the right deals.Anheuser jumped 5.2 per cent to $61.40 and the news lifted the consumer staples sector 0.6 per cent.Consumer-facing stocks more generally received a boost from a dip in oil prices and the latest retail sales data for May. According to the Commerce Department last month, retail sales rose twice as fast as forecast, spurred on by tax rebates.At present, consumer spending remains weak but has not entirely capitulated, thanks in part to the rebate cheques – a key part of President George W. Bush’s economic stimulus package.Among retailers, Office Depot rose 5.5 per cent to $12.53, Limited Brands added 3.3 per cent to $17.72 and Kohl’s gained 3 per cent to $43.88. The consumer discretionary sector advanced
0.7 per cent.Still, observers warned that the stimulus from the rebate cheques would not last forever.Lehman Brothers analysts said: “We expect the rebate to boost spending over the next few months. But we expect it to be temporary, acting like a shot of caffeine by boosting growth in the third quarter but pushing growth to negative territory in the fourth quarter as the caffeine kick fades.”Moreover, the macroeconomic news was not all good and gains were limited by a bump in the number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits.But it was the unlikely rebound in the banking sector that hogged the spotlight. Citigroup rallied 3.5 per cent to $19.89, JPMorgan added 2.4 per cent to $38.01 and Bank of America rose 2.1 per cent to $29.44. An index of investment banking stocks gained 2 per cent.Earlier in the day, strategists at Morgan Stanley upgraded financial stocks from underweight to neutral, arguing that lower interest rates and a correction in property prices had improved fundamental conditions, while banks were deleveraging.KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, was the exception, slumping 23.7 per cent to $11.98 after the bank said it would cut its dividend and raise $1.5bn after losing a tax case that will result in a second-quarter charge of as much as $1.2bn.Technology stocks were in focus on Thursday after Yahoo said it had ended all talks with Microsoft. Yahoo shares plunged 9.8 per cent to $23.59 but the sector held its ground as Microsoft advanced 4.1 per cent and Google popped 1.4 per cent to $552.95 on speculation it would step in and partner with Yahoo.In industrials, Cummins, the maker of heavy-duty truck engines, stood out, soaring 9.9 per cent to $69.38 after rival Caterpillar said it would pull out of a key market segment.Energy was one of the few sectors to cede ground, falling 1.8 per cent in spite of the rise in oil prices. ExxonMobil fell 1.2 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.7 per cent to $92.49."
52;CMI;Cummins Inc;2008-06-12T18:54:36Z;Caterpillar to quit US engine market;;The shake-up in the global truck industry took another step forward on Thursday, as Caterpillar announced its withdrawal as a supplier of engines to US truck makers and said it would pursue a global joint venture with Navistar International.The two companies plan to produce medium and heavy-duty commercial trucks outside North America. But Caterpillar will in future focus its North American truck business on the joint development of a “severe service” off-highway vehicle used for road construction, large infrastructure projects and oil development.Questions have hung over Caterpillar’s North American truck-engine business for some time. Its market share has declined and one of its biggest customers, Paccar, builder of the Peterbilt and Kenworth brands, is currently building its own engine plant in Mississippi.The slowing US economy has severely dented demand for new trucks, and truck makers face heavy investments to comply with tighter US diesel emission regulations that take effect in 2010.Caterpillar does not disclose engine sales volumes. Sales to truck makers made up 9 per cent of its worldwide total last year, behind industrial, power-generation, oilfield and marine users. Caterpillar also produces engines for its own construction and mining equipment.Caterpillar’s planned withdrawal from the US on-highway truck market boosted shares of Cummins, one of its chief rivals, by 14 per cent in early trading on Thursday.Navistar said that the joint venture would combine its expertise in truck design, development and manufacturing, with Caterpillar’s 4,700 distributors around the world.Navistar has a significant presence in Mexico, Chile and South Africa, as well as a manufacturing joint venture with India’s Mahindra & Mahindra. But it has lacked resources to expand into other parts of the world.The latest deal “allows us to reach the entire world using Caterpillar’s distribution base”, Dan Ustian, Navistar’s chief executive, said on Thursday. “Maybe China will be the first place”, he added.The two companies have set up teams to assess truck and engine opportunities.Navistar said that the deal with Caterpillar would have no impact on its project with Germany’s MAN to build heavy-duty truck engines at a plant now under construction in Alabama.Volkswagen owns 30 per cent of MAN. Oliver Dixon, a truck-industry consultant, suggested that the German carmaker might at some point consider selling its stake to Caterpillar and Navistar.Caterpillar shares gained 2.7 per cent to $81.06 in early trading. Navistar was almost 4 per cent higher at $74.70.The consolidation of the truck industry is already well advanced in other parts of the world. A prolonged takeover battle for Sweden’s Scania, one of the industry’s most profitable players, ended in March, with Volkwagen buying a stake previously held by the Wallenberg family.
53;CMI;Cummins Inc;2008-04-30T20:11:03Z;Wall St falls as cheer fades;;A rally on Wall Street guttered at the close on Wednesday after investors absorbed a widely anticipated interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve but read further economic weakness into an ambiguous accompanying statement.Still, in April as a whole, the S&P 500 added about 4.8 per cent thanks to strong results from the likes of Google that have helped ease fears about the likely fallout from a US slowdown.That performance marks the index’s best monthly showing since the end of 2003 and its first positive month since last October.The day began in upbeat mood as investors took better-than expected employment data and a mixed growth report in their stride.According to the Commerce Department, the US economy only narrowly avoided outright contraction in the first quarter, growing at a sluggish 0.6 per cent. On the positive side, core prices, a measure of inflation, rose a less-than-expected 2.2 per cent.In mid-afternoon, the Federal Open Markets Committee cut its main interest rate 25 basis points to 2 per cent as expected. The S&P 500 spiked as much as 1 per cent before staging a sharp retreat.Analysts broadly predicted that a stabilising outlook would prompt the Fed to signal a temporary halt to future rate-cutting, but the statement released alongside the decision equivocated, stirring concerns about the health of the economy.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent on Wednesday at 1,385.45 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 12,818.67. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,412.80.The day’s portion of earnings reports exemplified the surprising resilience that many companies have shown during the first-quarter earnings season, particularly large caps with an exposure to foreign markets.Industrials have climbed 1.3 per cent over the month and on Wednesday estimate-beating results from Ingersoll-Rand and Cummins added to that trend. Ingersoll rose 4.3 per cent to $44.38 while Cummins gained 9 per cent to $62.65.Over the month though, energy stocks were the star performers, surging about 10.9 per cent as oil flirted with the $120 a barrel level and prices for coal and gas also rose.Oil services companies Smith International and Baker Hughes led the way, jumping 22.6 per cent to $76.56 and 20.1 per cent to $80.88, respectively.Technology stocks also had a banner month, rising 6.9 per cent after a number of industry bellwethers reported stronger-than-expected results.Google surged about 31.1 per cent to $574.29 while Micron Technology jumped about 41.4 per cent to $7.72 and Apple gained 21.6 per cent to $173.95.Still, Leo Kamp, chief economist at financial services company TIAA-CREF, said: “I think this is more of a bear market rally than a sustainable up tick. The reason is that earnings growth is going to be anaemic going forward and it is not going to give much a lift for equity markets. That is especially true for financials.”On Wednesday, financials were in focus afterCitigroup, the biggest US bank, announced plans to sell $4.5bn of stock to shore up its balance sheet. The shares slipped 4 per cent on Wednesday but were up by 21.3 per cent to $25.27 over the month.In April as a whole, the sector added 6.3 per cent thanks to deal activity and results that were not as bad as many feared from a handful of leading investment banks. Safeco, which agreed to be bought by Liberty Mutual for $6.2bn, jumped by over 50 per cent to $66.72 while Merrill Lynch rose 24.8 per cent to $49.83.Consumer staples rallied weakly on Wednesday thanks to a handful of better-than-expected results from the industry heavyweights, includingProcter & Gamble and Kraft Foods. But in April the sector was the laggard, falling 0.4 per cent. P&G shares rose 1.8 per cent to $67.05 while Kraft added 2.8 per cent to $31.61 on Wednesday.Throughout April, data have shown declining consumer confidence and anaemic consumer spending but the sector has performed vigorously.Over the month, Ford shares jumped by 47.8 per cent to $8.26 on an unanticipated swing into profits in the first-quarter while at General Motors, hit $23.20, adding nearly 25 per cent.
54;CMI;Cummins Inc;2007-09-27T17:00:12Z;Two-tier system to escape the long arm of US law;;Most chief executives of Aim companies will argue that their shares are undervalued, while investors will complain that small company stocks are illiquid. Both sides have a point, but the situation is even worse for the US companies that join the junior market.They have usually come to Aim to avoid the burden of Sarbanes-Oxley – but the land of the free has a long regulatory reach. It has been felt by Protonex, a US fuel cell company that floated on Aim in June last year. Whole weeks, if not months, have passed without a single share trading.Not even the announcement of a secondary fundraising and acquisition at the end of March prompted any market interest. That is in marked contrast to the volumes seen in other Aim-listed fuel cell companies such as Ceres Power Holdings, Ceramic Fuel Cells and ITM Power.Part of the reason is Regulation S of the US Securities Act of 1933. It effectively stops UK listed shares in a US-based company, which does not file accounts with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, from being traded through the Crest electronic settlement system.The restriction, which lasts for two years, stops US retail investors from buying the shares. At the same time many UK private client brokers refuse to deal in shares that have to be traded through an old-fashioned paper trail.Scott Pearson, Protonex’s chief executive, is unhappy with the liquidity of the shares. Not unreasonably, he believes that further value would be unlocked “if only we can get the shares trading”.This week the company, advised by Canaccord, took steps to alleviate the restriction. It is creating a second line of shares that have been in existence for more than two years. They are the shares that are held by venture capital and other original backers and which were issued well before the company arrived on Aim.Mr Pearson believes the creation of a two-tier quote structure will attract more investors and increase overall liquidity. It will allow 26 per cent of the 64.8m shares to be traded electronically through Crest.Fuel cells: a powerful ideaHowever, such arcane manoeuvres through the world of US regulation are likely to pass over the heads of most investors. They should pay more attention to Monday’s additional news that the company has teamed up with Cummins to work on a diesel-fuelled solid oxide fuel cell power system.Protonex is unusual within the embryonic fuel cell sector in that it is selling equipment to end users. The US military, which is less sensitive to price than the commercial sector, is keen on the quiet power source that does not emit much heat. One use is to drive unmanned spy aircraft.Total sales in the year ending September 30 are expected to be more than double last year’s, albeit at a lowly $5.8m (£2.9m). Cracking the commercial market would make a real impact.The $1.2m deal with Cummins is to develop auxiliary fuel-cell-powered generators for the huge trucks that criss-cross the US. They would kick in to power the air-conditioning, lights and television sets when the trucks lie up for the night.“This is big company verification of our strategy,” says Mr Pearson, who was in London this week for the 10th Grove fuel cell conference, one of the world’s leading events for the industry.It sparked announcements from other fuel cell companies, including PolyFuel, a Californian company specialising in membranes.PolyFuel can, of course, benefit only if and when companies such as Protonex succeed in boosting sales of products that use its membranes. Meanwhile it continues its research, as well as increasing supplies of membranes to other developers of fuel cell systems.Jim Balcom, chief executive, says shipments in the first half were more than twice those delivered in the whole of last year.However, he is more excited by the company’s development of a fuel cell stack capable of producing 500 watts per litre of stack volume. The stack, fuelled by methanol, fits in the palm of a hand.“We can see the path for people to put it in a laptop computer in the not-too-distant future,” he says. “We are on the cusp of surpassing the performance of lithium ion batteries.”Mr Balcom also believes that Regulation S has been the primary reason for the limited liquidity in the company stock. However, PolyFuel shares escape the restrictions of Regulation S in January.There are more than 50 US companies operating under Regulation S. Most are pleased to have been able to come to Aim and raise funds. But even more might be tempted if a way could be found to permit electronic trading in the shares.david.blackwell@ft.com
55;CMI;Cummins Inc;2007-07-09T21:51:13Z;Wall St higher as earnings season starts;;Wall Street closed higher on Monday, with blue chips setting the pace ahead of the start of the second-quarter earnings season.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to close at 13,649.97.The S&P 500 index gained 0.1 per cent to finish at 1,531.86. Among the S&P’s 10 major sectors, energy led gains. Consumer discretionary and financials were lower.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,670.02.A boost for bluechips was Boeing, up 1 per cent at $99.90, as its Dreamliner aircraft was officially launched over the weekend and the company received further orders from various airlines.Johnson & Johnson rose 1 per cent to $62.72, after its board approved a stock repurchase of up to $10bn.In earnings news, Alcoa, another Dow component, posted a 3.9 per cent decline in quarterly profit compared with a year ago after the closing bell. While the result matched estimates, sales were less than expected. In after-hours trade, Alcoa was 1.3 per cent lower at $41.80, after the stock had risen 1.7 per cent to $42.36 in regular trade on Monday.Pepsi Bottling is due with earnings on Tuesday and the stock fell 0.3 per cent to $34.43 on Monday.General Electric, another Dow component, reports quarterly results on Friday.The earnings of the S&P 500 constituents are expected to rise 4.4 per cent for the second-quarter compared with the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Financial. Expectations for the quarter have risen from 3.9 per cent at the start of April, said John Butters, analyst at Thomson.Earnings growth estimates for energy companies in the second quarter have swung from a fall of 9 per cent to a rise of 3 per cent since April, according to Thomson.That swing has helped offset downward revisions in a number of other sectors. Since the start of April, expectations for consumer discretionary earnings have been lowered to a fall of 10 per cent from a decline of 4 per cent.Earnings estimates for companies in the consumer staples sector have eased from a gain of 9 per cent down to 4 per cent. Technology sector earnings areseen 9 per cent higher, down from a gain of 12 per cent forecast at the start of April.While consumer stocks have lagged behind the broad market’s recent gains, some analysts said concern over the sector might be misplaced. “Recent employment gains support the notion that the US consumer is alive and well and spending habits are unlikely to shift dramatically lower as is being presumed by many investors,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“Investors continue to worry most about consumer stocks, preferring global infrastructure beneficiaries in the mining, industrial and energy areas instead, but expectations are low and valuations are very attractive.”Many US companies are exposed to the global economy, which has been growing at a faster rate than the US. With a weaker dollar, analysts expect US companies with foreign operations to receive an earnings boost.This was highlighted by a survey by Standard & Poor’s of 238 companies in the S&P 500. The agency said these companies had made 44.2 per cent of their fiscal year 2006 sales from outside of the US. That represents a rise of 37 per cent since 2001.Analysts say stocks such as Caterpillar, the equipment manufacturer, and Terex, a construction equipment supplier, are both examples of companies that are benefiting from global growth. Caterpillar rose 1.3 per cent to $79.83 while Terex was 9.5 per cent higher at $92.70.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals‘s shares surged 52.1 per cent to $23.12, after the biotechnology company licensed some of its therapeutic research to Roche, the Swiss drug maker.On Monday, Lexmark, the computer printer maker, cut its second-quarter earnings outlook range and its stock fell 6.4 per cent to $46.25.In deals, the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, said it was taking Sequa, a diversified manufacturer, private for $2.7bn or $175 per share. The stock rose 52.6 per cent to $173.24.Huntsman, the chemical manufacturer, received a higher offer of $28 a share from Apollo Management, which previously offered $27.25 a share. The new price values the company at about $6.5bn and follows a $5.6bn bid last month from Basell, the Dutch chemicals group. Huntsman rose 0.3 per cent to $28.07.Lear gained 2.8 per cent at $36.85, after the car parts maker accepted a higher takeover offer of $3bn, valued at $37.25 a share, up from an original bid of $36, from Carl Icahn’s American Real Estate Partners.Late on Monday, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and CBOT Holdings announced that preliminary results indicated the shareholders of both companies had approved the proposed merger of the two derivatives exchanges. Shares in both exchanges were higher by around 0.5 per cent in after-hours trade. In regular trade on Monday, CME fell 0.7 per cent to close at $570.58, and the CBOT lost 0.5 per cent to $222.82.Meanwhile, Cummins, a maker of diesel engines for heavy trucks, surged 10.5 per cent to $117.64 and set a new 52-week of $120.18. Bear Stearns upgraded the company to ‘Outperform’ from ‘Peer Perform’ and said new emissions rules will boost demand for its products.LaBranche, rose 4.8 per cent to $7.87. The NYSE floor equity specialist announced a strategic review.
56;CMI;Cummins Inc;2007-01-10T20:23:51Z;Wal-Mart to develop hybrid trucks;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is to work with ArvinMeritor, the auto component supplier, on the development of a diesel-electric hybrid truck, as part of its new focus on improving its environmental performance.The companies said in a statement they had agreed to develope a dual-mode, diesel-electric drivetrain for a Class 8 tractor truck - the workhorse of the US long-distance trucking industry.The vehicle will be based on an International ProStar tractor, and powered by an engine developed by Cummins.The FT reported last July that the retailer has been working with Environmental Defense, a not-for-profit environmental group, on applying the technology used by passenger cars such as the Toyota Prius to the ubiquitous tractor unit.Carsten Reinhardt, president of ArvinMeritor’s commercial vehicle business, said the project “holds tremendous promise for the worldwide heavy-duty trucking market in a number of important environmental and economic ways.”The proposed dual-mode units will use electric motors powered by batteries to augment the power of their diesel engines, mainly during acceleration and hill climbing. The batteries are powered by electricity generated by energy created during braking.Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, set out ambitious environmental targets for the retailer last year, which included improving the efficiency of Wal-Mart’s fleet of more than 7,000 trucks by 25 per cent by 2008, and then doubling it by 2015.Currently, the Wal-Mart’s company’s fleet averages 6.5 mpg – better than the industry average.This year, the retailer is introducing more fuel-efficient conventional trucks that include aerodynamic side-skirts on its 53ft trailers, better tirestyres and auxiliary power units to reduce engine idling.The improvements are expected to improve fuel efficiency by no more than 13 per cent – with the retailer turning to hybrid power to provide further gains.Prototype and limited production hybrid engines have now been developed for a range of commercial vehicles, including delivery and garbage trucks. But heavy duty 18-wheelers have been seen as less suited to the technology which relies on braking and frequent stops to generate electrical or hydraulic power.Last year, Eaton, a rival of ArvinMeritor, said it had developed a prototype heavy duty truck that has improved fuel efficiency by 5-7 per cent.Heavy duty trucks accounted for around 18 per cent of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2003, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
57;CMI;Cummins Inc;2004-12-29T21:24:37Z;New-economy lifestyle boosts US tech stocks;;Some of the biggest brands of the technology bubble were among the best performing US stocks this year as the new-economy lifestyle continued to spread.It was as if everyone was sitting in Starbucks, listening to Apple iPods, while checking their Yahoo e-mail to see how they had fared in an eBay auction.All four stocks were in the top 20 performers in the Standard & Poor's 500 index with Apple Computer, maker of the leading portable music player, at No 2, with a gain of more than 200 per cent. Starbucks shares almost doubled, as they did in 2003, while eBay was up almost 80 per cent and Yahoo nearly 70 per cent.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said the stock performances reflected ?the market's reward for companies that are an integral part of everyday life?.Brands such as Apple and Starbucks define the daily routine of the new economy generation in the way Coca-Cola, General Electric and Sears, Roebuck did in the past. None of those companies made it into the top 100 performers of the S&P in 2004.Not that it was all about the new economy last year. Two old economy brands, Goodyear Tire & Rubber and Black & Decker, made the top 20. Goodyear, which is recovering after two years of losses, was helped by higher prices and buoyant demand for truck tyres in the US. Strong sales of heavy duty trucks in the US drove up Cummins, the diesel engine maker, whose shares rose more than 70 per cent.Two other big trends of the year, the surge in the oil price and the impact of China's growing appetite for raw materials, propelled some of the other stock winners. Four of the top 20 stocks in the S&P were energy companies, including TXU and Valero, while Nucor, the biggest maker of steel in the US, had a bumper year thanks to the doubling of the steel price.It was a bad year for large pharmaceuticals companies Merck was 481st in the index thanks to a 30 per cent fall in its share price but much better for the biotechnology sector.The winner, with a gain of 213.8 per cent, was Autodesk, the world's leading supplier of computer-aided design software for personal computers.The loser, with a decline of almost 50 per cent, was Ciena, the loss-making optical telecommunications equipment maker whose customers are still extremely cautious.
