0;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2019-04-18T17:26:09Z;Railroad stocks set record highs as price increases boost earnings;;Shares in US railroads are trading near all-time highs after a trio of America’s largest train operators steamrollered earnings forecasts this week, backed by higher shipping rates.Union Pacific, CSX and Kansas City Southern cheered investors with first-quarter results that benefited from price hikes and cost efficiencies, which offset the financial impact of disruptive winter storms and record Midwest flooding that caused billions of dollars in damage in the region.Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific kept the rally train moving on Thursday, revealing net income grew 6 per cent year-over-year to $1.39bn as rate increases helped the company overcome weaker volume. On an adjusted basis, earnings of $1.93 a share topped analysts’ average estimate by four cents, even as revenue of $5.4bn, down from $5.5bn, fell short.The company’s stock surged 4.5 per cent to $176.90 in intraday trade, higher than its previous closing high of $171.33 set on February 19.The Dow Jones US Railroads Index, up 2.6 per cent on Thursday, was also trading at an all-time high.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average — a closely watched index seen as a gauge of the US economy — was tracking toward its highest close in more than 6 months with a gain of 1.7 per cent to 11,007.09.CFRA analyst Jim Corridore, who raised his price targets for all three companies this week, said CSX and Kansas City Southern have improved profitability with a shift to scheduled railroading — when trains depart at a set time as opposed to waiting for a certain number of cars.“CSX’s shift to scheduled railroading has driven declines in headcount, fuel costs and most other cost categories, and these benefits are likely to continue through 2019,” he wrote to clients.Mr Corridore remained concerned about carload declines at Union Pacific, saying it would likely lag behind other railroads on its operating ratio while it rolls out an improvement plan. The company’s operating ratio, a key industry measure of profitability, improved 1 percentage point to 63.6 per cent last quarter. CSX’s operating ratio was a first-quarter record for the group at 59.5 per cent. A lower number indicates stronger profitability.CSX booked revenue growth of 5 per cent in the March quarter on “broad-based pricing gains” and increased shipping volume in merchandise. Its net earnings expanded by 20 per cent.First-quarter revenues at Kansas City Southern rose 6 per cent amid strong gains in chemicals and petroleum shipments, while net earnings, which fell 29 per cent, were knocked by restructuring charges. Excluding one-time costs, adjusted earnings per share rose 18 per cent.Kansas City Southern shares jumped 1.5 per cent to $124.71, about 1 per cent from its closing high and setting a pace to wrap trading at its best level since November 2014. CSX ticked fractionally lower during the session after setting a record high on Wednesday.Not to be left out, Norfolk Southern, which will report first-quarter results next week, rose 1.2 per cent and eyed a fresh record high on its peers’ upbeat views.

He suggested shareholders could either pass a motion demanding the board consider CP’s offer or propose alternative directors.“I think the annual meeting is the most likely timeframe — and the simplest one — for getting a transaction done,” Mr Ackman said.CP is offering a mix of cash and shares for NS that the target company values at $91.62 per share, valuing the company’s equity at $27.3bn. CP contends that the offer is worth between $125 and $140 a share.NS said it would “carefully consider” the revised offer, which, in addition to terms announced last week — $32.86 cash per share and 0.451 of a share in the new, merged company — would offer shareholders a “contingent value right” in the new company. The CVR would offer shareholders up to $25 a share if the new company’s shares are below $175 a share in October 2017. CP projects that the shares will be worth between $204 and $237 each, depending on whether the deal wins regulatory approval.NS said that, other than the CVR, the deal changed nothing compared with the previous offer that NS’s board unanimously rejected.NS’s shares had fallen 1.8 per cent to $89.39 by lunchtime in New York. CP’s shares rose 0.4 per cent in New York to $125.56.NS has consistently dismissed the idea of further consolidation among the seven Class I railroads in the US and Canada, saying it would be impossible to gain approval from the US’s Surface Transportation Board. A series of mergers in the 1990s left just Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe in the western US; Norfolk Southern and CSX in the eastern US; CP and Canadian National in Canada; and Kansas City Southern operating north to south.Mr Ackman portrayed the transaction as having two parts. CP would first take management control of NS, as early as May next year, and put Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, in charge of improving NS operations. The second stage — after at least 18 months of working for regulatory approval — would involve merging the companies’ operations.Mr Ackman suggested other railroads were also warming to the idea of new mergers. He said CSX, which CP approached last year, had put itself up for sale. CSX denied having done so. He also suggested that BNSF was considering participating in mergers, although the company — like Union Pacific — has stressed it opposes new mergers."
2;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2015-11-17T23:24:36Z;Norfolk Southern criticises ‘highly conditional’ bid from CP;US railroad says offer values it about $28.3bn, less than 10 per cent premium to trading price;Norfolk Southern on Tuesday criticised an “unsolicited, low-premium, non-binding and highly conditional” potential bid from Canadian Pacific that would value the US’s fourth-biggest railroad network at around $28.3bn.But the US railroad said it would “carefully evaluate and consider” the bid from Canada’s number two railroad, aimed at creating the first railroad able to operate all the way across the US and Canada from the Pacific to the Atlantic.NS was reacting to CP’s confirmation hours earlier that it had formally written to NS to express interest in a merger. CP had said in its statement — which followed speculation on November 9 that it was considering a bid — that its offer would offer “a sizeable premium in cash and stock for NS shareholders”. CP had not disclosed the precise price it was offering.NS said CP was offering $46.72 in cash and 0.348 CP shares for every NS share. At Tuesday’s $135.58 closing price for CP in New York, the deal would offer a combined $94.94 per share, valuing the whole company at $28.3bn. NS’s shares closed at $86.97 on Tuesday in New York. They initially surged more than 6 per cent in after-market trading on CP’s confirmation of its approach. But they later pared those gains on news of the exact proposed terms and were 3.4 per cent up at $89.90 at 7pm.NS said the price offered a premium of less than 10 per cent to Tuesday’s share price — although the shares stood at only $79.90 before news of a possible approach first emerged.NS said it would consider the approach in the context of NS’s “strategic plans, and its ongoing review of opportunities to enhance stockholder value through strategic, financial and operational measures and pursue the best interests of the company and its stockholders.”CP had said in its statement that it would offer other railroads access to its network if its service levels declined or prices rose following a merger. The provision is designed to short circuit expected opposition from regulators and customers to a merger, which would be the first between the big Class I railroads in the US and Canada since 1999.NS nevertheless expressed doubt about the potential for winning approval. The industry’s current structure— with CSX and NS in the eastern US, Union Pacific and BNSF in the west, CP and Canadian National in Canada and Kansas City Southern operating north-south — is widely regarded as highly consolidated.“Any consolidation among Class I railroads in North America would face significant regulatory hurdles,” NS said.Tony Hatch, an independent railroad expert, said CP’s access suggestion was a surprise.“It has been expected that this would be the response by regulators [to a merger proposal],” Mr Hatch said of the proposal to open up the network. “It is, I will have to admit, a surprising tactic to put it out there at first.”An opening up of the combined company’s network to competitors could help to counter objections from shipper groups that customer service at CP under Hunter Harrison, chief executive since 2012, has worsened. Mr Harrison — one of the industry’s most admired executives, a former chief executive of Canadian National — has vastly improved the network’s efficiency but irritated some shipper groups who thought their needs had been neglected.The NS bid is CP’s second for another North American railroad under Mr Harrison. The company last October approached CSX but was rebuffed..

Railroads are a crucial part of its circulatory system. Yet shares in the biggest rail companies — Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern — are down by about a quarter so far this year. Relative to expected earnings, the shares are the cheapest they have been in two years. Surely, then, the value train is pulling into the station?No. The problem is an industry-wide gap between depreciation (the item on the income statement reflecting consumption of fixed capital) and capital expenditure (the cash the companies spend on fixed capital). When depreciation is less than capex, cash generation lags behind reported earnings (because capex is a cash expense and depreciation is not). For the railroads, the gap is longstanding but has widened notably over the past decade. This makes a certain amount of sense, given the industry’s solid growth: capex rises first when companies expand. But in general, depreciation and capex should converge as growth normalises.And growth is normalising, to put it kindly. Coal shipments have fallen badly, agricultural volumes are soft and a strong dollar does not help shipments to the country’s ports and borders. Sales at the big four are expected to fall this year, earnings will be flat to down. The market took lagging cash in its stride while the industry was expanding. But as growth investors and momentum-chasers look elsewhere, and value investors start assessing the stocks, the question is going to be asked: when is capex going to come down? Because at 30 or more times free cash flow, value investors are not going to consider these stocks cheap. And, with the exception of Kansas City Southern, capex has risen in the first half of this year.Last year, all four companies spent more on dividends and share buybacks than they generated in free cash. So they are adding leverage, too. Their debt loads are not too heavy but adding debt to please investors can only go on for so long. Increasing cash flow then becomes even more crucial.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
4;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2015-03-26T19:04:46Z;Dow Transports puts shadow on US equities;Barometer of economy and overall sentiment lags broader market;Investors are shunning US transport stocks and this barometer of the economy and overall equity sentiment on Thursday continued lagging the broad market.Investors have turned cold on transport equities since the start of the year, discouraged by weakening economic reports that have forced economists to downgrade their forecasts for the world’s biggest economy.The shift by investors accompanies spotty performance for some of the sector’s biggest companies after bumper returns in 2013 and 2014. Shares of UPS, Avis and Kansas City Southern have all fallen more than 10 per cent, while two-thirds of the Dow Jones Transportation Average members have declined since the start of the year.The Dow Transports retreat casts a cloud over the broader equity market as a bullish or bearish trend is flagged whenever the benchmark rallies or declines sharply. This is based on the notion that transport stocks reflect the underlying economy far better than the average company and thus foreshadow prospects for economic growth.Analysts with JPMorgan said a stronger dollar has crimped export activity, which is a key component of the rail business. Credit Suisse, which remains bullish on the rail industry, noted that a slide in energy prices has weighed on deliveries of coal and crude oil products.“We have witnessed the impact in the past few weeks during which CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern have each experienced notable year-over-year declines in coal,” said Allison Landry, an analyst with Credit Suisse.She added: “This, in conjunction with a step down in shale-related volumes relative to the beginning of the quarter, potentially leading to extra costs related to a mismatch in the resource-to-demand equation, will likely result in downward first-quarter earnings revisions.”That left Dow Transports on course for lagging its namesake counterpart for a fifth consecutive day on Thursday. The benchmark has registered a fall of almost 5 per cent this year, reflecting in part investors increasing bearish or so-called short positions in transport companies after two years of double-digit gains.Shares of SPDR S&P Transport ETF constituents, which includes CSX, FedEx and Avis Budget, on loan to short the underlying stock have climbed 33 basis points from a low touched in January. At 3.4 per cent, the figure was the highest since the middle of November, according to data provider Markit.The case for transport stocks rests largely on wider US and global activity as the rail and shipping behemoths depend on increases in trade to fill rail cars and cargo holds.Retailers have warned that port disputes on the US West Coast have stunted supply chains, prompting companies including Union Pacific to forecast first-quarter volumes that will be flat to slightly down as it takes weeks to clear inventory backlogs.The strength of the dollar is also weighing on export-heavy industries, including semiconductors, as big corporations put systems upgrades on hold.“Foreign demand should be cut as long as [the] dollar stays in this area,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “Until we have consistent strength in the economy, domestic companies may say, ‘Let’s hold off a little bit’.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
5;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2014-03-18T11:46:26Z;Dispute erupts over Mexico’s railway concessions bill;;As Mexico’s antitrust bill arrives in Congress, a dispute has erupted over a rail bill that would alter the terms of the two main railway concessions.The lower house has passed the rail legislation, which deals with the concessions held by subsidiaries of Grupo México, the mining company, and Kansas City Southern, transport group. The bill is now before the Senate.The companies fear their rights and the rule of law risk being eroded, while legislators complain a lack of interconnection adds hundreds of miles and costly delays to freight journeys. In addition, while tariffs have increased as much as eight times in recent years, the network has not been expanded.However, a study by Cidac, a think-tank, argued that the issue is not black and white. Though the study agreed that some changes were overdue, it also pointed out that it would be more effective to focus on the structure of tariffs than to change the way the railways are operated.That, it warned, “would generate a series of economic inefficiencies affecting other sectors and the national economy”.Mexico’s Congress this week begins debating a “flawed” antitrust bill that economic and legal experts warn could punish companies simply for being too successful, damaging the country’s business-friendly reputation.Some fear the bill, which is aimed at stopping companies from achieving market dominance through illegal monopolistic practices, could actually lead to less, not more, competition . . .Continue readingIndeed, a report by the OECD found Mexico’s rail privatisation in 1995 had led to a doubling of traffic and “we see no evidence of misuse of railway market power”.Mexico has no shortage of inefficiencies and has begun to tackle domestic vested interests.However, shifting the terms partway through a concession “does not bode well” for investor sentiment as Mexico opens up its energy sector, said one former government official.“Investors are less worried about violence and drugs trafficking than the rules changing as they go along,” he noted.Meanwhile, the debate over the antitrust bill, which is aimed at stopping companies from achieving market dominance through illegal monopolistic practices, is raising its own concerns that it could actually lead to less, not more, competition in Mexico
6;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2014-02-18T17:42:00Z;US housebuilders hurt by fall in sentiment;;Shares in US homebuilders retreated on Tuesday as confidence among builders fell to its lowest level in nine months amid frigid winter conditions that stifled buying activity.The report, from the National Association of Home Builders, showed sentiment fell by its sharpest rate on record, which the group has been conducting for more than 25 years.The index, which measures homebuilders’ current and future expectations for sales as well as buyer traffic, fell 10 points to 46. A reading below 50 indicates more homebuilders view the market as poor than good.Wall Street economists expected a reading of 56, unchanged from sentiment readings in JanuaryThe figures dented investor appetite in several homebuilders. Shares in DR Horton dipped as much as 4 per cent before closing 1.31 per cent lower at $23.31, while Lennar declined 2 per cent before paring its losses and ending 0.82 per cent off at $41.14.“This report is yet another indication of the profound impact that the cold and wintry weather is having on a broad swath of the economy, and while we expect this hiccup to growth to prove temporary, it will be sometime before the data begin to show a meaningful rebound in activity,” TD Securities strategist Millan Mulraine said.Kansas City Southern led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 index, after analysts at JPMorgan Chase downgraded the firm to neutral from buy on concerns new Mexican legislation could force rail operators to share their lines with competitors.While the bill still must clear the Senate, it would require concession-holders, including Kansas City Southern and Grupo Mexico’s Ferromex and Ferrosur railroads, to open their systems and publish prices charged to third-party operators. It would allow the government to revoke a concession under certain conditions.Shares in Kansas City fell 4.5 per cent to $91.64.Coca-Cola was also pressured on Tuesday, after the drinks behemoth said it would find another $1bn in cost savings by 2016 to put into “increased media investments”.A further squeeze on costs came as Coke’s profits dropped to $1.7bn in the final quarter of last year from $1.9bn in the same period a year earlier. Revenues edged 4 per cent lower to $11bn.Global shipments of its beverages climbed 1 per cent in the final three months of the year, though a 1 per cent drop in volumes in North America dragged on the company’s overall performance. Coca-Cola faces a headache in its own backyard as Americans increasingly favour alternatives to the fizzy drinks that the company built its fortune on.The company’s stock declined 3.78 per cent to end at $37.46.Waste Management shares weakened after the company’s profit forecasts for the coming year came in shy of analyst expectations.The garbage and recycling collector said earnings per share in 2014 would range between $2.30 and $2.35, more than a nickel below Wall Street forecasts.The figures came as Waste Management swung to a loss of $605m, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to a $224m profit a year earlier. The quarter included impairments and writedowns of $865m as the company cut the goodwill it attached to its waste-to-energy business, among other charges. Sales in the fourth quarter rose 2 per cent from a year earlier to $3.5bn.Shares fell 4.44 per cent to $41.73.Overall, US equity markets were little changed to start the week, as an index of manufacturing in the New York region showed slowing growth in February.The S&P 500 rose 0.12 per cent to 1,840.76 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.15 per cent lower at 16,130.40. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.68 per cent to end at 4,272.78.
7;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2013-01-22T23:28:02Z;Shift away from coal hits US rail groups;;Both large rail operators in the eastern US reported lower fourth-quarter profits as plummeting demand for utility coal outweighed price and profitability improvements for the wider industry.The announcements from CSX and Norfolk Southern came as Canadian National, one of North America’s most respected rail operators, said it planned to double its crude oil traffic this yea r compared with last year. Kansas City Southern, smallest of the seven Class I rail companies that dominate North America’s rail industry, also reported a quadrupling of its crude oil volumes for the fourth quarter, alongside a 23 per cent fall in utility coal traffic for power stations.All four companies are experiencing the effects of a sudden shift away from coal use in US power stations, in favour of newly cheap and abundant natural gas. All are seeking opportunities to ship the fine fracking sand used to release gas and oil and to move the crude oil that emerges.CSX, operator of the main rail network east of the Mississippi, said net earnings for the quarter to December 28 fell 3 per cent to $443m on revenue down 2 per cent to $2.88bn. Full-year earnings rose 2 per cent to $1.86bn on revenue flat at $11.8bn.Norfolk Southern, the other big eastern network, announced fourth-quarter net income down 14 per cent to $413m on revenue down 4 per cent to $2.68bn. Its full-year net income fell 8.7 per cent to $1.75bn on revenue down 1.2 per cent to $11bn.CSX’s coal volumes declined 19 per cent for the quarter over last year’s fourth quarter, dragging coal revenue down 18 per cent to $747m. NS’s coal volume for the period fell 13.2 per cent, while revenues fell 23 per cent to $657m.Michael Ward, CSX’s chief executive, said the company continued to demonstrate the ability to respond quickly to significant events in the marketplace. Wick Moorman, NS’s chief executive, said that, despite the declines in coal shipments, it had seen steady gains in intermodal traffic – carrying containers and trailers – chemicals, automotive and materials for housebuilding.“We remain focused on controlling costs and improving productivity while continuing to provide high service levels for our customers,” Mr Moorman said.CN gave its commitment to double crude oil volumes over the current year, as it reported petroleum and chemicals volumes for the last quarter of 2012 up 19 per cent on the previous year and revenues up 13 per cent.CN – which mainly caters to the growing market for export coal, rather than the utility coal that CSX and NS mainly carry – also reported coal volumes for the fourth quarter 23 per cent up year-on-year and revenues up 15 per cent.CN’s net income for the fourth quarter rose 3 per cent to C$610m ($616m) on revenues up 6 per cent to C$2.53bn ($2.55bn). Net income for the year rose 9.1 per cent to C$2.68bn on revenue up 9.9 per cent to C$9.92bn.
8;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2011-08-22T17:24:21Z;The biggest North American railroads;;The US and Canadian railroad industry is dominated by the seven “Class I” railroads, most of them formed as a result of a wave of consolidation in the 1980s and 1990s.In order of 2010 operating revenue, they are:1. Union Pacific: $17bnStill operator of the largest route network of any Class I, Union Pacific is also the only one able to trace its history back to the earliest years of the US railroads, having been formed in 1862 to build the eastern end of the historic Iowa to California trans-continental railroad. It was transformed, however, by its 1996 merger with Southern Pacific. Operating west of the Mississippi, UP depends heavily on hauling containers from west coast ports, on hauling coal from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin and transporting mid-western grain and other bulk products.2. BNSF: $16.8bnThe Burlington Northern and Santa Fe is currently most famous for being owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle, which bought it in 2009. However, the railroad, product of a 1995 merger between Burlington Northern and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads, was already well-known in the industry for running a highly efficient railroad – which now rivals Union Pacific in revenue despite having a smaller network.3. CSX: $10.6bnCSX, operator of the largest railroad network east of the Mississippi, depends heavily on the region’s industrial base for its traffic. The company divided Conrail, the formerly government-owned railroad company, with Norfolk Southern in a 1997 merger.4. Norfolk Southern: $9.5bnOne of the most efficient railroads, Norfolk Southern has the smaller network of the two east-of-the-Mississippi Class Is but has routes more tightly focused on the main sources of traffic and has long generated better returns than its rivals. It is the most reliant of the Class Is on coal, handling coal produced in the Appalachians, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Much of it is exported through the company’s dedicated coal facility at Lamberts Point in Portsmouth, Virginia.5. Canadian National: $8.38bnCanadian National operates a substantial network in the US, as well as its core trans-continental line linking Vancouver and Calgary to the main eastern Canadian population centres.6. Canadian Pacific: $5.05bnCanadian Pacific, operating a network parallel to CN’s, is less profitable than its larger rival but gradually improving.7. Kansas City Southern: $1.81bnSmallest of the US and Canadian Class Is, Kansas City Southern markets itself as “the Nafta railroad”, since its main routes run north to south, linking Canada to Mexico. It also has extensive operations in Mexico and operates the Panama Canal Railway in Panama.
9;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2010-01-20T22:18:54Z;CSX boss warns on US rail legislation;;Investment in US freight railways will fall if proposed federal rail legislation is passed in its present form, the chief executive of the sector’s third-largest company has warned after announcing improved fourth-quarter net earnings.Michael Ward was speaking on Wednesday after CSX, the larger of two big railways in the eastern US, became the first major US-based rail company to announce 2009 results.CSX reported net earnings for the three months to December 25 up 23 per cent over the same quarter of 2008 to $305m on revenue down 13 per cent to $2.32bn. Full-year net earnings fell 16 per cent to $1.15bn on revenue down 20 per cent to $9.04bn.CSX had demonstrated its operating capability by withstanding the worst economic recession of recent times and emerging stronger, Mr Ward said. However, he expressed concern about the potential effects of legislation being debated to strengthen the powers of the Surface Transportation Board, the industry’s regulator.The main railways have long been concerned that tightening regulation could reduce the incentives for large investments in improved infrastructure and rolling stock. Some railway customers – particularly those that have no choice of operator – have complained about steep price rises.CSX is due to make $1.7bn capital investment this year.“We are concerned about threatened federal regulations that will without doubt cut investment in freight rail systems,” Mr Ward said.The company would comply with new federal regulations on rail signalling – expected to cost CSX $750m by 2015.But Mr Ward went on: “At the same time, we see other substantial federal demands on the horizon which could negatively impact the financial health of the industry. The current Senate version of the STB re-authorisation bill is not balanced.”Fuel – one of CSX’s largest outgoings – cost $250m in 2009, down 24 per cent on the year before. However, revenue from fuel surcharges also fell. Revenues and profitability were also hit by a 24 per cent fall in revenues from coal, the single biggest commodity for most freight railways and one of the most profitable cargoes.
11;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;US rail companies steam through the downturn in profit;;North America’s principal rail companies underlined their growing resilience and pricing power by reporting improved operating profits for the quarter when the economic downturn started in earnest.Over the past three weeks, the four biggest US-based operators – Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX and Norfolk Southern – all reported improved operating profits for the quarter compared with 2007, in spite of sharp volume falls in some commodities.Anthony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst, said the last quarter’s figures showed the companies had continued to enjoy the power to maintain prices they developed in the years of strong growth between 2003 and 2007.In the past, railroads were often forced to slash their rates during a recession to win traffic from trucking companies and keep the cash flow necessary to service their debts.“In the fourth quarter, we went from a slowdown to a complete collapse in demand,” Mr Hatch said. “Railroads responded with a good quarter. It’s further evidence that the rail renaissance, as I call it, is actually happening.”Railroads’ finances have improved as growing traffic levels have filled up the available capacity of their networks. For many, that has raised the returns on investments in new capacity above the cost of the capital required for the first time in more than 60 years.Even in areas where demand fell in the fourth quarter, revenue generally fell less than traffic. BNSF, which with Union Pacific dominates rail traffic in the western two-thirds of the US, saw volumes of automotive traffic – mainly new cars – fall 28.6 per cent between the last quarters of 2007 and 2008. But revenue per unit moved rose 20 per cent. Similarly, international inter-modal traffic – shipping containers moving between ports and end-customers – fell 11 per cent but revenue per unit moved rose 5.9 per cent.The companies’ pricing power was still more evident in the areas where demand remained strong. Norfolk Southern, which depends on coal mined in West Virginia and Pennsylvania for about a quarter of its revenues, benefited both from steady domestic demand for power station coal and continuing export demand. Coal volumes in the fourth quarter were up 5 per cent on the previous year, while revenues rose 33 per cent to $798m.However, according to Mr Hatch, demand for railroads to move containers within North America could be a still more positive long-term sign. Many observers had believed growth in recent years in the segment was dependent on high fuel prices, which made it cheaper for trucking lines to send goods by train for most of their trips.The only slight falls in volumes in the fourth quarter, when fuel prices fell substantially, suggest that instead a long-term shift of such traffic from road to rail is under way.
12;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2008-06-13T21:49:58Z;Numbers surge at elite pre-preps;;The number of very young children at private pre-prep schools has soared over the past decade, reflecting parents’ drive to give their offspring an educational edge as early in life as possible.The tally of under-four- year-olds at private schools has increased more than 20 per cent since 1998, as schools have responded to parental demand by opening pre-preps in idyllic rustic locations.Many of London’s top-performing institutions have opened or acquired pre-preps over the past decade, including King’s College School, Wimbledon, and Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ School.David Hanson, chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS), said private schools were responding to client demand by educating children at younger ages, since parents were keen on sending their child to the same school for as long as possible. “Where there is a good school, parents want to get the most out of the brand that they can,” he said.Preps are private institutions that educate children from about the age of seven to 13. Most of them now own or are affiliated with pre-prep schools, which educate very young children – often as early as two.Peter Hamilton, headmaster of Haberdashers’ Boys, “absolutely” expected most five-year-olds starting at its Kingfishers pre-prep to stay at the school “to 2021”, when they reach 18.KCS Wimbledon starts even earlier. Children can begin classes at The Rowans, acquired by KCS in 2002, as early as the age of two – although the school retains educational autonomy, and gives Rowans children no special preference for entry. Fees are £1,250 a term for the youngest at The Rowans. This compares with £4,115 for seven-year-olds at King’s College Junior School, and £5,150 for the senior school.The Good Schools Guide said: “The schools want to entice the parents and children in as young as possible, so that there is a home-grown supply of pupils for classes higher up the institution. Often the nursery fees are quite low, which attracts parents who might balk at the full fee for a seven- or eight-year-old.”The number of under-fours at institutions belonging to the Independent Schools Council – Britain’s main private school body, which includes IAPS – has climbed 21 per cent since 1998 to 23,300, compared with a 7 per cent increase for prep and pre-prep school age children as a whole. The number under three has leapt 42 per cent to 8,415.Parents want to start their children on the private education ladder so early because they are worried about them falling behind their peers, say some heads.Elaine Forsyth, head of pre-prep at The Hawthorns School in Surrey, which takes children from two years of age, said: “Parents worry that if they leave it too late in the private sector their children are going to miss out.” Ms Forsyth added that parents were even anxious to make sure their children were up to speed prior to pre-prep. She said: “Sometimes they come to us and say, ‘What should I be doing with my child beforehand?’ I say, ‘Talk to them’.”Diane Gardiner, head of Brookham School, a pre-prep linked with Hampshire prep Highfield, and chair of the IAPS’s pre-prep advisory committee, said: “We are taking over a lot of what parents used to do,” including early reading and number work. Among mothers, “there’s an atmosphere of, ‘life’s so frenetic I can’t do that at home’ ” – though she acknowledged that a majority of the mothers did not have jobs. Brookham opened a nursery for two- to three-year-olds in January, responding to “parental request”.Gerard Silverlock, headmaster of KCS’s Junior School, said starting children very young at pre-prep “unquestionably boosts them intellectually”. The ability of pupils from The Rowans and Squirrels, another pre-prep bought by KCS in 2006, was “quite striking” when they were tested for entry at six or seven by KCS Junior. This includes their performance in a standard group test of emotional and intellectual intelligence involving piling copies of the Financial Times as high as they can.But John Baugh, headmaster of Oxford’s prestigious Dragon prep, which has a pre-prep starting at four, said there was “absolutely no evidence” that children were “more literate or numerate” if they began school early. Instead, “at the age of four I think social skills are terribly important, developing emotional literacy”.One mother who has sent her two young girls since the age of three to a pre-prep in Kent that has what she calls “high expectations”, said: “I’d prefer something a little less high-pressure.”
13;KSU;Kansas City Southern;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;Mergers signal the rise of an all-powerful seven;;A series of mergers during the 1980s and 1990s shaped the structure of North America’s Class I railroads – all those with annual revenue of more than $319.3m – leaving most regions with just two competing operators.BNSF and Union Pacific compete over the western two-thirds of the US, while CSX and Norfolk Southern operate almost exclusively east of the Mississippi. The two Canadian Class Is – Canadian National and Canadian Pacific – have parallel routes from British Columbia to Canada’s main population centres, and substantial US operations.The seventh and smallest Class I – Kansas City Southern – operates mainly in a north-south corridor from the Canadian border through the Midwest into Mexico, where it owns one of the country’s two largest railroads.One of the two competing operators in each region has a history of being stronger than the other, even if the recent surge in traffic is reviving all lines. Just as BNSF’s operating figures have long been better than UP’s, Norfolk Southern has generally had stronger figures than CSX.
