0;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2020-04-04T12:57:41Z;Smokers stock up on tobacco and nicotine products;Legal marijuana producers also report spike in demand during lockdown ;The respiratory pandemic sweeping the world has lit a fire under smokers, sending them rushing out to stockpile cigarettes, nicotine patches and gum to keep their cravings at bay.Sales of tobacco products in the UK rose by 9 per cent in the third week of March compared with the same period a year earlier, according to market research group Nielsen. The spike contrasts with a 1 per cent fall in the 12 months to March compared with the same period a year earlier, as health-conscious smokers quit or switched to reduced-risk products such as vaping devices and oral tobacco.Purchases of nicotine-replacement products increased by 5 per cent year-on-year, but soared by 54 per cent in the third week of March compared with the same period a year earlier, Nielsen said.“If you are a smoker, you are pretty addicted to this stuff and if you are worried you won’t be able to get it then you will stockpile,” said Adam Spielman, an analyst at Citi, explaining that tobacco companies had increased shipments to retailers in the US due to “pantry loading by consumers”.Deborah Arnott, chief executive at anti-tobacco group Action on Smoking and Health, said stockpiling had coincided with stop-smoking services receiving a growing number of calls.“Smokers are worried, understandably, about the growing evidence that smokers who get Covid-19 are more likely to get serious respiratory problems and need intensive care,” she said.Mr Spielman said fluctuations in cigarette sales, which still make up the vast majority of revenues for tobacco groups despite their aggressive marketing of vaping and other alternative products, were not likely to affect financial performance.“Cigarette sales have been in decline for decades, but these companies have succeeded in growing profits by increasing prices,” he said. “Tobacco companies will only have a problem when they cannot keep up high prices.”However he questioned the notion that people will buy nicotine products at any cost pointing to financial difficulties ahead for many consumers. “As unemployment increases, we expect to see a modest acceleration of the decline in sales,” he said. Nicotine is not the only recreational substance that people fear will be in short supply. Weedmaps, a US-based online marijuana vendor, has reported a surge in demand, with orders going up by more than 400 per cent than usual on some days.Travis Rexroad, Weedmaps director of communications, said demand for products that are smoked had fallen while those that are consumed had become more popular.“There may be some hesitation to smoke [them] given that Covid-19 is a respiratory illness,” he said.
1;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2019-04-03T16:21:48Z;US cigarette sales drop as smokers shift to vaping;Sharp decline in volumes signals Big Tobacco’s challenge in adapting to new habits;The number of cigarette packs sold in the US dropped sharply in March, intensifying Wall Street concerns that smokers are stubbing out Big Tobacco’s core product at an accelerating pace as they shift to vaping.Sales volumes fell 8.8 per cent from a year ago in the four weeks to March 23, according to Nielsen data cited by Morgan Stanley. While price increases partly offset the impact on revenues, the decline exceeded an 8 per cent rate fall reported in February and a 5.3 per cent decrease in 2018.The figures are the latest sign of the pressures facing companies such as British American Tobacco and the Marlboro-maker Altria. The industry is investing heavily in ecigarettes and heated products, but still relies on revenues from regular cigarettes to support cash flow and dividend payouts.That strategy could be challenged by the escalating scrutiny on ecigarettes. US health officials have made clear the devices could help wean smokers off tobacco, but are worried the products could be hooking a new generation on nicotine. Ecigarette companies have already been told to stop marketing flavoured vaping products in stores in the US.On Wednesday the US Food and Drug Administration said it was also investigating whether there was a link between vaping and seizures, after 35 reported cases of seizures following ecigarette use between 2010 and early 2019.The regulatory crackdown has done little to curb the popularity of ecigarettes. The Nielsen figures showed continued strong growth in sales of products from Juul Labs, the ecigarette company that was valued at $38bn in December when Altria took a 35 per cent stake.Juul, which has argued that its ecigarettes are more effective than nicotine patches and other products in persuading smokers to switch from cigarettes, cited the data as evidence it was succeeding in its mission.“These changes in the US tobacco market are a testament to the success of Juul products in switching adult smokers off combustible cigarettes,” said Kevin Burns, Juul chief executive.Juul’s sales lept 154 per cent year-on-year, while its market share advanced from 6.2 per cent to 6.6 per cent over the course of the month.The Nielsen figures follow a forecast from Altria this year that the long-term decline in cigarette volumes was gathering pace.Billy Gifford, Altria’s chief financial officer, said at a conference that the volume decline had accelerated last year “outside of the 3-to-4 per cent historical range”. The company now expected volumes to fall at an average annual rate of 4-5 per cent over the next five years “as adult smokers continue to explore alternative tobacco categories”.Nielsen’s data track sales in only a minority of the US stores that sell cigarettes and have in the past shown larger declines than were subsequently reported by tobacco companies. Even so, analysts said they were a meaningful signal of a step-change in cigarette sales.Research this year by Pamela Kaufman, a Morgan Stanley tobacco analyst, showed that the correlation between rising sales of Juul’s products and falling cigarette sales had become far clearer in recent months.In a note to clients this week, Ms Kaufman said the Nielsen data showed Altria’s volumes in the most recent period had fallen 9.7 per cent against the same four weeks a year earlier.
2;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2018-11-29T05:00:33Z;Donald Trump pledged to be tough on crime, yet cartel prosecutions have dramatically fallen;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.For years, cartel prosecutors investigating the financial markets and car parts industry have racked up billions of dollars in penalties and a long string of convictions.But as those long-running investigations have wound down, new criminal antitrust cases have been thin on the ground at the US Department of Justice, according to a Financial Times analysis.In fiscal year 2018, just 16 new cases were publicly filed, the FT’s Kadhim Shubber found. (The analysis did not include cases that may remain under seal.) It is the lowest number since 1972, putting criminal antitrust enforcement under Donald Trump at its lowest ebb since Richard Nixon was in office.Eric Meiring, a former acting chief of one of the antitrust division’s criminal units, called the figures “surprisingly low” but said the numbers were likely to rebound as new investigations kicked into gear. “It takes a while to build these things back up,” said Meiring, who is now a partner at Winston & Strawn. The justice department declined to comment.The backdrop to the remarkable slowdown is the chorus of criticism of antitrust enforcement by progressives, some commentators in the media and, increasingly, Democratic lawmakers who may have the power to do something about it before long.The justice department has not yet released its official count for the year. But as a point of comparison, the department filed 72 cases in the first year of the Obama presidency, and when George W Bush came into office, his administration brought 44 criminal antitrust prosecutions in the first year.You’d be remiss if you thought the potential bidding war for Nielsen is suffering from any of the afflictions that are testing the cable TV channel operators it rates.DD’s Javier Espinoza, Eric Platt and James Fontanella-Khan have confirmed with multiple sources that if anything, interest in Nielsen is only perking up. The latest private equity group exploring a run is Madison Dearborn, which last year hired John Lewis, the former global president of Nielsen, “to secure compelling investment opportunities” in the information services sector.This would certainly be a deal that makes sense for him.Lewis, who is a partner at Madison Dearborn, is to play a central role in structuring a potential bid for Nielsen, New York advisers who have worked on deals with the private equity group tell DD.The Chicago-based PE group is joining a crowded group of interested bidders, including the likes of Blackstone, Hellman & Friedman and Carlyle. It’s unclear whether Madison Dearborn has hired advisers and whether it would bid for all or part of the company (Nielsen operates two primary segments: one that measures media habits and another that tracks consumer purchases).Expect the auction process to take off early next year. Any agreed deal would rank among the largest since the financial crisis. The company has an enterprise value of almost $18bn. Analysts with AllianceBernstein say an LBO with a takeover premium could be had for about $21bn.And there’s one more rub. The company recently appointed a new chief executive, who joins from IBM and is to start next week. The AllianceBernstein analysts say David Kenny could have a “financial motivation” to get the deal done. His stock options and restricted stock units could be worth more than $15m if the company is sold.Add it to the list of leveraged buyouts to have an eye on, alongside mooted takeovers of Arconic and Symantec.Consumer product stalwarts have desperately been trying to figure out what products youthful Americans are obsessing over. Altria, the cigarette maker formerly known as Philip Morris, is unsurprisingly turning to the vaping market. The FT reported on Wednesday that the maker of Marlboro sticks was close to making an investment in Juul, the leader by far in the emerging ecigarette business. Juul was most recently valued at $16bn and its prominence has already made it as a cultural touchstone. The FT reported that Altria was investing with an eye to eventually taking control.The news of the talks comes at an interesting moment. The US regulator FDA has sought to crack down on underage vaping by limiting what ecigs can be purchased in convenience stores. At the same, the FDA is looking to restrict the sale of menthol cigarettes. Shares in Altria, whose enterprise value is above $100bn, have fallen by as much as a fifth since early November. Additionally, recent Nielsen data, showing a sharp drop in cigarette sales in recent weeks, have spooked the market.Hidden homes Secrecy has long been a top priority for many ultra-wealthy home buyers and sellers.

3;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2018-11-29T05:00:26Z;TV ratings group Nielsen attracts bid interest from Madison Dearborn;A buyout could net the incoming CEO millions of dollars for just a few months’ work;Madison Dearborn has joined the pack of buyout firms exploring a bid for all or part of Nielsen, setting the stage for a takeover battle that may reward the US market research company’s new boss with millions of dollars for just a few months’ work.The Chicago-based private equity group’s interest in Nielsen was confirmed by multiple people with knowledge of its thinking, and at least six of the largest buyout funds have recently hired advisers for potential bids.A successful buyout could trigger a multimillion-dollar payout to Nielsen’s recently appointed chief executive, David Kenny, who is to start in early December. Mr Kenny joins from IBM and has been promised stock options and restricted stock units that analysts with AllianceBernstein estimate are worth $15.4m if the company is taken over at a price equal to $35 a share.A buyout at that price would reflect a 31 per cent premium to the company’s stock price on September 12, when it said it would expand a strategic review to include the study of a potential sale of the entire company.Including Nielsen’s more than $8bn of net debt, the company’s current enterprise value is close to $18bn. A takeover of Nielsen at any kind of premium would rank among the largest buyouts since the financial crisis a decade ago.“The CEO’s compensation package includes plenty of financial motivation for him to be supportive of the sale of the company,” AllianceBernstein analyst Todd Juenger said. He called Mr Kenny a “true triple threat, an executive who has been successful running public companies, private companies and selling companies”.Madison Dearborn’s potential bid comes after it hired John Lewis, former global president at Nielsen, last year “to secure compelling investment opportunities in” the information services sector. Mr Lewis, a partner at Madison Dearborn, is to play a central role in structuring a potential bid for Nielsen, New York advisers who have worked on deals with the private equity group said.Despite that connection, the private equity group is set to face considerable competition for control of Nielsen. A number of buyout groups have expressed interest in acquiring the TV ratings provider.A group led by Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman — together with Singapore’s GIC and Canada’s CPPIB — is studying a potential bid for the company. Washington-based Carlyle is also exploring ways it can acquire the business, people familiar with its intentions said.It was unclear whether Madison Dearborn has officially hired advisers and whether it would bid for a part or the whole of Nielsen alone or as part of a consortium.The private equity group, which has raised an aggregate of roughly $23bn through seven funds since it was founded in the early nineties, declined to comment. Nielsen also declined to comment.Nielsen hired advisers to explore a full sale after it came under pressure from activist hedge fund investor Elliott Management, which is unsatisfied with the way the company has performed.The company is divided into two units, one producing data on media consumption including its famous TV ratings, and the other tracking purchases of consumer products.Nielsen’s business has suffered as consumer-focused companies — including big packaged food groups — have cut television advertising spending and research. Its shares have fallen nearly 30 per cent this year, including a 25 per cent drop on a single day in July when the company slashed its financial forecasts and warned sales for the year would decline.The deal talks come amid a renewed buyout boom, driven by private equity firms which have raised record sums in recent months.At the start of the year Blackstone bought a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ financial and risk division in a $17bn deal, one of the largest transactions since the financial crisis. Buyout firm Thoma Bravo has separately approached Symantec about a takeover, a deal that analysts have said could value the US cyber security group at more than $19bn.In Europe, Washington-based buyout group Carlyle bought Akzo Nobel’s speciality chemicals unit in a €10.1bn deal, including debt — the largest transaction in more than a decade in the continent.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan
4;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2018-10-09T09:43:04Z;Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman explore Nielsen bid;Private equity groups look at joint bid for US market research company ;A group of large institutional investors has clubbed together to explore a bid for Nielsen, amid pressure from an activist investor on the US market research company with an enterprise value of roughly $17bn, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Buyout funds Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman — alongside co-investors CPPIB from Canada and GIC from Singapore — are exploring the possibility of a bid for the TV ratings provider, which has recently hired bankers in New York to explore strategic options.Nielsen, which has a market capitalisation of roughly $10bn, has come under growing pressure from hedge fund Elliott to look at options, including going private and selling itself.In August, Elliott revealed a stake in the company, which has been trying to adapt to changing consumer behaviour, including watching programmes on mobile devices.Carlyle, the Washington-based buyout group, has also expressed an interest, Bloomberg has reported. All members of the potential investor group declined to comment. Nielsen also declined to comment. People with direct knowledge of the possible deal warned a bid by the group was still in the early stages and that a deal was not guaranteed. Nielsen has also explored a merger with Kantar, the market research arm of WPP, people familiar with the deal said.If the consortium bid was successful it would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts in a decade, echoing the private equity club deals of the years before the crash.A sale to the Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman-led consortium would return Nielsen to its previous owners. Private equity groups, including Blackstone and H&F alongside Carlyle, KKR and others, took the company private in 2006. In 2011 the group took Nielsen public with a total debt of more than $8bn. The consortium looking to buy Nielsen is not the only potential combined private equity deal under way. Blackstone, Carlyle, Onex and CPPIB have teamed together as they seek to buy aluminium products maker Arconic.Investors have become wary of such deals because they bind together groups with often different investment horizons or strategic visions for the companies they acquire. They are also typically loaded with debt, which can prove toxic if trading conditions deteriorate.Some of the worst leveraged buyouts in history were club deals, including TXU, which was bought by a consortium including TPG and KKR, and the recent bankruptcy of Toys R Us, acquired by a group that included Bain Capital and KKR.
5;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2016-12-20T17:17:32Z;Nielsen to buy Gracenote to help track digital consumers’ habits;Tribune Media will sell movie, TV and music data company in $560m deal;Nielsen has agreed to buy Gracenote, a media data company, from Tribune Media, as it looks to provide a fuller picture of how people consume movies, television and music.For Nielsen, the measurement company whose TV ratings underpin billions of dollars in advertising sales, the cash and debt deal, valued at $560m, will give it access to Gracenote’s data on more than 12m movie and television listings and 200m music tracks.Gracenote, whose clients include Apple and Tesla, specialises in content recognition technology that is capable of figuring out what people are watching or listening to.The acquisition will help Nielsen “provide clients with deeper analytics on consumer behaviour” and help advertisers target customers in real time, the company said.The deal comes as media owners have been critical of Nielsen, complaining that the 93-year-old company has not adapted quickly enough to changing viewer habits.Executives from groups such as Viacom and NBCUniversal have called for better measurement of media consumption, as more people use mobile phones, tablets and internet-connected TVs to watch content when and where they want.Nielsen has been working to update its television ratings through a “total audience” measure that will better capture viewing, no matter the screen or source — from online video sites such as Netflix and YouTube to broadcast and cable channels. Nielsen has distributed the new data to some clients and says it will complete the rollout of a new ratings metric by March 1.Tribune Media, one of the largest US television station owners, bought Gracenote from Sony for $170m in 2013. Tribune said earlier this year it was exploring moves such as selling or separating “select lines of business or assets” to unlock value.Tribune said it expected to receive about $500m in after-tax proceeds from the Gracenote sale, which it will use to pay off debt. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year.“We are pleased to be streamlining our company so that we can focus even more intently on seizing future opportunities for our local television and entertainment business,” said Peter Liguori, Tribune Media’s chief executive.Tribune Media shares jumped 3.7 per cent, while Nielsen shares fell 0.3 per cent in morning trading.
6;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2016-01-06T14:58:10Z;CES 2016: Nielsen calls for new audience measures;Push for common metrics from TV to smartphones and tablets follows criticism of current ratings;"The media industry must adopt a common measurement system for content that appears on television, smartphones and other devices to avoid confusing advertisers, according to Nielsen, the research company.The company’s audience ratings form the basis for most of the $78bn of television advertising sold in the US each year. It will launch a new measurement system this year that will include viewing on digital devices — as well as TV — following criticism from media companies such as Viacom that its current system does not accurately reflect audience size.Lynda Clarizio, Nielsen’s president of US media, told the Financial Times that the company intends to end the disparity in measurement and pointed to audience estimates for a recent NFL American football game that was streamed online on Yahoo.The technology group paid about $20m for the rights to screen the October game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars and said that the game attracted 15.2m unique visitors in the US. This figure appeared to compare favourably with NFL games aired on broadcast and cable television, which attract an average audience of about 19m.Toyota poaches Google exec

More news and analysis from FT reportersBut Ms Clarizio said the two metrics measured different things. TV ratings are measured by average audience per minute: when this metric was applied to the Yahoo NFL game, the audience dropped to about 1.6m.“Metrics are often misunderstood,” she said. “We need to create a common language for measuring viewing, whether it’s on television or some other device.”Nielsen published a “comparable metrics” report on Wednesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which measured video consumption on TV, smartphones and other devices for the year to August 2015. The average audience increased for smartphones but slipped for TV — particularly among so-called millennial viewers aged 18-34.Smartphones were used more frequently on average per week than TV. But in terms of hours spent watching, TV remains the most popular way to view content. “Television is an extremely powerful medium and will remain so for many years to come,” said Glenn Enoch, Nielsen’s senior vice-president of audience insights.More US households are watching TV using a connected device, such as an Apple TV or Roku set-top box. Nielsen found that 4.3bn minutes of smartphone video were viewed by adults in an average week between July and August in the US, which compares with 53bn minutes viewed using connected devices.The growth of connected devices such as Apple TV boxes presents a problem for cable channels, with a majority losing viewers in 2015.Nielsen audience data showed that 26 of the top 35 cable channels attracted lower average primetime audiences in 2015 compared with 2014.Lower audience ratings and fears about “ cord-cutting”, the cancellation of cable and satellite television subscriptions, hit US media shares in 2015 with the S&P 500 Media Index falling 5.7 per cent, far more than the broader market, which was flat for the year."
7;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2015-07-13T23:11:30Z;Nielsen to take digital ad ratings service to seven new markets;Asia and Latin America launches could lay groundwork for way to measure consumption across devices;Nielsen is extending its digital advertising ratings service to seven new markets in Asia and Latin America, in a move that could boost online ad spending and lay the groundwork for a system to measure media consumption across devices and platforms.The service, which tracks the performance and viewership of advertising spots across devices and digital platforms, will be able to measure markets that make up 95 per cent of global advertising spending by the end of this year, said Megan Clarken, a Nielsen executive who is involved in strategy for the company’s digital products.“As global companies want to spend in these countries, they can compare their results across the board,” she said, enabling them to measure the performance of digital campaigns across different online destinations and compare it against traditional television advertising. “Bringing the discipline and transparency of third-party measurement is important for supporting growth in digital spending. We have seen this in the US.”Jennifer Gardner, who directs North American media investments and partnerships at Unilever, the consumer goods group, said Nielsen’s digital ad ratings service “brings a more rigorous standard to our online campaigns and consistency in measurement”.People are spending more time consuming digital media but advertisers have been slow to shift spending from traditional outlets such as TV and radio, formats on which they better understand how to measure and value viewership.Nielsen and competitors such as ComScore are racing to create digital measurement metrics that they hope will become the industry’s standard currency for buying and selling online ads.In markets outside of China, Nielsen is partnering with Facebook to identify demographic information, such as age and gender, of online audiences.Nielsen will be introducing the service in Singapore, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Mexico, bringing its total reach to 16 markets. Earlier this year Nielsen launched the programme in China in partnership with Tencent, the internet conglomerate.The expansion is a first step towards bringing Nielsen’s “total audience” measurement to those countries, said Roberto Vazquez, Nielsen’s head of watch and marketing effectiveness in Latin America.He added that advertisers who use digital ad ratings in the US have been asking Nielsen to extend the programme to Mexico so they can compare spending. Internet publishers will also benefit from the service because it will help them show the effectiveness of the ads they run and potentially raise prices as a result.“Internet penetration in Mexico is roughly 55 per cent. Today the online ad spending market is around $700m dollars yearly,” Mr Vazquez said. “It’s an opportunity to give the advertisers and the publishers a currency which will let them understand the importance of the online reach and give them some clarity, to start understanding the audience wherever they are, on whatever device they are using.”shannon.bond@ft.com@shannonpareil
8;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2015-03-31T23:05:33Z;Viewers seize control as digital video proliferates;Nielsen survey highlights challenge facing media companies and brands;A flourishing landscape of digital video services is giving consumers more power over what programming they watch and when — and they are seizing control, according to a new survey of global viewing habits by Nielsen.Sixty-four per cent of respondents told the US-based consumer researcher that “time-shifting” programming better suits their schedules. The same proportion said they often catch up on their favourite television shows by bingeing on several episodes in the same day. Yet 65 per cent said they prefer to watch shows at the specific time when they air.That constellation of responses might seem contradictory, but it suggests the scales are tipping towards broader consumer choice as media companies, pay-TV providers and technology groups roll out new ways for viewers to watch live and on-demand video content.Apple, HBO, Sony and Starz are among the companies leading a wave of internet services that are challenging the traditional ecosystem of pricey cable or satellite bundles.“For a long time we’ve been talking about people consuming content at the time they want, at the place they want. That’s been a dream over the past year that technology has made possible, and consumers have grabbed hold,” said Megan Clarken, Nielsen executive vice-president.Nielsen’s survey of 30,000 people in 60 countries highlights the challenges media owners and brands face in vying for consumers’ attention, even as those consumers are more connected than ever.For a long time we’ve been talking about people consuming content at the time they want, at the place they want. That’s been a dream over the past year that technology has made possibleSocial media is a driver of viewing, with more than half of respondents saying they like to keep up with shows so they can join in online discussions. Forty-seven per cent said they use social media while watching videos.That “second-screen” activity was higher in Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Middle East, where growing populations of middle class consumers are gaining access to mobile devices and broadband connections.Globally, more than half of those surveyed said they found it convenient to watch video on their mobile devices. But TV sets remained the most popular device for watching most kind of programmes, with the exception of short-form video, which was more popular on PCs, mobile phones and tablets.“The multiscreen experience shows the need [for media groups] to understand that consumers treat their screens differently. This is a fragmented world in which consumers will pick up these devices whenever, and they’re looking for different experiences from one device to another,” Ms Clarken said.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
9;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2015-01-04T17:52:01Z;TV Advertising: Very mad men;When TV ratings look bad, just claim they are wrong;"Kill the messenger. That might be an extreme reaction for America’s television networks, who have a grievance with Nielsen, the ratings data provider. For television, 2014 was a disappointing year in terms of ratings. That is problematic because the rating dive led to a fall in ad revenue across the sector.At the same time, clients are moving their ad spending towards digital (which is growing at a double-digit rate). So broadcasters are also moving online, eager to distribute their shows on phones, tablets, and laptops. But Nielsen’s ratings have not quite caught up to the “TV everywhere” phenomenon. So content owners will fight a two-front battle in 2015: prove that TV ratings, spread across all devices, are better than Nielsen says; and convince marketers that Nielsen data does not matter much anyway.Collectively in the third quarter, ad revenues for broadcast networks (NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox) fell 0.3 per cent, while they dropped 0.7 per cent for the group of eight cable network owners such as Time Warner and 21st Century Fox, according to MoffettNathanson. Viacom, whose cable networks include Nickelodeon and MTV, has been outspoken in pointing out that Nielsen only captures viewing on traditional TV, tablets, or phones when viewed within a seven-day window where the original ads remain unaltered. The system misses those who watch several episodes weeks later, or watch through services such as Apple or Amazon.Nielsen is working on ways to measure viewership comprehensively. Netflix has said it does not care about ratings since it relies on subscriptions for revenue. Viacom, regardless, says it wants its proportion of ad revenue that is non-Nielsen-based to rise from one-third now to a half in a few years. One way to do that is to grow so-called “dynamic ad insertion” where spots are customised for viewers.E-marketer predicts that digital ad revenue will pass television spend by 2018 (at $80bn). Networks will have to be tough and creative to get their piece.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
10;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2014-02-28T04:22:32Z;China falls out of love with cash;;China is rapidly ditching the centuries-old habit of paying its bills with trunkloads of cash, and making the shift to virtual forms of payment faster than any other country on earth.Figures released by the People’s Bank of China show a sharp rise in the popularity of anything other than cash – from debit cards to credit cards to electronic wallet mobile apps. China has a staggering 4.2bn bank cards in circulation, enough for every mainlander to have at least three.Ten times more of them are debit cards than credit cards (3.8bn compared with 391m), but credit card issuance also rose by 19 per cent in 2013, and Euromonitor predicts credit card usage will grow faster than that of other cards over the next five years. Overdue credit card debt – unpaid after six months – also leapt 72 per cent, but this is hardly US-style household debt: China’s overdue credit card debt is a mere 1.37 per cent of total credit outstanding.The shift away from cash is remarkable for a country which was the first to print paper money a millennium ago: until recently, cash was so popular in China that even large purchases like cars or houses were paid for with bundles of banknotes bearing the portrait of Mao Zedong.Very low rates of street crime make China, paradoxically, one of the safest countries for carrying around large wads of cash. And decades of deprivation coupled with an only rudimentary social safety net have left older Chinese with an almost pathological fear of debt – and a fondness for holding their wealth in their hands.But despite all that, MasterCard found in a recent global study that China is making the shift “from cash to cashless” far more rapidly than any other country surveyed, largely as a result of rapid urbanisation and government policies designed to encourage non-cash payments.Customers in China buy almost anything online – including fresh vegetablesAnd urban, affluent, internet-savvy Chinese consumers are even more wild about plastic. A recent Nielsen survey found that 71 per cent of shoppers in China’s top tier cities said they preferred bank cards over cash, compared with an average of half for other countries surveyed.Zhang Yujia is at the forefront of the shift from paper to plastic. In fact, she is something of a credit card evangelist, having converted her reluctant parents to the use of a low-limit card that they initially did not want.When it comes to the ways in which people pay for stuff, perhaps no country is as simultaneously futuristic and traditional as China’s neighbour, Japan. The country that first popularised mobile “e-wallets” is far from cashless: many restaurants won’t let you settle your bill with a credit card, let alone by swiping your phone across a screen . . .And she doesn’t stop at cards: over the recent lunar new year, she used Tencent’s social messaging platform WeChat to send traditional red envelopes full of virtual cash to her friends. Tencent says some 8m people sent Rmb400m ($65m) in electronic “hongbao” over the week-long holiday which ended in mid-February.Mobile payment apps are surging in popularity as an easy way to pay for smaller items such as taxi rides and movie tickets. When dining with friends who want to “go Dutch”, Ms Zhang pulls out her electronic wallet app from Alibaba’s Alipay to transfer her share of the bill to the friend sitting next to her.“Paper money stinks”, she says. Jason Chu, a Shanghai academic whose online alias is Big Bachelor, says he only carries Rmb100 with him at any one time: cash can be counterfeit and “carries bacteria and viruses”.Wu Weiyi of AlixPartners in Shanghai, an advisory firm, says it’s not just about convenience or even the extra cash flow that comes with buying goods now that are only paid for later: companies issue cards to staff to control and monitor their cash flow.But with many people signing up for cards to get the promotional gifts offered by banks, the number of active cards is much smaller than the total outstanding, he says. And in lower tier cities or among the less affluent, cash is still very popular: “Cash is more cost effective, vendors don’t have to pay fees for it, it can’t be so easily tracked and people use cash to avoid paying taxes.”The meteoric rise of online retail in China is also a big factor, says Saurabh Sharma of Ogilvy & Mather in Beijing. “Credit card adoption has taken off in the past two to three years primarily due to the explosive growth in online retail,” he says, noting “customers in China buy almost anything online – including fresh vegetables”.Zhang Yujia’s parents were tough converts to the credo of the credit card: “They weren’t accustomed to the concept of spending your money in the future,” she says.But now she’s got them buying everything from milk to soy sauce and newspapers with plastic. “They use their credit card as much as I do,” she says. These days, it seems, everyone in China is rapidly being weaned off their wallets.Additional reporting by Zhang Yan
11;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2013-05-06T16:56:12Z;Nielsen sells exhibition unit in $950m deal;;Nielsen, the media measurement and retail information group, has sold its last non-core business, offloading its exhibitions company in a $950m deal that indicates a revival in private equity interest in business-to-business media assets.Onex Corp, the Canadian private equity firm with about $15bn under management, is paying about 9.8 times the $97m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation that Nielsen Expositions reported last year, and more than five times its revenues, which rose 2 per cent to $183m last year.The Onex Partners III fund will contribute about $350m in cash to the deal, which gives it a portfolio of 65 US trade shows and conferences including the Imprinted Sportswear Shows and the Health + Fitness Business Expo.Face-to-face events have been less disrupted by digital innovation than other media businesses, but the industry’s economic sensitivity left several B2B media buyouts in trouble after the last wave of private equity deals in 2006 and 2007.Companies from Emap in the UK to Penton Media in the US struggled with the debt they took on before credit markets turned sour.A revival in private equity interest could encourage further transactions in the exhibitions industry. In 2011, Daily Mail and General Trust sold its US exhibitions arm, George Little Management, to Providence Equity Partners for $173m.Onex managing director Kosty Gillis expressed confidence in Nielsen Expositions’ high renewal rates, its longstanding relationships with exhibitors and the strength of its shows’ brands, indicating that Onex planned “continued expansion of its existing shows as well as select acquisitions.”The tax-free sale, in which Nielsen was advised by Credit Suisse, allows the group formerly known as VNU to focus on its “Watch” and “Buy” units, which measure television audiences and track consumers’ shopping habits. Nielsen sold Nielsen Business Media magazines, such as The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard, in 2009.Brian West, Nielsen’s chief financial officer, told analysts the disposal would also provide about $925m in net proceeds to offset the cost of its planned $1.3bn acquisition of Arbitron, the radio measurement company, lowering the amount of debt it will need to raise.“More importantly, it also increases our flexibility to return cash to shareholders over time,” he said.Analysts at Deutsche Bank estimated that the sale would enable Nielsen to keep its leverage to 3.75 times ebitda this year, having earlier expected that the Arbitron deal would increase debt from 3.45 times to 3.85 times ebitda.
12;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2012-12-18T22:06:22Z;Nielsen to buy radio measurement firm;;Nielsen, the global media measurement company, is acquiring Arbitron, the leading radio measurement firm, in a $1.3bn cash deal that expands Nielsen’s consumer tracking empire to include consumer listening habits.Company executives pitched the deal as a boon for both television and radio networks, which pay for the ratings data, as well as the media’s respective advertisers. A combined Nielsen-Arbitron would provide a richer picture of the five hours of television programming people on average watch a day, the two hours of radio they listen to, the websites they visit and the products they buy. That would allow media companies and marketers to better understand how advertising across media types influences people’s purchases.“This advances all the long-term objectives of our company because we capture more of the consumers’ time,” said David Calhoun, chief executive of Nielsen. “We have a broader measurement of what is rapidly changing consumer behaviour. The ROI point of view is what all of our clients want. They spend money to advertise. They spend money to advertise across mediums.”The deal also creates an opportunity for Arbitron to expand its reach globally.Combined, Nielsen and Arbitron generated total revenues of $6bn and adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortisation of $1.7bn in the 12 months ended September 30. Nielsen expects cost savings of at least $20m.The purchase price of $48 per share represents a 26 per cent premium over Arbitron’s closing price on Monday. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and antitrust scrutiny. Nielsen has a virtual monopoly on the TV ratings market in the US, while Arbitron has a similarly dominant position for radio ratings there.Some analysts, however, questioned the logic of the deal, which comes amid growing frustration from the television industry about Nielsen’s ability to accurately measure how people watch video across a range of devices, from the television set to a tablet.“Seems to us like a ‘zig’ when their customers were asking for a ‘zag’,” said Todd Juenger, an analyst with Bernstein Research. “It’s very hard to integrate two companies’ operations, especially while simultaneously reinventing one of the company’s operations.”Nielsen said that it continues to invest in new techniques for measuring online video consumption and that radio and audio streaming are a growing business.Radio executives, who are trying to convince marketers that their business is hip and not a stodgy old medium, applauded the news. “We hope this combination will elevate the awareness among marketers of the real value and power of radio. If so, this is a very good thing for radio,” said Bob Pittman, chief executive of Clear Channel Communications, the radio, digital and outdoor company.The two companies unsuccessfully attempted to work together in the past. In 2006, Nielsen and Arbitron created Project Apollo to build a “single source” research service that included media consumption and product purchasing data to help companies determine what makes people buy certain products. While some major advertisers signed on at launch, the company did not secure sufficient commitments and shut down the joint venture in 2008.Mr Calhoun said the notion of the venture was flawed but that new technologies coupled with the rise of big data should help the combined companies successfully tackle the issue today.“The technology that has developed over these years and the platforms that we enjoy allow us to solve for it differently,” he said. “But the need was always there. It is still there and we’re excited at the prospects.”
13;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2012-12-17T23:34:32Z;Twitter and Nielsen devise TV ratings;;Twitter is linking with media measurement company Nielsen to create a television ratings system based on the chatter that TV shows spark on the microblogging site.Called the Nielsen Twitter TV Rating, the new system will help media companies and marketers determine the commercial value of a television show by calculating the total number of people who tweet about a programme as well as the number of people who see those messages.Television shows that ignite more conversations on social media, in theory, would be deemed more valuable to advertisers because the viewers are considered more engaged with the programme.The deal represents an attempt by Nielsen to keep pace with the rapidly changing media landscape amid growing scrutiny over its ability to accurately measure how people consume television programmes across a range of devices, from the TV set to a tablet. For Twitter, the multiyear deal represents its latest effort to cosy up to the television industry and the $65bn in advertising spending it commands each year.“This is a big step forward to better understanding the volume and impact of commentary around TV programmes,” said Steve Hasker, president of global media products and advertiser solutions at Nielsen.The companies declined to provide financial details about the arrangement.For the past several years, marketers have tapped social media data to help them better gauge the commercial value of a television programme and identify shows generating “buzz”. For example, musical comedy drama Glee last spring catapulted from 74th place in Nielsen rankings to the second-ranked programme in a ratings system created by Publicis’s Optimedia that analyses information from Facebook, Twitter and range of other sources.“Social data help find a diamond in the rough,” said Rob Norman, chief digital officer at WPP’s GroupM media buying arm. “The question, from an advertisers’ point of view, is how do you attach yourself to the social stream of conversations?”Twitter executives have taken a more collaborative stance in dealing with TV than some in Silicon Valley who see the handsome advertising budgets allocated to TV as a source of their own future revenues.Chloe Sladden, Twitter’s vice-president of media, said in a statement that the company would be “collaborating with Twitter ecosystem partners on this metric to help broadcasters and advertisers create truly social TV experiences”, for instance enabling producers to integrate tweets or trends directly into their shows or making it easier for advertisers to buy “promoted tweets” when people click on hashtags or search for phrases prompted by the one-screen action.The deal also highlights the importance of live events to Twitter. After experimenting this year with dedicated pages of handpicked tweets about Nascar races and the London Olympics, with mixed results, live events are expected to see more focus at Twitter in 2013.A recent study by Deloitte found that the most popular shows on Twitter tend to be soap operas, talent contests and news. While a UK poll found that 30 per cent of people regularly use Facebook or Twitter while watching TV, only a “tiny” portion of the audience posts tweets about the show.“Twitter is backing vocals not lead vocals – TV is the ‘alpha screen’,” said Paul Lee, head of technology, media and telecoms research at Deloitte.
14;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2012-08-20T06:01:24Z;Iglo feels chilly winds across Europe;;Iglo Group was losing market share in the first half of the year in continental Europe, at the same time as owner Permira’s abortive attempt to sell the frozen fish finger maker fell apart, results released on Monday show.Iglo’s underlying sales were broadly flat on a like-for-like basis, although currency fluctuations and extra trading days boosted reported group net revenues 3.5 per cent year-on-year.Martin Glenn, chief executive, said Iglo had ceded share to private label manufacturers in Italy, where it bought Unilever’s frozen food operations in 2010.Iglo also lost out in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium where cash-strapped shoppers are increasingly turning to discount stores, where Iglo’s frozen fish, vegetables and ready meals are less widely available.In the UK, which accounts for one-third of Iglo’s sales, the company increased its market share. Frozen foods are also growing at a faster rate in the UK than other foodstuffs. According to Nielsen data, total UK supermarket sales increased 2.9 per cent, while the overall £4.5bn supermarket sales of frozen food are growing at 3.1 per cent.Frozen food has been a beneficiary of the austerity era. It is generally cheaper than chilled or fresh food, and entails less waste – a key concern for households striving to eke out dwindling budgets.Mike Watkins, head of retail and business insight at Nielsen, a global information and measurement company, pointed to the move by Tesco, the UK’s biggest retailer, to extend its doubling of Clubcard points for spending to frozen foods, as evidence of the importance now being given to the category.“With frozen food you don’t waste it, it’s value for money, and there are some good brands as well as strong private label. So it ticks all these consumer boxes,” he said.Iglo saw earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rise 12.8 per cent to €180.3m in the first six months of the year. Mr Glenn said the company had invested record amounts of capital expenditure in absolute terms and also increased advertising.However, he sounded a cautious note on the outlook with a continuing “steady squeeze” on households’ disposable income. “Looking forward we are assuming the retail environment is going to remain tough and get tougher in Europe,” he said.Last month Permira, the private equity firm, dropped plans for a €500m refinancing of Iglo that had been designed to return the majority of the capital to investors.That followed the collapse of sale talks with rival investors including Blackstone and BC Partners. Buyers were looking at rolling up other assets in the frozen food sector.The sale was expected to raise about €2.5bn but offers fell short. Permira puts the company’s enterprise value at between €2.8bn and €3bn.
15;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2012-05-25T21:25:19Z;Dish;The TV distribution industry has a dilemma: its customers dislike ads but its suppliers depend on them;All Americans are in Dish’s debt. The satellite TV distributor has solved the great challenge of modern life: that of dragging your fat, greasy hand out of the bag of crisps, picking up the remote for the digital video recorder, and fast forwarding through the ads. Free at last!Dish’s “Hopper” set-top box automatically records the entire primetime line-up each night and saves it for viewing later, advertisements removed. Three of the companies that produce that programming (News Corp, Comcast, and CBS) have greeted this breakthrough with a lawsuit, alleging that it amounts to an unauthorised video-on-demand service pushing stolen programming. This could undermine the “quality of primetime programming” by undercutting the advertising revenues that support it.Advertising is crucially important to TV. PwC estimates that in 2011 46 per cent of TV revenues came from advertising, as opposed to fees and subscriptions. At Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, the proportion is more than half, due to its strong presence in broadcast TV. Plenty of consumers use DVRs already, but only about an eighth of primetime programming is watched on delay, though that is growing, according to Nielsen data. So making delayed (and adless) viewing easier is a direct threat to the content producers’ business models.The lawsuit, in the long run, matters less than how the TV distribution industry decides to manage a fundamental tension. Its customers do not like ads. Its suppliers depend on them. Of course, the simplest way to resolve the tension would be delivering adless TV, charging more for it, and passing the added revenues back to the programmers. But what if consumers, confronted with the real cost of television, decide it is not worth the money?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
16;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2012-03-26T05:03:01Z;Tetra Pak works on smart milk cartons;;Milk cartons that change colour when left out of the fridge too long are to go on sale courtesy of Tetra Pak, the world’s biggest packaging company.Smart cartons are an example of growing innovation in the $400bn packaging industry, which has been forced to reinvent itself alongside the consumer sector it serves.Makers of packaging are big spenders on research and development: Tetra Pak has patents on 5,500 packets and spends 4 per cent of sales on R&D. That compares with the 2-3 per cent spent by manufacturers of the food and personal care goods in these packages.Companies are using less material to cut costs, meet sustainability criteria and serve new markets. In the Gulf demand for packaged liquid food has doubled in six years.“Resources are becoming scarcer and, with costs being higher, it is important to …do more with less,” said Dennis Jönsson, Tetra Pak chief executive.The privately held group, which on Monday will unveil a 5 per cent rise in turnover to €10.36bn, is working on a chip that can be embedded in packages to provide information – such as how long a carton has been outside the fridge – on a scannable label. Mr Jönsson said cartons using the chips would be on the shelves next year.Working with Aurora, a Brazilian food co-operative, Tetra Pak has devised a code that, when scanned with a mobile phone, can indicate which cow on which farm produced the milk, and other processing and packaging information.Mr Jönsson said the Bric countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China were the most concerned about sustainability, especially climate-conscious Brazil.In a recent Nielsen survey about 90 per cent of Latin American respondents fretted about climate change and said their shopping habits were influenced by the use of raw materials that are harmful to the environment.These concerns have prompted Tetra Pak, together with Nestlé Brazil, to launch two milk brands in aseptic cartons with caps made from green polyethylene, which uses sustainable resources and reduces carbon dioxide emissions.
17;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2012-01-20T14:35:16Z;Sport remains king for America’s TV networks;;When Alex Smith and the San Francisco 49ers take the field against Eli Manning and the New York Giants this Sunday with a place in the Super Bowl at stake, a record number of US viewers are expected to tune in to the National Football League’s NFC championship game in yet another demonstration of the power of live sports programming.All season long the NFL has delivered strong television ratings, driven by the ever-growing popularity of American football and a series of compelling storylines. During last weekend’s divisional play-off games, an average of 36.6m viewers watched each game, up four per cent from last year, according to data company Nielsen. The record was 52m viewers for last years NFC championship game between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay PackersThose numbers have proved a boon for the networks carrying the games, giving them strong ratings data they can use to boost premium ad sales. “CBS and Fox both benefited from the NFL playoffs,” said Macquarie Capital analyst Tim Nollen.The continued strength of the NFL allowed it to secure deals worth $24bn in December, when it signed 10-year agreements with its three main broadcast partners, CBS, Comcast’s NBC, and News Corp’s Fox.Though pricey, the games were seen as must-have content for the broadcast networks. Live sports, and football in particular, “is the way to keep people watching their channels and prevent potential cord cutting”, said Mr Nollen.With more entertainment options than ever before, sports has proven the rare cultural unifier. “There has been so much media fragmentation going on over the last several years, pro football is still something that brings people together,” said Raymond Taylor, marketing professor at the Villanova School of Business.And the NFL is wrapping up one of its most unusual seasons ever. After a divisive labour dispute put the season in jeopardy, it ultimately began as scheduled. Then a lock-out at the National Basketball Association for the last three months of 2011 made football essentially the only game in town for US sports fans. “Those events helped galvanize fans’ support for football,” Mr Nollen said.Other factors in the NFL’s ratings success this season included record-breaking offensive performances, and the spirited discussion around Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow.Mr Tebow, who led his team to the play-offs, is controversial for his unorthodox style of play and his unabashed religious views – he celebrates good fortune on the field by dropping to one knee and lowering his head in prayer. His rising celebrity set off a national debate about the relationship between sports and faith.“There’s some level of controversy around him because some people think he’s overrated,” said Mr Taylor. “But a foundation of the US culture is the Judeo-Christian work ethic, and most Americans admire his values, even if they’re not that religious themselves.”Though Mr Tebow and the Broncos were eliminated from the play-offs, the Super Bowl on February 5 is expected to draw record ratings yet again. “It’s going to be the single most-watched TV event of the year in the US by a long way,” said Mr Nollen.Anticipation for the game pushed ad sales for the Super Bowl to an all time high. NBC has charged up to $4m for each 30 second spot during the game, a 17 per cent increase over the rates Fox charged last year.“The sport itself is very well suited to American culture,” said Mr Taylor. “It’s fast and very high-scoring, there are a lot of commercial breaks.”
18;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2011-11-18T19:00:50Z;Indian TV mogul hopes to channel US viewers;;Subhash Chandra, the Indian media pioneer behind the Zee TV channel, is making a $250m bet that he can get American viewers and advertisers interested in Indian-style alternative therapies and “wellness” programming.The investment will go towards original and acquired programmes for Veria Living, a US cable and satellite channel and website focused on yoga, holistic treatments and healthy eating, and represents the largest such investment by an Indian media group in content for the US market, he said.Mr Chandra, the Essel Group chairman who began his entertainment career more than 20 years ago with one Mumbai amusement park, is using his family’s money, rather than the budget of Zee TV, which is 51 per cent family-controlled. He launched the Veria channel in 2010 with a $100m investment.Part of the new funds will be used to rebrand the channel from Veria to Veria Living to help explain its positioning more clearly to US viewers.“This is the only health and wellness channel in the US,” said Mr Chandra, who practices Vipassana meditation. “This country [the US] produces about 25,000 masters degree holders every year in Ayurvedha [traditional Indian medicine]. They will get a voice, as will the tens of thousands of practitioners in the US.”Veria has had trouble persuading the largest US cable operators, including Comcast and Time Warner Cable, to carry the channel, however, which is now available through Dish, Verizon FiOS and Frontier Communications in just 10m of the 80m US TV homes. Mr Chandra said he hoped to be in 35m-40m US homes by the end of 2012.“Big cable companies were not as receptive as we would have expected,” Mr Chandra said, but Veria was now talking to “all the big cable operators” and to newer digital distributors. Online channels, from YouTube to Hulu, have begun to provide a more viable home for specialist programming, from cricket games for Americans of Indian extraction to documentary films that struggle to get cable distribution.Extra distribution will be critical for Veria to get the Nielsen ratings advertisers demand and to reach Mr Chandra’s goal of the channel breaking even within 24 months.Mr Chandra’s bet on the US market comes at a time when growth in Indian cable TV has slowed. Although no longer growing at 30-35 per cent per year, at 14-15 per cent it still exceeds the growth in US pay-TV and continues to attract investment from large US media groups. India has the world’s third-largest number of homes with pay television, at about 100m, serviced by more than 450 channels.Groups including Disney, NBC, Time Warner, and Viacom have committed several billion dollars to India’s entertainment industry over the past two years.Mr Chandra said the multitude of competitors in India’s television market were losing a combined $3bn a year, making Zee TV “one of a handful” of profitable operators.Margins across the Indian pay-TV market are among the lowest of any emerging market because of rising costs, competition and reliance on legacy analogue networks.These losses would force the industry to consolidate, Mr Chandra predicted, saying that this “cleaning up” would bring annual growth back to the 30-35 per cent rate within three to five years.KPMG India expects the number of TV households in Asia’s third-largest economy to exceed 156m by 2015. India is also expected to overtake China as the largest pay-TV advertising market in Asia by 2017 with $5.6bn in net revenues, according to Media Partners Asia.
19;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2011-11-10T18:30:49Z;‘Transformers’ success boosts Viacom;US media group expands share buy-back plan from $4bn to $10bn;Viacom has become the latest large US media group to step up share buy-backs, after the box office success of the latest Transformers film helped to power a one-third rise in adjusted fourth quarter net earnings to $614m.The owner of Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures said it would expand its share repurchases from $4bn to $10bn, after its earnings were also boosted by rising cable television revenues.The company plans to use both free cash flow and additional borrowings to spend the $7.2bn it has left in the buy-back programme over the next two years.The $2.5bn Viacom spent on its own stock in the past year echoes similar moves from rivals including Time Warner and News Corp to step up shareholder returns. Viacom’s buy-backs helped to boost adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter by 41 per cent to $1.06, and for the full year by a quarter to $3.78.Transformers: Dark of the Moon was Paramount’s first film to gross more than $1bn around the world. It lifted revenues from Viacom’s historically volatile filmed entertainment division by 46 per cent to $1.79bn in the quarter and more than trebled the unit’s operating income, from $52m to $185m.The studio will release Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol in December, and has new Paranormal Activity, Transformers and Star Trek films in the pipeline.The larger media networks division, which houses Viacom’s cable channels, raised quarterly earnings 8 per cent to $2.29bn on 7 per cent growth in advertising revenues and an 11 per cent rise in affiliate fees thanks to rate increases from cable and satellite distributors. Media networks operating profits rose 10 per cent to $958m.The results benefit from the exclusion of last year’s costs of shedding the underperforming Harmonix video games division. Sumner Redstone, the 88-year-old chairman of Viacom and CBS, said they demonstrated that Viacom was “clearly on a roll”, hailing its chief executive, Philippe Dauman, as “certainly one of the wisest, most brilliant CEOs in the media industry”.Mr Dauman said its growth came from a “one-two punch of creative excellence and operational discipline”, highlighting recent restructuring moves at Paramount which resulted in a $135m charge in the quarter.He highlighted some challenges, however, saying that advertising sales growth faced “headwinds” despite pricing remaining strong, noting that reruns of old shows were struggling and pointing to ratings issues, including what he called an anomalous drop-off in audience figures for Nickelodeon, its children’s network.Viacom was in discussions over the “inexplicable” change with Nielsen and the Media Ratings Council, two ratings groups, Mr Dauman said, adding that independent set top box data showed “meaningfully different” trends.Shares in Viacom closed up 8.2 per cent, or $3.31, at $43.61.
20;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2011-10-24T22:40:05Z;A new kind of benevolence;;"A harried new mother reaches for a packet of nappies in Belgium and in Bangladesh a baby is vaccinated against tetanus; in San Francisco, a teenage boy swigs a bottle of fizzy drink and an Ethiopian chickpea farmer becomes a little bit richer.Consumer-facing multinationals, having banged the drum on corporate and social sustainability, are also turning their attention to a more tangible social issue: the world’s poor.An increasing number of initiatives have been designed to spark the interest of consumers, who have become increasingly apathetic and cynical about environmental claims, while keeping other stakeholders – particularly investors and employees – on side. A recent global study by Nielsen found that US consumers recorded one of the steepest declines in concern about global warming: less than half of Americans polled fret about climate change and only 58 per cent of Britons do.Thus, at last month’s Clinton Global Initiative– former US president Bill Clinton’s annual philanthropic summit, which attracts business executives, celebrities and heads of non-profit organisations – a slew of heart-warming deals were launched, ranging from efforts to restore sight to the blind to coaching young adults and eradicating disease.Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer goods company, has put the heft of its $9bn Pampers nappies brand behind a campaign, conducted with Unicef, to help protect 100m women and babies from tetanus. For each pack of nappies sold, Procter & Gamble will donate one tetanus vaccine.“Baby care consumers want a clear idea of the benefits,” says Matthew Price, an executive at Procter & Gamble who heads the Pampers-Unicef initiative. “This is an emotional story.”Emotional, but not purely altruistic. P&G says it recoups the 7 cents per vaccine it donates through increased sales because of the vaccine campaign marketing.Similar initiatives by companies in other sectors tick different commercial boxes: food and drink companies’ support of smallholders helps ensure security of supply; drugmakers Eli Lilly and Dow Chemical both have pledges to help educate the next generation of scientists.Derek Yach, senior vice-president for global health policy at PepsiCo, is clear that the US beverage and snack group’s project helping chickpea farmers in Ethiopia improve productivity fits firmly into the bigger corporate picture. The company, which has already established its agronomist credentials through potato farming in China and sunflower oil farming in Mexico, literally reaps what it sows: potatoes and oil in crisps, chickpeas in hummus and smoothies.“As a company, we felt we needed to start diversifying our supply chain, first in terms of where we source for our global business and look to where we could boost [production] without changing the environment,” he explains.The company also aims to lift communities out of poverty and turn subsistence farmers into entrepreneurs through the provision of superior seeds, training in modern farming methods and irrigation.Similar projects are being carried out across the globe by other companies. Nestlé, the world’s biggest food and drink company by sales, deals with more than 500m farmers who supply it with everything from crops to milk. SABMiller, which derives 80 per cent of sales from emerging markets, has 28,000 smallholders, 19,000 of which are in Africa, from whom it buys grains.Both organisations are providing farmers with training and specialist knowledge on how to improve crop yields which, in turn, helps the companies improve the quality of their products.Today’s corporate benefactors thus clearly have an eye on their own commercial concerns, as well as wider society. But this was not always the case.“Traditionally, these were done from a purely philanthropic perspective and in a somewhat haphazard way,” says Karina Litvack, head of governance and sustainable investment at UK-based F&C Investments.If charity begins at home, philanthropy often begins on the farm. Food and drink manufacturers are pouring resources into farmers, helping them procure superior quality seeds and teaching modern agricultural methods.The aim is two-pronged: improved yields for manufacturers and more money for farmers. Nestlé says that by replacing cocoa trees in Ivory Coast with varieties that produce three times more cocoa beans, a farmer’s annual income of $480 per hectare is likely to more than treble to $1,800 per hectare.This has led to the rise of a relatively new figure on corporate payrolls: the agronomist, teaching the benefits of modern farming.The role can, however, extend to helping procure equipment or liaising with banks to arrange better terms for loans.Thus PepsiCo, which works with 25,000 farmers globally, has 200 agronomists on its books. Nestlé employs 1,000 agronomists and SABMiller has 60.But an increasing number of companies, she says, are now carrying out extensive research and engaging in activities directly linked to their business. Ms Litvack cites as examples mining companies offering treatments for HIV to employees and staff.It is also a strategic decision that reflects a growing focus on fast- growing emerging markets. Companies hope that building loyalty and a reputation now will pay dividends when incomes rise and consumers in a country turn from recipients of aid to buyers of goods.It may be some time before Bangladeshi mothers are bulk-buying Pampers, but in Ethiopia – where gross domestic product, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, is expected to grow 7.75 per cent in 2011-2012 – consumers are a ready market for processed chickpeas.Indeed, says Mr Yach, in a country where the Ethiopian Orthodox Church prohibits the eating of certain meats and dairy products for up to 200 days a year, the market for alternative proteins is particularly attractive.However, doing good is not always easy. A report by Saïd Business School’s Linda Scott, Mary Johnstone-Louis and Catherine Dolan on the Pampers initiative lays bare an intricate administration and bickering over minutiae.Even after P&G acceded to a last-minute 40 per cent increase in the cost of the vaccine, there were further problems getting it to recipients, who were often in remote places and un­able to fund the long trek for a free jab.The use of celebrities by P&G caused another spat. P&G uses stars, such as actress Salma Hayek, to advertise its products, and liked taking them – along with top-ranking staff and press – to watch the vaccines being administered. According to the report, the celebrity focus “was unseemly, perhaps too commercial for Unicef . . . [whose field offices] sometimes grumbled that these press junkets were an unwelcome distraction”.Success also brought its own pitfalls. According to the report, gung-ho Procter & Gamble employees wanted to roll the campaign out to other products in the portfolio, where the link with babies was rather more tenuous, such as Ariel washing powder and Duracell batteries.Yet, despite such pitfalls, “everyone has benefited,” says Ms Scott. Procter & Gamble sold more nappies, gaining share even in mature markets and Unicef also built its brand. Tim Hunter, Unicef’s international fundraising director, says: “This is a great way of engaging with an audience, which Unicef would not be able to do itself because we don’t have the big ad agencies.”"

In recent decades, apprenticeships and workplace training have been gradually downgraded, to the extent that many manufacturers now complain they cannot find the skilled workers they need in spite of stubbornly high unemployment.Mechanics and engineers from the baby-boom generation – born in the two decades following the second world war – formed the backbone of the US’s industrial workforce from the 1960s onwards. However, the first baby boomers become eligible for retirement this year, raising the spectre that the skills gap could worsen sharply in the next few years.Some 55 per cent of industrial companies with annual revenues of at least $1bn expect skills shortages prompted by retirements to cost them at least $100m in the next five years, they said in a survey conducted for Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include companies such as Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron.Most of the costs will be accounted for by recruiting, training and overtime costs, said Jeff Owens, ATS chief executive. He said the costs also take into account the likelihood that equipment would not be operated for part of the time because of a lack of qualified maintenance staff. “You’re talking about falling productivity and a shorter life for fixed assets in factories,” Mr Owens said.Rick Stephens, senior vice-president of human resources at Boeing, the aircraft maker, said his company is well aware of the problem. “Like most aerospace companies, we have a workforce that is more on the mature side,” he said.Mr Stephens said Boeing spends about $80m annually in workforce training. “We’ve also significantly increased spending in the past year to train up new employees to ensure they’re qualified to go into the production environment,” he said.The problem of the looming retirement of highly experienced workers, Mr Stephens said, has been aggravated by the fact that new recruits tend to be far less technically skilled than entry-level workers were decades ago. In response, Boeing recently doubled its introductory training course from 6-7 weeks to 13 weeks.Mr Owens said the recession had enabled manufacturers to avoid facing the retirement issue. “Companies have put this problem off for a long time because it’s not been pressing,” he said. “But many companies are starting to discover how urgent it is when they look at the average age of their workforce.”The survey also found that 45 per cent of companies are encouraging older workers to delay their retirements as they face the prospect of losing skilled staff, while employees are keen to rebuild their recession-hit pension funds.“The folks that we expected to retire, the age has been extended a bit because of the economy’s effects on peoples’ savings and retirement plans,” said Mr Stephens.Mr Owens said that could help postpone the problem, but could not overcome it. He also noted that older skilled workers tend to be less productive.“Manufacturers have assumed they can simply hire people when they need them, but when they start to look, they realise how difficult it is to hire.” Half of the survey respondents said they had 11 or more open positions for skilled workers, with one-third having more than 20 unfilled vacancies.
22;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2011-09-01T11:45:19Z;India: skin whiteners for the masses;;"A dark skin complexion remains one of Indian society’s most visible taboos.Indians are becoming more western in their consumer habits, buying anything from jeans to mobile phones, but on one point they remain resolutely traditional – the preference for fair over dark skin.The skin-lightening industry is expanding. No longer the preserve of middle-income women who indulge in daily healthcare regimes, whitening is both widening its product range and target demographic, moving from faces to armpits, and from middle-class women to men and the rural poor respectively.Earlier this year, German giants Nivea launched the first spray-on whitening deodorant for female underarms for a specifically Indian market, whilst the likes of French company Garnier, Germany’s Beiersdorf, and India’s Emami are targeting the male grooming market with their own ranges of men-only whitening products.Meanwhile, in rural India, sales of skin whitening creams have grown by 100 per cent.“The key to success is in the bottom of the pyramid” according to Aditya Agarwal, director of the Emami Group, whose ‘Fair and Handsome’ cream is endorsed by India’s most famous actor, Shah Rukh Khan.“As we know, in the era of commodity explosion, the rural market has emerged as a lucrative target,” he told the Hindustan Times.The skin whitening industry as a whole is worth an estimated $466m and is expanding at a rate of 25 per cent a year according to the research firm Nielsen – growth that is both evidence of the rising purchasing power of socially mobile Indians and the availability of cheap skin-whitening products to poorer parts of the population.What is an age-old prejudice that links darker skin with lower castes, menial labour and a perception of being less beautiful by default, is now a multi-million dollar industry.“The smart approach of having smaller sachets that are priced right and media campaigns in rural areas have contributed to wide-spread use of whitening products in rural India” according to Lydia Durairaj from organisation Women of Worth, which launched a Dark is Beautiful campaign in 2009.“But even before, the market was inundated with whitening products. Other local bleaching or coloring agents were being used throughout the country. New products just highlight these practices as glamorous, trendy, and appealing” Durairaj told beyondbrics.The ubiquity of skin-whitening is partly based on the fact that it can be achieved without recourse to drastic or expensive cosmetic procedures. You don’t even have to be a user of the somewhat non-subtly named market leader, Unilever’s ‘Fair & Lovely’, to take measures to lighten your skin. Most moisturisers and lotions aimed at women contain lightening elements and in contrast to bleaching, boast time-honoured herbal ingredients.Periodic rows about the practice have often erupted, and usually around celebrity involvement, but they seem to have little effect on consumers. Fashion magazine Vogue India attempted to take a stand against the “appearance of light-skinned Bollywood stars and models” in an issue called Dawn of the Dusk that celebrated the “skin the world covets”.But is it right to expect Indians to rail against the practice, especially when the tanning industry in developed markets, notably the west, is so lucrative? One could argue that the desire for lighter skin in Asia is just the flip side of the popularity for bronzed and tanned complexions amongst Caucasians and Europeans, which may not have such ancient associations, but similary link darker complexions with health and attractiveness.For the companies that produce them at least, skin-whitening products provide for a social need however questionable this need is. When it comes to Snow White’s age old call of ‘ mirror, mirror on the wall’, it seems that for Indians, the lightest are still the fairest of them all.Related reading:

23;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2011-08-07T17:14:40Z;Nielsen to launch online campaign rating tool;;Nielsen, the audience measurement group, will next week roll out a new approach to measuring online display advertising across the US using Facebook data and TV-style reporting, after a trial that showed many supposedly targeted campaigns are missing their goals.Nielsen Online Campaign Ratings, tested on 80 campaigns on 15 publishers’ sites since March, will be made available to all US media buyers on August 15, giving advertisers daily reports on campaigns running on Facebook and the wider web in one place, using the “gross ratings points” data they use to track TV ads.The early trial results had been “astonishing”, said Steve Hasker, Nielsen’s president of media products and advertiser solutions, showing that just 30 per cent of branded display advertising aimed at specific age- and gender-defined demographic groups was hitting its target. By contrast, mass-market campaigns hit their target three times out of four.“We were pretty surprised that some sites did very well but some sites did incredibly poorly. [Advertisers] expect online to be 100 per cent accurate,” said Brad Smallwood, who runs Facebook’s measurement and insights team.“I think we’ll see something of a flight to quality,” Mr Hasker said, predicting “a sea-change” in advertisers’ approach to online media. “Sites with more targeted content, like NYTimes.com, FT.com, TV programmes’ websites, Facebook and others will do very well,” he argued.He declined to name sites which could lose out, but said those with less defined audiences could still attract campaigns targeted at a general audience but could struggle to convince marketers that they could reach sub-sectors of that audience.Mr Smallwood predicted that the new metric would encourage advertisers to divert some of their advertising buys in the costly last-minute “scatter” market to cheaper online outlets.The use of TV-style ratings would “get people comfortable” with online display advertising, but Facebook could “migrate away” to other metrics in time, he added.“The more we standardise the measures they’re buying, the more we get them confident that these things lead to actual [returns on investment], then the more money moves over [from older media],” Mr Smallwood said.The new ratings system combines data from Nielsen’s panels of TV viewers and online users with Facebook’s database of users, anonymised to provide just demographic data.Facebook currently provides the information exclusively to Nielsen, which plans to add other data providers. Comscore, which competes with Nielsen online but not in TV, has launched its own platform for measuring brands’ exposure in Facebook.Nielsen and rivals are competing to persuade advertisers that they can deliver improved insights into online advertising, and battling long-held frustrations among media agencies with the data they receive even for TV.Facebook has been working to move advertisers away from measuring its success purely in terms of clicks and fan numbers, announcing a new “client council” at the Cannes Lions advertising festival in June to guide its strategy.“Facebook have tremendous reach and great demographic data. Typically, people don’t lie about who they are on Facebook,” Mr Hasker said, adding that Nielsen hoped to expand the technology to track how users comment on or “like” pieces of marketing content on social media.It is also working to introduce Online Campaign Ratings to non-US markets, starting with the UK, and to smartphones and tablet computers.
24;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2011-03-15T16:22:30Z;Online advertising: It is hard to tell if the ads work;;As advertising dollars speed to the web, marketers are scrambling to find ways to measure the effectiveness of their search, display and social media efforts.While companies such as Nielsen and Omniture provide some ways of doing this, they give an incomplete picture of online behaviour.In addition to the “last click” (which records how a user came to a site, and if it was from an ad), the bigger question of how online advertising influences brand awareness is exceedingly hard to address.Measuring the effectiveness of online advertising is “very difficult,” says Tony Palmer, chief marketing officer of Kimberly-Clark, a consumer products group. Mr Palmer’s team has developed a strategy that is tailored to each product launch or new campaign.And yet, even years of internal development have not delivered an adequate solution. “We’re probably at 50 per cent of where we want to be in being able to measure our media mix,” he says. “It’s a competitive advantage to have better analytics.”In an effort to close this gap, new companies are emerging with the aim of providing more “holistic” measurement systems.MarketShare, which tries to measure how online spending works in concert with offline campaigns, has lured half the Fortune 50 as clients. Wes Nichols, its chief executive, says: “Rather than look at just who’s seeing something from outdoor, or online or in-store, we’re looking at how does it drive sales? How do they combine to create a reaction?”Mr Nichols cautions that it “is not as simple as looking at media mix”. Instead, he likens it to the human genome project. “It’s not like one gene causes cancer,” he says. “It’s a combination of factors.”For example, a consumer might see a Toyota ad on Yahoo, do a Google search for Toyota later and then go to Edmunds.com, the car guide, to look at ratings.“There are a lot of things that impacted what got that person to the dealership, but it’s usually the last click that gets all the credit,” says Mr Nichols.Another way that brands are working to get more out of online adverts is by rigorous experimentation and testing.“Kayak is a brand that lives online,” says Robert Birge, chief marketing officer of travel website Kayak.com. “Like many internet start-ups, we took an approach that was very online-focused.”Mr Birge says Kayak initially invested in paid search advertising, and relied on reputation and word-of-mouth. Recently, the company has invested in display adverts.But Mr Birge concedes that “online display is very complicated”, even for professionals. Kayak works with MediaMath, a company that provides advertising management services and technology, to buy search advertising.Equally important, is brand awareness.To hone this, Kayak runs experiments to test which adverts are most effective and how many clicks and sales different versions of adverts can generate.Some marketers think social media are an online arena that provides more clarity on what works.Nielsen has partnered with Facebook to track the effectiveness of adverts on the social network, and companies avidly count their Twitter followers, re-tweets, mentions, and “shares” on Facebook.Salesforce, the web-based customer management software provider, has embraced social media. “YouTube is transformational for us,” says Kendall Collins, chief marketing officer of Salesforce.“An event with our chief executive on stage is great, but a video is super-high fidelity, and the cost per video engagement can be very [low].”Mr Collins has sought to tie engagement in social media and the web to conversions into customers.“If you’re statistically minded and have the tools, you can correlate behaviour on your website with other behaviour,” he says.In 2007, Salesforce integrated its CRM system with the Google AdWords service. That allowed it to see quickly which keywords attract customers.But not all brands are rushing to social media.“[It] is a very hard nut to crack,” says Mr Birge. “The challenge is turning it into something that has a material impact on business. It’s hard to be a CMO and say social media aren’t your top priority.”In the absence of established metrics for online advertising, some marketers have created their own.Jim Farley, CMO of Ford, says his European team has developed a metric for the company: “cost per minute of engagement”.Encompassing the benefits of social engagement, the cost of producing content and the need to drive sales, Mr Farley says more companies may use this type of metric in years to come.“This is a highly relevant new metric in the world of social media,” he says.“If 6m people watch a minute-long video on YouTube, how does that compare with an advert on TV? The number of engagements, and the amount of time people spend with your content [can be much greater] online.”
25;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2011-01-28T20:52:04Z;Nielsen raises $1.89bn in landmark US flotation;;Nielsen, the media measurement group, has achieved the biggest private-equity led initial public offering yet in the US, at $1.89bn.Nielsen, which had initially filed to go public last year but delayed the offering as markets stalled, raised $1.65bn in a listing on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.An overallotment of shares was exercised on Friday, according to a person close to the deal. Known as a “greenshoe”, this increased the offering to 82.1m shares, which sold at $23 each, from 71.4m.According to Dealogic, Nielsen’s share sale now surpasses the $1.65bn offering of Spirit Aerosystems, the supplier to the aerospace industry, in November 2006. However, it lags behind the largest global offering yet, which was Cerberus’s $2.9bn sale of shares in Aozora Bank, also in November 2006.Global IPO issuance is set for its busiest January yet, with 81 deals raising about $10bn already priced, and an additional seven deals totalling $1.5bn expected to come to market before the end of the month, according to Dealogic.Nielsen was taken private in 2006 by six private equity firms, including KKR, Thomas H Lee Partners, Blackstone and the Carlyle Group. The additional allotment will also be used to pay down debt, according to a person close to the company.Private equity investors Blackstone, Carlyle and Wilbur Ross also sold shares in BankUnited, a troubled Florida lender they acquired in 2009, on Friday. The deal raised $783m, pricing at $27 a share, above its initial range of $23-$25.Both deals have also done well in post-issuance trading. Nielsen shares rose 8.7 per cent on Wednesday. BankUnited shares rose as much as 9.3 per cent in early trading on Friday, but were up 4.8 per cent in midday trading as US markets pulled back amid turbulence in the Middle East.“US private equity deals were the missing part of the global IPO market,” said Josef Schuster, president of IPOX Schuster, an investment fund. “Bankers will now be trying to get these deals out the door.”Mr Schuster said he anticipated an offering for HCA, the hospital group taken private in 2006 and the largest potential private-equity IPO at $4.6bn, as soon as March.Technology companies are expected to be a significant part of the rebound in issuances in 2011. LinkedIn, the business-focused social networking website, filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to sell $175m in shares.
26;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2011-01-10T23:42:09Z;Nielsen hopes to raise $1.5bn in delayed IPO;;Nielsen, the audience measurement and consumer tracking company, has revived plans for what could be the biggest initial public offering in media this year, but lowered its expectations of what it will be able to raise.The company, which was taken private in 2006, said that it would look to sell 71.4m shares, or 20 per cent of the company, at a range of $20-$22 per share.At the midpoint of the range, it would raise $1.5bn before expenses, valuing its equity at $7.5bn. Last June it set a target of raising $1.75bn, but increased this to $2bn in August.Nielsen’s offering, first mooted nine months ago, is being closely watched as a guide to market sentiment, after other smaller media companies also delayed IPO plans amid uncertain trading conditions late last year.The group, which tracks broadcast and online audiences and monitors what consumers spend in stores, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would use most of the net proceeds of about $1.42bn to reduce its total debt, which stood at $8.6bn on September 30 last year.JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are lead underwriters, with the list of other underwriters led by Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.Nielsen said it expected to raise about $240m in a concurrent offering of convertible subordinated bonds.Nielsen plans to pay about $103m to the private equity firms that bought the former VNU – AlpInvest, Blackstone, Carlyle, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H Lee – and Centerview Partners, which invested after the buy-out, one of the largest “club deals” seen in private equity at the time.Since the buy-out, interest expenses and impairment charges led to net losses totalling $1.43bn over the three years to December 2009. However, it reported compound annual growth of 6.2 per cent in revenues and 14.3 per cent in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.In 2009, it reported a net loss of $489m, adjusted ebitda of $1.3bn and flat revenues of $4.8bn. “Nielsen is tremendously debt-laden and revenues are basically flat. I do not see this as an easy sell,” said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique, an investment advisory group.A successful IPO would highlight the role of David Calhoun, the former GE executive picked to turn Nielsen round after the buy-out. According to the filing, he was granted a $10m signing bonus and is entitled to a “deferred compensation benefit” of $14.5m in January 2012.Nielsen’s filing said it planned to continue growing in developing markets, which accounted for 17 per cent of revenues in 2009, investing in new products and seeking acquisitions.
27;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-11-11T19:17:53Z;Debt market rally helps fund pay-outs;;Private equity groups have seized on a relentless rally in debt markets to extract cash from boom-era company buy-outs, exploiting low interest rates to fund “dividend deals” worth tens of billions of dollars.HCA, the US-based hospital operator taken private in 2006, this week raised more than $1.5bn at a rate of 7.75 per cent to help fund a $2bn pay-out to sponsors including Bain Capital and KKR. The transaction was the largest so-called dividend deal for private equity since 2005, according to Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary & Data.Other dividend deals have emerged this year, financed by loans and junk bonds of more than $40bn, the most since 2007 and a rate that is on track to top the dollar amount of deals sold for dividends in 2005.“Every private equity owner is looking across his portfolio for where there is manageable debt capacity to do this,” says Mark Epley, co-global head of financial sponsors at Nomura. “If the operating business is doing well, that creates room for additional leverage and you can take money off the table without diluting your position.”Several large sponsor-backed initial public offerings have been on hold this year – including HCA, which filed to list in May, and KKR-backed Toys R Us and Nielsen – rather than brave unaccommodating equity markets.But companies and private equity sponsors have been able to return to debt structures typical of the years before the financial crisis, because investors are willing to take on more risk to boost their returns as central bankers keep interest rates low to stimulate economic growth.“There is a massive, global search for yield,” said Peter Toal, Head of Americas leveraged finance syndicate at Barclays Capital. “It is a direct result of low underlying rates elsewhere.”In the wake of the crisis, the junk bond market has enjoyed record inflows and bond sales as investors, wary of the volatility of stock markets, have looked for alternatives to low yielding money market funds and bank accounts.Junk bonds this year have posted a return of 15.3 per cent, and nearly 6 per cent in the past three months, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.But private equity owners waiting for an opportunity to tap the equity markets are likely to be encouraged by their recent performance, with the S&P 500 up almost 16 per cent since the beginning of September. “If the equity markets continue to trade as they do, I would expect IPOs to come back strongly in the first quarter,” Mr Epley says.Private equity groups often need to raise sufficient new equity through a listing to reduce leverage ratios – debt levels versus earnings – closer to those of publicly listed peers. If market pricing moves against them, raising what they need can mean substantial dilution for the private equity owners.That can tip the balance in favour of using cheap debt to pay a dividend. As well as HCA, Petco, the pet supplier, has this week been arranging a $1.75bn debt package to recapitalise and fund a pay-out of up to $700m for its sponsors, Leonard Green & Partners and TPG.The loans have the loose terms that characterised many leveraged buy-outs in the boom years, a structure known as covenant lite, acc­ording to a ratings report from Standard & Poor’s.Catalina Marketing, which sells marketing strategies to manufacturers, retailers and healthcare providers, this week raised $260m through a bond sale at a holding company. The bonds do not pay interest but are repaid in full at maturity in five years, according to people familiar with the deal.Last month, BWAY Holding, a metal and plastic packaging company, sold $125m of “PIK-toggle” notes to pay a dividend to its owners, who are mainly Madison Dearborn Partners investment funds. PIK-toggle notes pay some of the interest with additional debt instead of cash.Despite the return of these deals, some observers say borrowing has not returned to the risky levels of 2006 and 2007 because overall leverage at companies remains lower than it was then.Today’s LBOs have long-term debt of about six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation versus eight and nine times at the peak of the boom, says Steven Miller, managing director at S&P LCD. Dividend deals in 2006 and 2007 had leverage of six to seven times while today’s deals are four to five times.But, as Martin Fridson, credit strategist at BNP Paribas, warns: “The danger is will it get carried away again as the cycle continues.”Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui
28;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-09-28T23:21:13Z;Asia’s TV makers jostle to realise 3D vision;;Inside a cavernous Panasonic television panel factory in Amagasaki, western Japan, GPS-guided robots whisk stacks of plasma screens down white-painted rooms hundreds of feet long.After cooking for hours in 500C heat – to fuse pairs of thin glass sheets around a layer of light-emitting gasses – the panels will be shipped to assembly plants in Japan and around the world, where they will be installed in flat-screen TV sets including state-of-the-art 3D models.Panasonic, which began selling 3D-capable versions of its Viera TVs in March, is hoping the visual feature will make consumers take a fresh look at plasma, a technology that has been overtaken by lower-cost liquid crystal displays in all but the largest models.3D video looks best on big, low-latency screens that can project fast-moving objects smoothly – a traditional advantage of plasma over LCD screens.“In the near future, almost all TVs will have 3D capability,” says Hiroyuki Nagano, president of Panasonic Plasma Display, which expanded the factory’s capacity to 9m units late last year. “3D is going to have a very significant impact on demand for plasma TVs.”Forecasting demand for any new technology is risky and that is doubly true for 3D TV – which appears to repel as many potential viewers as it attracts. Half of the respondents in a recent Nielsen survey said they were turned off by the special glasses required to watch 3D images. When those who said they were interested in buying a 3D TV actually tried one, about half changed their minds.Even so, the research firm iSuppli expects Japanese and South Korean electronics groups to sell 4m 3D TVs this year, with sales growing to 78m by 2015, or about two-fifths of the projected global flat-screen market.The manufacturers pushing 3D technology hardest – Panasonic and Sony of Japan and South Korea’s Samsung – are looking to do more than lure consumers into upgrading to fancier sets. They are also eyeing knock-on gains from related hardware and content, including 3D video cameras, game software and films.Sony, for instance, makes TVs, game consoles and video equipment, owns a film studio and is a core sponsor of Blu-ray DVDs, the only DVD format large enough to store a full-length 3D film.With 3D, it hopes to prove its diversified strategy can generate moneymaking synergies. At last week’s Tokyo Game Show, much of its display was given over to upcoming 3D video games for its PlayStation console. Attendees were invited to don 3D eyewear to frolic with a monkey-like virtual pet, using Sony’s just-released Move motion-sensing controller – a gadget the company hopes will be its answer to the popular Nintendo Wii.So far, it has been Samsung, the dominant force in the overall flat-screen TV market, that has sold the most 3D sets.“Korean companies have an advantage in terms of securing panels and other components as they are vertically integrated,” said Cho Woo-hung, analyst at Daewoo Securities.A strong Japanese yen relative to the South Korean won has also helped.Samsung has a target for this year of 2.6m units, while in the slightly later Japanese fiscal year to next March, Sony hopes to sell 2.5m and Panasonic 1m.Other manufacturers such as South Korea’s LG and Japan’s Sharp, Hitachi and Toshiba are planning or beginning to sell 3D sets.Hisakazu Torii, analyst at DisplaySearch, says there are signs that demand for the still pricey TVs could be cooling along with major market economies. “We could see some headwinds at the end of the year . . . Companies might fall short of their aggressive targets.”The damage from short-term over-investment would probably be small, however, since 3D TVs use standard plasma or LDC panels with a few small tweaks, and making them does not require expensive new factories or assembly lines.The more pressing question, analysts say, is how long producers can maintain premium prices – now about $500-$800 higher than for 2D-only models for sets larger than 42 inches.Given stiffening competition, the relatively low extra production cost and the still limited range of 3D content, it may not be long.“The premium is likely to shrink faster than manufacturers hope,” Mr Torii says.
29;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-08-19T19:20:22Z;Investors caught in balancing act over GM listing;;"As investors pored over General Motors’ 734-page initial public offering prospectus on Thursday, they weighed the prospect of acquiring a stake in a successfully restructured carmaker against the myriad risks facing GM and its industry.Some questioned the timing of the issue, which comes 13 months after the company exited bankruptcy and in an election year in which President Barack Obama’s administration seeks to defend its unpopular bail-out of Detroit.GM’s offer, expected towards the end of the year, could potentially become one of the largest in history, but has to contend with an uncertain outlook for the world economy in a year that saw other IPOs scuppered because of market volatility.At its investor roadshows, GM will seek to tout its global scale and a balance sheet freed from past liabilities and that is now the envy of many of its competitors. Reporting a $1.3bn second-quarter net profit last week, GM said it had liquidity worth $32.5bn and debt of $8.2bn at the end of June. The manufacturer was the industry’s second-largest automaker by sales after Japan’s Toyota last year, although Germany’s Volkswagen is now overtaking it. In China, the world’s biggest vehicle market, it is number two after VW.GM sold 7.5m vehicles in more than 130 countries last year and generated nearly $105bn of revenue. It exited Chapter 11 last year with smaller, more cost-competitive operations and new management that cut bureaucracy and streamlined decision-making.“I think there will be plenty of international and domestic interest in it,” Dan Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital investment bank, says of the IPO. “For those that want to buy back into a restructured auto industry, then this is a very good way to do it.”Arrayed against GM’s strengths are many questions hanging over the company’s business, which the carmaker itself outlined in the long “risk factors” section of its IPO filing, submitted late on Wednesday.These included slowing car sales in the US and overseas; a deficit in its pension funds that exceeded $27bn at end-December, and the startling admission that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting “are currently not effective”.GM and its banks have not divulged the size of its offering of common stock in New York and Toronto, which will pay no dividends. However, people close to the IPO say that it might see GM raise between $12bn and $16bn. GM will also issue convertible securities that convert to common stock after three years. The owners of these will receive dividends, broadening the offer’s appeal in an uncertain market. The proceeds from the convertible securities’ sale will be used to reduce GM’s secured debt and help pay down deficits in its pension funds, people close to the IPO say.The US government and GM’s management have said they are eager to see the Treasury’s stake of just under 61 per cent, reduced to a minority.“The government does not want to be running the largest car manufacturer in the US,” says Thomas Nyheim, vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust. “The government has stabilised the business and has done what it set out to do.”Mr Nyheim says the attractions of the IPO for investors include the fact that GM has now reduced its debt load and is profitable. Among the drawbacks, he says, are GM’s underfunded pension liabilities, the low margins and cyclical nature of the car industry and the role unionised workers play in it.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, says: “There is a lot of pressure to push this deal back into public hands over a short period of time.”By the time GM issues its shares late this year, other large deals will have tested investors’ appetite for new equity issues, including the floats of hospital operator HCA and Nielsen, the media metrics company.However, people close to the process warned that a delay of the IPO was possible should market volatility rise. “The hope is that after Labor Day, people return and start putting money to work,” one person close to the process says.GM’s top executives have a strong personal interest in seeing the company floated successfully and at a generous valuation.Chris Liddell, GM’s chief financial officer, is eligible for $3.45m of stock awards, as well as $2m of restricted stock valued at $53.98 per share, on top of his salary of $750,000. Steve Girsky, GM’s head of corporate strategy and business development, is entitled to stock totalling $4.5m, on top of his $500,000 salary.Ed Whitacre, GM’s outgoing CEO, is eligible for stock worth $7.3m on top of his $1.7m salary. GM said that his final compensation and that of Daniel Akerson, who will take over as CEO on September 1, are still being determined."
30;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-08-01T15:02:59Z;Gillard under pressure in Australia poll race;;Julia Gillard, Australia’s prime minister, is under pressure to reinvigorate her election campaign after a string of leaks from within her centre-left Labor party were blamed for a sharp drop in the government’s standing in opinion polls.With less than three weeks before a national election, a newspaper poll at the weekend found Labor was behind the opposition coalition parties for the first time since June, when Kevin Rudd was controversially ousted by his own party as the country’s leader.The Herald/Nielsen poll found Labor’s support had plunged 6 percentage points in a single week to 48 per cent, with the opposition coalition parties gaining by the same amount to 52 per cent, giving them an election-winning margin.The reversal in the government’s fortunes came after a poor second week of the election campaign when Ms Gillard was dogged by claims – widely attributed to Mr Rudd’s camp – that she argued against paid parental leave and increases to pension payments.In a rare unscripted moment, the prime minister angrily denied the allegations but she also conceded she felt the need to scrutinise the policies because they amounted to more than A$50bn (US$45bn) worth of government spending over 10 years. Days later, it emerged that Ms Gillard, when deputy prime minister, had sent a member of her staff and a former bodyguard to represent her at national security committee meetings.Senior Labor figures are increasingly worried that the continued focus on Mr Rudd, who is seeking re-election in his Queensland constituency, will damage the government’s chances of securing a second term in office. Mr Rudd disappeared from the campaign at the end of last week after he was admitted to hospital to have his gall bladder removed.But the former PM remained in the limelight at the weekend after a newspaper report claimed that as a backbencher in the then Howard government, Mr Rudd was used by the ruling centre-right coalition as a “double agent” to leak stories to the detriment of the Labor party. Mr Rudd issued a statement denying the allegation.With Ms Gillard’s brief honeymoon period over barely six weeks into the job, the prime minister agreed at the weekend she faced a battle to be elected. “This is the fight of my life,” she said.Tony Abbott, leader of the opposition coalition parties, attempted to play down his party’s bounce in the polls, insisting he remained the underdog in the campaign.An aggregate of five of Australia’s leading opinion polls still has Labor’s support at 52 per cent. However, political commentators said clear trends had emerged in recent weeks – the government was losing ground to the opposition, particularly in Queensland, and Mr Abbott was gaining in popularity.Ms Gillard, who is unmarried and has no children, has not been helped by increasing media scrutiny over her personal life, and in particular her decision not to bring her long-time partner Tim Mathieson in the campaign. By contrast, Mr Abbott’s family credentials have been bolstered by the appearance of his wife and daughters on the election trail.The prime minister has also been repeatedly asked to defend her role in the toppling of Mr Rudd. During the leaders’ only televised debate a week ago, she said she had to take a difficult decision to put her duty to the Australian people ahead of her duty to Mr Rudd.Mr Rudd’s popularity collapsed earlier this year after a series of policy u-turns and the introduction of the controversial mining profits tax.
31;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-07-25T18:56:46Z;Global spirits fail to lift shoppers’ hopes;;Britain’s shoppers have less faith in the economy than they did last quarter, against a trend for growing optimism around the world.The British Retail Consortium index of consumer confidence fell for the first time since April 2009 to a level of 78, two points lower than last quarter. A score of 100 implies a balance between positive and negative outlooks.With the global average for the period increasing one point to 93, the UK trails much of the Middle East and Asia in terms of consumer confidence, and is also behind the US and Germany. UK shoppers are, however, more optimistic than those in France.The gloomy outlook emerged in a survey conducted in May and released on Monday by market research firm Nielsen and the BRC. For the great majority of UK consumers, the economy still feels as though it is contracting, the survey finds. Technically, most experts agree the recession ended in late 2009, but 82 per cent of survey respondents believe the UK is still in recession.Only 17 per cent of those who believe the UK to be in recession think the country will return to growth in the next 12 months – a sharp fall since the last survey carried out in March. Then, nearly one-third of those who believed the economy to be in recession thought growth would return within the year.Disregarding the debate about a double-dip recession, most UK consumers never felt – or believed in – a recovery, the survey results suggest. For them, the recession never went away.Their pessimism also appears to be on the rise. The number of respondents considering the economy their primary concern rose sharply to 22 per cent, the highest it has been since at least October 2008.When asked what they would buy with spare cash, 22 per cent of UK respondents answered: “I have no spare cash.”The BRC survey, which is carried out online every quarter and records responses from 27,000 consumers in 55 markets, was run between May 10 and May 30, before and after the UK election.
32;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-07-21T02:28:20Z;Warm weather boosts UK supermarkets;;World Cup boozers and the warm summer weather have boosted sales at UK supermarkets in recent weeks, with leading grocery retailers selling a record level of goods on promotion, lifting revenue on crisps, soft drinks and alcohol.“It’s pretty difficult to separate the effects of the two out, but looking at the categories that are up, it’s more an effect of the weather than the World Cup,” said Fraser McKevitt, retail analyst at Kantar Worldpanel.“But in both of those cases, it’s the same kind of things that saw a big uplift. Beer sales grew strongly, and so did burgers and ice-cream. All those things are consumed in the sunshine and at barbecues watching the football.”Supermarket sales grew by 4.4 per cent in the 12 weeks to the middle of July, according to Kantar, the fastest rate of growth since February. A record 35 per cent of grocery store sales were sold on promotion during the period.Data from Nielsen released on Tuesday also showed that most of the growth came from World Cup or summer-related goods. Grocery retailers saw a surge in the sales of alcohol, crisps and soft drinks in the early summer, with sales of beer, wine and spirits up 11 per cent in the four weeks to the middle of June, and 9 per cent in the four weeks to mid-July. Sales of crisps and snacks grew by 10 per cent in the four weeks to the middle of July, with soft drinks up 8 per cent in the same period.However, Mike Watkins, senior manager of retail services at Nielsen, cautioned that outside of these promotional items, growth in regular grocery sales was sluggish.“People were happy to buy into the big booze promotions, but they weren’t at the same time spending more money on other food and drink,” he said.The two fastest-growing retailers in the period were Waitrose and Iceland, data from Kantar show, with sales increases of 11.3 per cent and 11.4 per cent, respectively, compared with the same period in 2009. Independent retailers also saw strong sales growth, up 6.9 per cent in the period.
33;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-06-03T18:25:40Z;Nielsen aims to raise $1.75bn in IPO;;Nielsen Holdings BV, the world’s largest audience measurement company, aims to raise $1.75bn in the biggest US initial public offering so far this year, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.People familiar with the plan said the company was likely to wait until as late as the fourth quarter to price the offering, in order to gauge how the company is performing financially in the second half of the year.Nielsen’s IPO, which is also the ninth-largest offering in the world this year, according to data from Thomson Reuters, will be a big test of investor appetite.This year, 57 IPOs have been abandoned globally, with a total value of $31.7bn. European and Asian markets have seen more IPOs abandoned this year than in any other comparable period since records began in 1995, according to data provider Dealogic.JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are lead underwriters for the Nielsen offering. Other underwriters include Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs, although other co-managers may sign on at a later date, people familiar with the plan said.It was not immediately clear what percentage of the company would be offered to the public or what the implied valuation would be from the filing. Nielsen plans to use the proceeds from the offering to repay a part of its $8.66bn in total debt and for other general corporate purposes.The company, which operates the world’s largest consumer tracking and television viewing measurement businesses, was taken private by a consortium of private equity firms in a landmark €7.6bn ($9.3bn) buy-out in 2006 featuring six private equity groups: Alpinvest, Blackstone, Carlyle, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H Lee.The Financial Times reported in April that Nielsen’s owners hoped a forthcoming public offering would value the company’s equity and debt at about 11 to 13 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.One person in contact with Nielsen said this week that potential investors in the offering considered a more reasonable valuation to be at a lower level of 10 to 11 times ebitda.Nielsen said its adjusted ebitda was $1.3bn at the end of last year, reflecting a 13.9 per cent rise in compounded annual growth since 2006.Nielsen controls the dominant US television viewing measurement system and operates in 29 countries. More than $70bn in US TV advertising spending relies on its measurement of viewership of free-to-air and pay TV programmes.Its TV and online audience tracking business accounted for a third of its 2009 revenue of $4.8bn. Its retail sales and consumer behaviour tracking business accounted for 62 per cent of 2009 revenue.
34;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-05-21T19:48:41Z;Online sites alter view on TV ratings;;US marketing group Optimedia has introduced a television rating measure that highlights how social networking sites are changing marketers’ definition of a TV hit. The measure, which incorporates online and mobile audiences, how many Facebook friends a show has and sentiment on blogs, suggests pay-TV channels and smaller networks now have the same chance of capturing advertisers’ budgets as large broadcast network shows.For example, True Blood, a vampire show from Time Warner’s HBO which ranked 131 in traditional TV ratings, came 18th in the media buying agency’s “content power ratings”.Gossip Girl, a teen drama on the CW Network, jumped from 125 in Nielsen’s TV ratings to 14 by Optimedia’s measure, which seeks to capture “advocacy” and “involvement” – both qualities that advertisers believe improve audience’s engagement with their commercials.“Brands are putting their money in shows that don’t necessarily have the ratings but have something else – they like the association with the show or the audience engagement,” said Antony Young, chief executive of Optimedia US, a Publicis-owned agency.Audience fragmentation and the rise of sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter has increased demand for new methods to evaluate shows’ impact on the audience and, by extension, their value to advertisers.Optimedia said it would use its CPR model to help clients go beyond standard measures of age, sex and income to target multimedia campaigns to shows that resonate most with their target audiences.The CPR ratings, released to chime with this week’s “upfront” season in which advertisers get a glimpse of broadcasters’ plans for the autumn and spring seasons, use data including Nielsen BuzzMetrics, ComScore’s Media Metrix, Google Trends and press mentions.Morgan Stanley expects advertisers to commit 10-15 per cent more money in this season’s upfronts than in 2009, with revenue per spot up 5 per cent or more.“The market is hotting up but advertisers are not sure they’ll follow,” Mr Young cautioned. “Last year networks had a floor [under the pricing they would accept]. This year advertisers have a ceiling [on what they will pay].”American Idol on News Corp’s Fox network retained the highest audiences on television, online and mobile, but Fox’s House led the Facebook fan league table, and Lost, the mystery series now ending on Disney’s ABC, registered the most positive BuzzMetrics score.Glee, also on Fox, was the CPR list’s top newcomer, thanks to “chatter and advocacy” from a karaoke contest and “biggest Gleek” competition online.True Blood ranked first among cable shows, even though HBO is a premium channel that requires an additional monthly payment on the cable bill, while Dexter, Big Love, Weeds and Entourage were other paid cable properties that scored in Optimedia’s top 100 shows.
35;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-04-25T22:00:51Z;Buy-out firms prepare to float Nielsen;;Nielsen, the world’s largest TV and consumer measurement company, will begin auditioning bankers next month for one of the largest US initial public offerings in recent years.Nielsen’s private equity owners hope the offering, expected this year, will value the company’s equity and debt at up to $21bn, according to people familiar with their plans.The flotation will be a test of US investors’ appetite for IPOs after a tepid first quarter weighed down by uncertainty over the strength of the economic recovery.Almost 20 technology, media and telecom groups filed for IPOs in the first quarter, according to a report this month by investment bank Jefferies, but all were far smaller.Nielsen, which tracks TV viewership and consumer shopping habits, was taken private in a landmark €7.6bn ($10bn) buy-out in 2006 featuring six private equity firms: Alpinvest, Blackstone, Carlyle, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H Lee.These private equity firms hoped the IPO would value the company – formerly VNU – at 11 to 13 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, people familiar with the plans said.Nielsen should make about $1.6bn in ebitda this year, according to one person familiar with its finances.That would imply ambitions to achieve a $17bn to $21bn enterprise value for Nielsen, including the company’s $8.66bn debt at the end of 2009.Bankers said there were few directly comparable companies to provide valuation benchmarks for Nielsen, but IMS Health, a provider of prescription-drug data, was sold last year for more than nine times its 2009 ebitda.Nielsen declined to comment.Several people said Nielsen had distributed requests for proposals to banks last Wednesday to prepare for a “beauty parade” next month, which could involve six to eight banks.It is unclear how much of the company the consortium plans to sell, but they could keep a majority stake and sell the rest in stages after a lock-up period.The IPO would probably be structured to both repay debt and allow Nielsen’s owners to realise some gains.Nielsen’s debt levels led two bankers not yet involved with the IPO process to express scepticism about Nielsen’s appeal to investors. Other bankers, however, hailed its stability, strong market position and well-regarded management.Impairment charges and interest costs led Nielsen to report a net loss of $490m from flat revenue of $4.8bn in 2009. The company, which is to issue its first-quarter earnings on Friday, has paid about $500m in cash interest annually since 2007.More than 60 per cent of Nielsen’s revenues come from measuring and analysing consumer purchases, with one third from media measurement and, after it sold its trade magazines, 4 per cent from trade shows.
36;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-04-10T03:20:27Z;Tiger Woods’ return draws in millions;;Tiger Woods has dispelled doubts about his continued commercial appeal by drawing record-breaking television and online audiences for his return to professional golf after months of tabloid scandal.ESPN, the Walt Disney-owned sports channel with the rights to live coverage of the first two rounds of the US Masters, said the golfer’s first round of the Masters Tournament on Thursday had been “the most-viewed golf telecast in cable history”.An estimated 4.9m people tuned in to ESPN to see Mr Woods tee off for the first time since his admission of serial infidelity, 47 per cent above the audience for the opening day of the 2009 Masters and more than the 4.76m people who watched his Monday play-off with Rocco Mediate for the 2008 US Open championship.Mr Woods’ position high up on the leaderboard as he made his way around the course to applause from the packed crowds, bodes well for CBS, which will air the final rounds of the US Masters on Saturday and Sunday.“He’s perfectly positioned for this to be huge. This is about as good a set-up as you could have hoped for,” said Larry Gerbrandt, principal of Media Valuation Partners.“If he stays in contention on the final day, I think we could definitely have a shot at breaking all-time records.”Mr Woods holds the record for the most watched Masters, when 20.3m viewers watched him win the tournament for the first time in 1997, or 14.1 per cent of all US households, according to Nielsen.CBSSports.com, which showed the first day’s play online, reported that more than 556,000 unique users, more than double the visitors it had seen a year earlier, watched 71 per cent more live video.Mr Woods also cemented his commercial rehabilitation this week with a black-and-white advertisement for Nike, his most loyal sponsor.In the ad he stares blank-faced at the camera, dressed in Nike-branded gear, as the voice of his late father intones “did you learn anything?”By Friday afternoon, the commercial had been watched 2m times on YouTube.Mr Woods was the most bankable star in sports.However, he was abruptly dropped by sponsors, including Accenture, after a late night car crash outside his house unleashed a torrent of lurid revelations about his personal life.A fortune in endorsements, broadcast rights and prize money is riding on his continued success.“For Tiger, this is about new sponsors and repairing his marketability, not necessarily getting old sponsors back,” Mr Gerbrandt said.
37;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-04-04T18:09:07Z;Consumer brands buck trend in ad spending;;Consumer goods brands increased their advertising spending more than any other industry during the recession, according to research by Nielsen, propelled by growth in Asia even as the rest of the global media market plummeted.The media monitoring company said advertising spending by fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble had risen 10.6 per cent in 2009 from the previous year, according to Nielsen.Within FMCG companies, drinks saw the biggest uptick in spending, at 20.2 per cent over the year, with food and housekeeping products up 11.6 per cent and 12.8 per cent respectively. Cosmetics and toiletries’ ad spend increase was a more modest 4 per cent during 2009, although any growth marks the sector out at a time when global media spending is estimated to have fallen 7-9 per cent.Nielsen found that FMCGs’ pace of marketing investment had accelerated dramatically during the course of 2009, from flat growth in the first quarter to 21.5 per cent growth in the fourth quarter, a rate that took even experienced market-watchers by surprise. That in part was a result of weaker comparisons but also reflected the rapid rebound of emerging markets such as China and India, which have large internal markets.Asia-Pacific was the only region to show growth in the media sector, according to Nielsen, with a 6.6 per cent rise from 2008.Indonesia, still a relatively small market, showed the biggest increase, at 16.4 per cent growth.But China, which is already one of the world’s leading media markets, still reported a remarkable 14.9 per cent rise in advertising spending.Television was the biggest beneficiary of the Asian recovery, showing growth of 10.4 per cent in the region, as TV in North America and Europe saw revenues fall 5.6 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively. Asian radio also saw growth but advertising spending in newspapers was flat and magazines declined 6.4 per cent, reflecting print media’s struggle to attract investment from brands around the world. Spain, Ireland and Italy saw the biggest drops in spending.In spite of the resilience in Asia, Michele Strazzera, deputy managing director of Nielsen’s Global Adview unit, said the advertising market would take several years to recover to its 2008 peak. “2009 was probably the bottom, and 2010 will see stability,” he said. “So hopefully 2011 will be the year when we see some growth and maybe in 2012 we can have the same [market] value as 2007.”Carat, the media agency owned by Aegis Group, forecasts 2.9 per cent growth this year and 4.0 per cent in 2010.As expected, automotive, clothing and financial companies made the biggest reductions to their marketing budgets in 2009, all making double-digit cutbacks. Only distribution and healthcare followed consumer goods companies in raising investment.Based on analysis of media owners’ published rate cards, magazines showed the greatest decline in value, falling 16.4 per cent globally. “[Advertisers] have to choose the media to reach the broadest audience possible and TV is still the safest way,” said Mr Strazzera. “Also you have to be very flexible in the planning. With magazines, you have to book the space a long time before.”Internet advertising was the only medium to see growth in most countries where it was tracked.
38;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-03-29T22:14:20Z;Smartphone boom poised to set tone in US;;Sales of smartphones in the US such as the iPhone, BlackBerry and Motorola Droid will overtake sales of older-generation “feature phones” by the end of next year, according to the Nielsen research company.Smartphone sales in the US will climb steadily over the next 18 months and account for just under 50 per cent of total sales by the autumn of next year, predicts a new report prepared by Roger Entner, a telecom analyst at Nielsen.“We are just at the beginning of a new wireless era where smartphones will become the standard device consumers will use to connect to friends, the internet and the world at large,” he said.Feature phones, which typically include integrated cameras and multimedia capabilities, still account for over 70 per cent of sales, but sophisticated smartphones, which can be customised with downloaded software or “apps”, are closing the gap quickly.“The share of smartphones as a proportion of overall device sales has increased to 29 per cent for phone purchasers in the last six months, and 45 per cent of respondents to a Nielsen survey indicated their next device will be a smartphone,” he said.His comments echo those of other industry analysts at Gartner and IDC and by phonemakers such as Sanjay Jha, chief executive of Motorola’s mobile phone business.“All phones will be smartphones eventually,” Mr Jha said during a recent interview with the Financial Times.Heavy media advertising, coupled with the success of online app stores, especially Apple’s, which now offers over 100,000 free and low-cost apps, has helped fuel the surge in US smartphone sales over the past 18 months.Nevertheless, Mr Entner forecasts further growth. At the end of last year only 21 per cent of American wireless subscribers were using a smartphone compared with 19 per cent in the previous quarter and just 14 per cent at the end of 2008.“If we combine these intentional data points with falling prices and increasing capabilities of these devices along with a explosion of applications, for devices, we are seeing the beginning of a groundswell. This increase will be so rapid that by the end of 2011 Nielsen expects more smartphones in the US market than feature phones,” he said.Analysts expect growth in the US to be matched in other markets.Smartphones now account for 48 per cent of worldwide traffic on AdMob’s mobile advertising network, up from 35 per cent a year ago. AdMob, which serves more of 10bn ads per month to more than 15,000 mobile websites and applications, also notes that Android-based smartphone usage in the US has surged in recent months. Forty-two per cent of AdMob’s smartphone audience in the US are now using Android-based devices, almost the same percentage using iPhones.
39;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-03-22T17:29:14Z;US web use down, TV viewing up – Nielsen;;A family argument over whether that was John Barryman on Desperate Housewives last night was resolved with a quick search on the turned-on laptop by our side (I won!).Unlike John Barryman’s appearance, this is not a rare occurrence apparently – web-surfing is not replacing TV-watching but supplementing and even boosting it, according to research from The Nielsen Company.Its Three Screen Report, which tracks consumption across TV, the web and mobile phones found that simultaneous use of the internet while watching TV by Americans reached three-and-a-half hours a month in the final quarter of 2009 – up 35 per cent from the year-ago quarter.Nielsen says nearly 60 per cent of TV viewers now use the internet once a month while also watching TV.Live TV viewing itself grew slightly over the past year – by an hour to 154 hours a month, while internet use was down 2 per cent to 26.5 hours.“The initial fear was that internet and mobile video and entertainment would slowly cannibalise traditional TV viewing, but the steady trend of increased TV viewership alongside expanded simultaneous usage argues something quite different,” said Matt O’Grady of Nielsen.“The rise in simultaneous use of the web and TV gives the viewer a unique on-screen and off-screen relationship with TV programming.”I’m not typical but I do find myself going to TV show websites, IMDB and Wikipedia while watching TV shows and movies to check on characters, actors and plot lines. This kind of behaviour increases show loyalty and represents an opportunity for the networks, studios and advertisers – NBC has excelled with Web-TV cross-promotion on shows like The Office.Hulu and other sites are also helping with their catch-up services for those missing episodes. Nielsen says online video consumption grew 16 per cent on last year and 44 per cent of it is being consumed in the workplace.“The research shows that Americans watch network programs online when they miss an episode or when a TV is not available,” it says.“Online video is used essentially like DVR and not typically [as] a replacement for watching TV.”
40;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2010-02-06T01:09:08Z;Skin-lightening creams in India;;"“Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?” asks the Queen in the children’s fairytale Snow White. Traditionally, it is women who subject their reflections to such scrutiny but in India the question might well come from a man.The market for skin-whitening cosmetic products in India is flourishing: sales have increased 17 per cent from a year earlier, to Rs20.5bn ($432m) in the nine months to September 2009, according to the marketing and advertising research firm Nielsen Company. And as the market expands, make-up and skincare companies are increasingly marketing creams based on “skin lightening technology” towards men as well as women, with the implicit assumption that the whiter the skin, the more attractive the person.Garnier, owned by the L’Oréal Group, the world’s largest cosmetics company, launched Garnier Men in India in May last year, including the PowerLight range of skin-lightening grooming products. John Abraham, a model, Bollywood actor, star of the film Water, and idol to hundreds of potential consumers, is the brand ambassador. “Today Indian men are big time into grooming,” said Abraham at last year’s launch. “They look after themselves and want to look good, too. But there are not enough products to meet their growing needs, at least not of international quality.”Hindustan Unilever’s Fair & Lovely, which was launched in 1978, is the market leader in women’s lightening skincare. The beauty and healthcare group Emami launched the male equivalent, Fair & Handsome, in 2005. It is billed as “the world’s No 1 fairness cream” and, as the male market leader, achieved sales of $13m in 2008. Shahrukh Khan, another Bollywood superstar, is its brand ambassador. “I share a long and fruitful association with the Emami Group and this is yet another step toward strengthening my faith in them and their products,” Khan says on the Fair & Handsome website.Khan’s endorsement of the whitening product was, however, met with criticism from Asian campaigners who claim skin-whitening creams perpetuate a cultural myth about the aesthetic and social superiority of fairer skin.Tarun Tahiliani, an Indian fashion designer who has dressed Jemima Khan and Bollywood actresses Aishwarya Rai and Shilpa Shetty, says: “The real tragedy is that people who are not fair suffer complexes, feel inferior and are often discriminated against purely because of their skin tone. And yet we glorify movie stars, most of whom are multimillionaires, who in endorsing these creams (all the while insisting that they only endorse products they believe in) perpetuate the myth further: that fair is beautiful.”“Sadly, the majority of India’s population wants to be fairer and more ‘white,’” says Chaitanya Rao, one of India’s leading young fashion designers. “When Fair & Lovely first arrived, it was amazing how often it appeared in cosmetic bags belonging to men during the security checks. The obsession with being ‘fair’ is deeply rooted in Indian culture.”Despite the controversy attached to such products, many mainstream brands, spotting a lucrative gap in the market, have expanded into ethnic skincare. L’Oréal Dermo-Expertise White is a well-known skincare brand aimed at whitening and is sold in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan; the DiorSnow skincare range, launched in 2001, promises to enhance the skin’s translucency; and Estée Lauder’s CyberWhite EX, a brightening skincare system launched in 2008, which claims to reduce skin pigmentation, was specifically created and tested in Asia.Ruby Hammer, the Bangladesh-born make-up artist and founder of the Ruby & Millie make-up range, says there is a clear perception in India, and Asia as a whole, that paler skin is more attractive. “On the Indian subcontinent, irrespective of sex, anyone with fairer skin is perceived as better-looking, smarter and, in every way, superior. In the Far East as well, in Korea, Taiwan and Japan for example, the more porcelain, clear, and blemish-free the skin is, the more beautiful it is. When I used to work with make-up for Asian brides, very often the mother of the bride would come to me and ask that her daughter be made to look paler, or more ‘fair’.”Across Asia there are cultural traditions – from the chalking of geishas’ faces in Japan, to the effects of Spanish colonisation in the Philippines where dark and light skin continues to be polarised on the social scale – that reflect and reinforce the idea that the fairer the skin, the better.“The creams that are legally available on the open market are safe, and can produce a mild reduction in pigmentation – ie, lightening the darker patches – but this is always temporary,” says Dr Nick Lowe, a consultant dermatologist at the Cranley Clinic in London. “There are some products which can be used for skin lightening that must only be used in regular consultation with a dermatologist.”……………………Detailswww.hul.co.in

41;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2009-12-02T04:00:44Z;Nielsen turns to internet usage;;Nielsen, the dominant tracker of television viewing, will begin measuring internet usage across its national panel of US television viewers by August next year, accelerating a plan to offer its network clients the ability to gauge the impact of online videos.Of the 18,000 households in its national panel of viewers, about 7,500 have agreed to have their habits tracked online. The sample size represents 20,000 people and 12,000 computers, Nielsen said. Currently, internet usage is only tracked across about 375 homes.Nielsen separately monitors about 200,000 computers in its online panel.The acceleration of a plan to measure online video viewing from its national panel of homes, by which $70bn of US television advertising prices are set, comes as television networks from Disney’s ABC to News Corp’s Fox network, and advertisers such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever, have demanded better accounting of television and internet viewing.Although representing about 2 per cent of overall US video viewing, an explosion in interest in online video sites such as Google’s YouTube online video service and Hulu, an online video joint venture of US TV broadcast networks, have irked media executives.On average, advertising revenue rates per programming hour are higher on traditional television compared with internet sites such as Hulu.In September, 14 of the world’s largest advertisers, ad agencies and television networks formed the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement to speed the research of new methods to measure TV and internet viewing.Nielsen’s plan could potentially boost the measured ratings of some shows that belong to cable networks participating in a plan called TV Everywhere, which aims to offer shows online to consumers who subscribe to a pay-TV plan.The internet shows will carry identical ads to the terrestrial channels and can then be tracked across TVs and computers.Nielsen, which will begin deploying internet meters in its panel on December 23, will detail its strategy to combine the ratings from TV and computer viewing in the next few weeks, according to a Nielsen memo sent to clients.

But he warned: “Anything can change in the blink of an eye.”It was no surprise that there were few big announcements other than a handful of otherwise prosaic announcements related to the improvement of audience measurement on the internet.“The growing importance of digital media has created an increased expectation of accountability and measurement,” Lee Doyle, chief executive of mediaedge:cia North America, told the Financial Times.Omniture, a web analytics tool company, and comScore, an online traffic measurement provider, struck a partnership to improve measurement of internet audiences by combining data from websites and information from a panel of 2m internet users.Separately, Nielsen, the dominant force in audience measurement, struck a deal to help Facebook, the top internet social network, determine the effectiveness of ads on the homepage even if users did not click on them.“There’s an awakening among media companies and advertisers that the traditional way of measuring digital media – impressions and clicks – is beyond insufficient and may be detrimental to the health of the industry,” said John Burbank, chief executive of Nielsen Online.Discussions about the “digital future” in previous years were replaced by plans for the “digital present”, Mr Doyle said. As advertisers race to shift money traditionally spent on television and print media to online sources next year, they are demanding better accountability of a medium where results can differ in the tens of millions visitors among measurement sources.These discussions are already paying off said Jeff Levick, head of advertising at AOL, who spent the week in conversations centered on digital strategies, better measurement, and better tools. AOL announced a big online display advertising campaign for Ikea, the Swedish furniture maker.“Advertisers are peeking their heads above water and looking for sky,” Mr Levick said.
43;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2009-09-22T20:03:08Z;Facebook to form alliance with Nielsen;;Facebook on Tuesday said it would form a partnership with Nielsen, the market research company, in an effort further to legitimise itself as a mainstream advertising platform.The partnership will enable Facebook to offer advertisers more information about how users are responding to ads on the largest social network in the world, with 300m users.“Using our research polls and Nielsen analysis, we can tell you who saw your ad, what they think of your product, and whether they intend to make a purchase in the future,” said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook chief operating officer.The companies’ first joint product will be a tool called BrandLift, which will offer Facebook users the chance to respond to short polls to gauge consumer attitude and purchase intent in response to the display ads. With BrandLift, Facebook users will see surveys in the same spaces where they see advertisements.Facebook, which has faced a backlash from users over privacy concerns and the use of their content, has promised that the queries will be optional and that the frequency of surveys will be controlled.“Facebook is an increasingly vital link between consumers and brands,” said John Burbank, chief executive of Nielsen’s online division. “We will now be able to add deep knowledge of this important social network to our unmatched media measurement and consumer insight.”The move comes as Nielsen faces a challenge from a consortium that threatens its role as the dominant force in television audience measurement. Members include NBC Universal, Time Warner, News Corp, Procter & Gamble, AT&T and Unilever.The new group hopes to provide better information about audience engagement and rationalise ads that run on multiple platforms, at a time when advertisers, pinched by the recession, are looking for more information about the value of investing in social media.“Advertisers have struggled with what is the value of an ad in social media,” said Shelby Saville, digital director at Spark Communications. “Right now marketers and agencies are pushing for higher levels of accountability.”A new race for better web measurement is on, and signing the largest social network could pay dividends for Nielsen as Facebook continues to grow.Facebook has been one of the fastest growing websites on the internet but has been under pressure to prove it can be profitable. It overcame a hurdle last week, when it said it had achieved a positive cash flow nearly a year ahead of schedule. It is expected to achieve gross revenues of more than $500m this year.
44;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2009-09-01T20:09:26Z;US media lose $10bn advertising in first half;;More than $10bn in advertising disappeared from US media markets in the first six months of this year, according to new data that show intense pressure on media owners and ad agencies as they search for other business models.Preliminary figures from Nielsen show a 15.4 per cent year-on-year decline in US advertising revenues, the largest drop for any period in the decade since the marketing and media measurement group began compiling such reports.The study showed sharp differences in the behaviour of different media and product categories, with cable television the only medium on which ad spend increased, up 1.5 per cent across English language channels and up 0.6 per cent for Spanish channels.By contrast “spot” advertising, booked at short notice, fell by 17.4 per cent in the top 100 local TV markets and by 32.1 per cent in the 110 next largest markets. Even internet advertising, from which Nielsen’s excludes search engine spending, slipped 1 per cent.Newspapers, for some time the weakest media performers because of the online migration of classified advertising, turned in further heavy declines. Local and national newspapers saw 13.2 per cent and 22.8 per cent falls respectively, as Sunday supplement advertising dropped 22.4 per cent nationally and 45.7 per cent locally.Magazines fared no better, with falls of 21.2 per cent for national titles, 25.4 per cent for local brands and 31.8 per cent for business-to-business magazines.Changing spending patterns among the largest advertising groups highlighted economic pressures, with carmakers cutting budgets by 31.4 per cent to $3.68bn and local dealers cutting by 26.2 per cent to $1.69bn.Growth came instead from “as seen on TV” direct response products, typically sold through “infomercials”, which increased spending by 6.7 per cent to $1.26bn. Fast food restaurants overtook drug companies as the second-biggest spenders, with a 5.1 per cent increase to $2.2bn.Annie Touliatos, of Niel­sen’s, said: “What’s interesting is that we’re not just seeing a rise in spending for recession-friendly products like fast food restaurants. We’re seeing a lot more promotion of technological innovations like smartphones, computer software and consumer-driven websites.”Advertising for multi-function smartphones more than doubled, boosted by heavy ads for Apple handsets even before the July launch of the iPhone 3G S.
45;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2009-08-13T22:45:59Z;TV ratings shake-up challenges Nielsen;;Top US media companies and marketers have created a consortium to challenge the dominant force in TV audience measurement.Nielsen controls the measurement of US audiences through the polling of 18,000 homes, where viewer habits are measured by clicks of a special remote control.Media participants in the consortium – including networks owned by NBC Universal, Time Warner, News Corp, Viacom, CBS, Discovery and Walt Disney – expect it to be operational by September.They have pulled in Procter & Gamble and AT&T, the top and third-biggest US advertisers, and Unilever. The involvement of such big names highlights how urgently advertisers feel the need for better information to justify ads that run across multiple media platforms.Media agencies GroupM, owned by WPP, and Starcom MediaVest are also joining.Audience measurement is considered the lifeblood of the media industry. The $70bn spent on US TV advertising each year is allocated according to viewer numbers. The explosion of online viewing has made the measuring of total audiences across all media platforms more difficult.“The most deficient thing is there’s no single source measurement [for TV and digital video],” Sam Armando, senior vice-president of audience analysis at Starcom Mediavest, told the Financial Times.It was not a case of “let’s go out to replace Nielsen”, he said, but the consortium’s plan did not require a “leap of faith”.People briefed on the plans expected the consortium to award contracts for measuring set-top box data and cross-platform viewers across TV and digital sources as early as the fourth quarter of this year.Media companies have tangled with Nielsen in the past, most notably after it replaced print diaries with remote controls, which led to perceived undercounting.But the explosion of online videos and the creation of initiatives such as Hulu and TV Everywhere have made improving measurement more urgent.Nielsen measures the interaction of TV and internet video usage through a “convergence” panel of about 2,800 people, but these are not officially part of the national sample from which ratings are based. A full roll-out is expected by 2011.“Nielsen continues to measure across all screens because that’s clearly our clients’ priority,” Nielsen said.
46;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2009-07-09T21:44:33Z;Retailers heed call of online word of mouth;;Global consumers have further increased their reliance on online product reviews at the expense of traditional channels of advertising, according to research by the Nielsen Company.The data underline the fact that there has been a surge of interest from retailers and manufacturers in so-called “word-of-mouth” marketing on the internet.A twice-yearly survey of more than 25,000 online consumers in 50 countries in April found that 70 per cent trusted product reviews posted online, an increase of 9 percentage points on April 2007.Trust in newspaper advertisements declined 2 percentage points to 63 per cent, while the share of respondents who trusted television advertisement increased 6 points to 62 per cent.Recommendations from friends and acquaintances remained the most trusted form of endorsement, increasing 12 percentage points to 92 per cent over the past two years.Jonathan Carson, head of Nielsen’s international online business, said the results reflected the “explosion” in consumer-generated media during the last couple of years. The company tracks more than 100m sources, he said.“Consumers’ reliance on word of mouth in the decision-making process, either from people they know or from online consumers they don’t, has increased significantly,” Mr Carson said.The report found considerable regional variations in the level of trust accorded to consumer opinions posted online.Among Vietnamese internet consumers the online trust figure was 81 per cent, but it was by only 50 per cent for Finns. In the US, the online trust figure was 72 per cent.After initial hesitancy, leading US retailers and brands have embraced online product reviews in the past three years. Increasingly they use independent service providers, which keep track of and analyse the opinions posted. Some US retailers have incorporated this customer-generated material into their broader marketing efforts.Bazaarvoice, the leading online review provider, is working with Sephora, the upmarket beauty and cosmetic store owned by LVMH, to direct customers in its stores to customer reviews available by mobile phone.Several of its clients are incorporating such reviews into traditional marketing channels such as mail-order catalogues.Consumer companies and retailers are setting up discussion and review elements on their websites with increasing speed. Sears Holdings, the retailer, recently launched two such sites – MySears.com and MyKmart.com. The retail group offers monthly prizes to encourage customers to write product reviews.The Nielsen survey found that the level of trust in most forms of advertising had increased, including brand websites.Mr Carson suggested that this could in part be because of the influence of consumer-generated media. “It’s possible that the CGM revolution has forced advertisers to use a more realistic form of messaging that is grounded in the experience of consumers, rather than the lofty ideals of the advertisers.”
47;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2009-06-10T12:28:06Z;Further fall in US ad spending;;Any recovery in marketing spending is likely to lag behind the economic recovery, WPP’s media monitoring firm has warned, as the US advertising market declined further in the first quarter.TNS Media Intelligence on Wednesday said US advertising spending fell 14.2 per cent to $30.2bn in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period of 2008. The decline accelerated from from a 9.2 per cent drop in the fourth quarter last year.The “collapsing economy… prompted consumers and marketers alike to shut their wallets and conserve”, said Jon Swallen, senior vice president of research at TNS Media Intelligence. “While there are hopeful signs of general economic indicators bottoming out, the advertising sector still appears to be lagging behind.”Second-quarter spending is on a “comparable plane to recent months”, he added.Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, warned last week that the advertising market worsened in April.TNS’s figures show a steeper decline than rival Nielsen, which earlier this week reported a first-quarter decline of 12 per cent in US ad spending.But Maurice Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Publicis, the French marketing group, this week called the bottom of the advertising market.“The fall of advertising expenditures should be over,” Mr Lévy told shareholders at Tuesday’s annual meeting, adding that the second quarter would be the “toughest quarter, with an improvement coming in the second half of the year”.Local media has been hit hardest by cuts in spending from automotive, retail and local services advertisers, according to TNS. Spot TV fell 27.5 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, with local newspapers down 25.1 per cent and local radio 26.8 per cent lower.But national newspapers are faring even worse, down 28.5 per cent. Combined advertising spending in national media fell 8.5 per cent, with print suffering much more than networked television, down 4.2 per cent.The internet was the only medium to buck the downward trend. Online display advertising, which includes banners but excludes search ads, was up 8.2 per cent thanks to telecoms and travel spending.Unsurprisingly, automotive companies – still the largest category of US advertiser – made substantial cutbacks to their advertising, down 28.4 per cent to $2.3bn, with dealers almost halving their spending.General Motors spent $424.2m on advertising in the quarter, a cut of 19.1 per cent but “a smaller rate of decrease than most of its competitors”, TNS said.Financial services companies spent 18.1 per cent less.Procter & Gamble, the US’s largest advertiser, slashed its spending by 17.8 per cent to $674.1m, according to TNS. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson raised its spending by 28.9 per cent.Media companies themselves have responded to falling advertising by pulling back their own spending. Time Warner made the biggest cut of the 10 largest advertisers, taking 24.4 per cent out of its advertising budget, while News Corp spent 15.7 per cent less.
48;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2009-05-29T19:26:29Z;Hulu might charge viewers not to see ads;;Hulu, the fast-growing US online video service, is considering introducing a premium tier which would charge users in exchange for letting them watch television programmes and films without interruption from advertisements.Early discussions were disclosed by Jeff Zucker, chief executive of NBC Universal, who said on Thursday that the site was already ahead of its financial planning and would make positive cash flow “soon”, in spite of signs that much of its advertising inventory remains unsold.This would “of course” allow users to pay in order to avoid viewing ads, he said while attending the AllThingsD technology conference.Hulu was founded by NBCU and News Corp two years ago with backing from Providence Equity Partners. It signed up Walt Disney as a content partner and 25 per cent investor a month ago.Hulu’s plans come as many media owners are turning their backs on online strategies that depended only on advertising, as falling ad budgets begin to weigh even on once fast-growing digital categories such as online video.John Malone, chairman of the Liberty Media cable empire, highlighted the challenge of making money from online content at the same conference this week, saying: “Advertising may not do it. Hulu has ads, but they’re not significant.”Making people pay for content they have grown used to finding for free, however, was “a big intellectual jump”, Mr Malone cautioned.Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corp, also elaborated on recent comments that some of his newspapers would start charging for news online, telling Fox Business News: “You’re going to have to pay for your favourite newspaper online.”Less than a year after its March 2008 launch, Hulu became the second most-watched video site on the internet after YouTube, according to Nielsen Online, which calculated that total streams jumped 490 per cent from 63.2m in April 2008 to 373m in April 2009.Despite attracting commercials from advertisers ranging from American Express to Wal-Mart, however, it is airing several shows with minimal interruptions by advertising.Mr Zucker also backs TV Everywhere, an idea backed by Time Warner in which content on cable and satellite would be made available online and on mobile phones to pay-TV subscribers.
49;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2009-05-13T23:24:32Z;US drinkers change their tipple, says survey;;US drinkers have abandoned their previous enthusiasm for buying premium and ultra-premium vodkas and testing new and unusual wines, according to a new survey of consumer attitudes by the Nielsen Company.The survey of 5,000 US alcoholic drink consumers, published on Wednesday, showed that US drinking habits have tracked changes in the household products and food categories – with consumers now buying larger take-home packages to save money, seeking out special deals, and opting for cheaper, less premium brands.While ordering drinks at restaurants and bars, the survey found that 24 per cent of wine consumers are opting for cheaper bottles, while about a third of beer, wine and spirits consumers are ordering fewer drinks.Danny Brager, the Nielsen executive responsible for the survey, said it showed that “premiumisation” – the dominant trend in the spirits market until the third quarter of last year – had now “been zapped out of the market”.Consumers, he said, are “ordering draft beer instead of bottles, shifting from wine by the bottle to the glass and from calling for a specific brand name of liquor to letting the house decide”.He also noted that the survey showed a diminished interest in experimenting with new drinks.“One of the hallmarks of the wine category was that people wanted to experiment,” he said. “Now if you have a bad experience you feel like you have wasted your money, and no one wants to waste money at the moment.”Mike Keyes, head of North America region for Brown-Forman, said the US drinks company was also seeing “trading down” in wine sales at restaurants, and an overall shift to consumption at home. “Someone who might have bought a $50 or a $75 bottle is now buying a $35 bottle, and and someone who might have paid $35 may be be drinking wine by the glass,” he said.However, he pointed to continued strength of strong, established brands, such as Brown-Forman’s Jack Daniel’s whiskey, which sells for around $22 a bottle. Pernod-Ricard, which was one of the beneficiaries of “premiumisation” in vodka sales, has also reported continued strong US sales of its Jameson Irish whiskey.Mr Keyes said that “brands that are very, very strong and that are seen by consumers as very authentic are doing well.“Those brands that have not been around as long, the jury’s out as to whether they’ll have the longevity.”The Nielsen Company survey found that 23 per cent of respondents said they were focusing their spending on “tried and true” products, rather than risk trying something new.
50;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-12-05T23:30:25Z;Wine sales hit in sobering crisis;;Britain’s love affair with “plonk”, the cheap wine blamed for encouraging binge-drinking, is over: wine sales are dropping for the first time in decades as the economic downturn forces people to sober up.Once famed for its fondness for warm beer and sweet sherry, Britain has become a nation of oenophiles as cheap New World imports and supermarket own-label brands have made drinking wine an affordable habit.Brits fork out £4.8bn (€5.6bn, $7.1bn) annually on wine, compared with £3.3bn on beer and £3bn on spirits, and wine sales now account for more than a third of all alcohol purchases compared to just 24 per cent in 1992. But, as household incomes drop, people are cutting back on all kinds of alcohol purchases, wine in particular.Sales of still wine in supermarkets and other “off-trade” outlets such as off-licences have fallen 0.2 per cent by volume in the year to October, according to research group Nielsen, which tracks supermarket sales.“In living memory, the wine market has never ceased to grow,” said Stewart Blunt, Nielsen’s wine and spirits analyst.Demand for fine wines such as the Bordeaux 2005 vintage is also falling, according to Justerini & Brooks, the upmarket vintner in London’s St James’s.Total sales volumes of all kinds of alcohol dropped 6.8 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, with spirits down 8.2 per cent, wine down 10 per cent, and beer and cider each down 4.2 per cent, according to Bernstein Research.Additional reporting by John Willman

52;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-10-28T20:22:37Z;Consumers dig in for a lengthy downturn;;Plunging household incomes are causing dramatic changes in the way people around the world buy household goods and amuse themselves, with shifts towards cheaper items and in-home entertainment expected to last for years as consumers prepare for a long global recession.More than half the 26,000 people surveyed in 52 countries between late September and early October by research group Nielsen believe their countries will be in recession in 12 months’ time.The most pessimistic countries were Japan, Germany, Portugal and France.Nearly half of people surveyed said they were trying to save money by cutting back on “out of home” entertainment, such as going out to restaurants, and spending less money on new clothing, while more than one third were switching to cheaper grocery brands.The changes are hurting sales of “non-essential” products such as mobile phones, laptop computers and clothing.James Russo, vice-president of marketing at Nielsen, said these patterns of behaviour were likely to intensify as consumer confidence declined.“We’re seeing a fundamental shift in consumer behaviour,” Mr Russo said.In previous recessions, such as those that occurred in the US and Europe in the early years of the decade, consumers did not significantly change the way they bought goods and services.But with consumer confidence falling in 43 of the countries surveyed by Nielsen compared with last year (the Philippines, Brazil and Thailand are among the few countries where confidence has risen), people are changing the way they live their lives.Big shifts are starting to occur in Greece and Italy, where eating out has long been part of the culture: nearly three-quarters of Greeks say they are staying home more, and more than half of Italians are doing the same.More than half of the Japanese people surveyed, whose small flats make it difficult to cook, are buying fewer take-away meals.The people who are most optimistic about being out of recession within 12 months are the Indians, the Vietnamese, the Chinese and the Russians.Chris Morley, managing director of Nielsen China, said that while the country’s previously vibrant clothing industry was slowing down, sales of packaged food and household goods were rising, particularly in regional cities such as Chengdu and Chongqing.But in the UK, which is teetering on the edge of recession, there is one leading indicator that times are tough.Kimberly-Clark, the US owner of the Andrex toilet paper brand, said last week that sales of toilet paper were falling in Britain. “[That] is kind of unheard of,” the company said.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall
53;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-10-09T19:56:09Z;Consumers forced to rethink buying patterns;;"For much of the past century, there has been no better place to live comfortably than the US. In the world’s richest economy, air conditioners, microwaves and refrigerators that spit out ice cubes are common household goods, seen more as necessities than a luxuries.But as the country teeters on the edge of recession, life is becoming harder for the average American. With the purchasing power of the US dollar in sharp decline – it takes $2.66 to buy the same amount of goods that $1 would have bought in 1980 – and household incomes dropping, Americans are being forced to cut back on some of the products that have made life good. In western Europe, consumers are in a similar quandary, with France last week becoming the first large economy to acknowledge it had fallen into a recession.But in Asia, eastern Europe and South America, where many economies are still growing, life has been getting better for emerging middle class consumers, as more people than ever can afford to buy basic consumer products such as toothpaste, televisions and shampoo.“In developed markets [such as the US] consumers are still trying to preserve their buying power, which is all about trading down,” says Jeffrey Palma, an equity strategist at investment bank UBS. But in emerging markets the story is different,” he adds. “Incomes are rising…the phenomenon of trading up is still very much in place.”In the US, people are changing the way they shop as makers of branded household products and packaged foods put their prices up to recoup higher transportation and raw material costs. Last month, Jeff Rein, the chief executive of Walgreens, one of the largest US drug stores, noted that there had been a slowdown in the growth of the number of prescriptions being issued in the US.“We believe the biggest impact has been the very tough economy,” said Mr Rein, noting that a July survey by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners found that 22 per cent of Americans are reducing visits to the doctor to save money. Eleven per cent were found to be scaling back on medication.Sales of discretionary food and drink items, including bottled water and non-carbonated juices, and other drinks, are also dropping. Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said recently that consumers who might have previously left a screw top bottled drink unfinished, now finish it off. Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola’s largest bottler, has reported falling sales of larger, more expensive 20oz bottles of Coke that are a staple at petrol stations.But sales of cheap foods, such as cold, sliced meats as well as soups and frozen vegetables, are rising as people take thier lunches to work and look for cheap alternatives to fresh fruit and vegetables.US consumers are consolidating shopping trips to save money and spending more time at big stores that sell lots of different products at relatively cheap prices. These include: Wal-Mart, the low-cost chain; Costco and BJs, so-called “club” stores that charge membership fees; and discount chains, such as Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Consumers are also buying more so-called “own brand” goods.In Europe, consumers are cutting back on grocery purchases in all countries except Denmark and Norway, according to research group Nielsen, which tracks supermarket sales. “The second quarter revealed a clear and present pullback in consumer consumption,” the group says.To stop consumers “trading down” to cheaper own-label products, companies have begun making cheaper versions of their core products. In France, dairy group Danone has recently put a new kind of yoghurt into supermarkets. Labelled the “Eco Pack”, shoppers get six yoghurts for one euro. The yoghurt tubs weigh 115g each, compared with the 125g tubs the company usually makes, and Danone has also used less packaging, launched fewer flavours and spent less on marketing to keep the price down.But while companies are having a tough time making money in the US and western Europe, doing business in emerging markets has been getting easier. Whereas inflation is rising faster than wages in western markets, in emerging markets it’s the other way around. “In most emerging markets consumers are seeing increases in their real purchasing power, despite higher rates of inflation,” Clayton Daley, Procter & Gamble’s chief financial officer, told an investment conference last month .P&G, like other multinational western consumer goods companies, has been able over the past year to use strong demand in emerging markets to offset slowing sales in the US and Europe. In 2001, P&G’s emerging market sales were some $8bn annually. Today, they are $25bn, and the fastest-growing part of the company’s business.However, there are some initial signs that consumers in India, China, Russia and Brazil will not be immune to events unfolding in the US and Europe.At the end of September, Pepsi Bottling Group, which bottles and distributes PepsiCo products, was one of the first US companies to point to signs of the slowdown in the developing world spreading – as it blamed macroeconomic issues for a slump in sales over the summer in both Russia and Mexico.In Russia, Eric Foss, Pepsi Bottling Group CEO, cited “some near-term uncertainty and financial market volatility” that had led to the soft drinks market’s annual growth slowing to the range of 3 to 4 per cent, down from the low double digit growth rates seen previously. But he stressed the company’s belief that Russia “remains an attractive place for PBG to play over time”.In China and India, which have lower levels of income per head than Brazil and Russia, a big swing to upmarket brands has yet to happen outside of the countries’ biggest cities. But economists are confident it will.India has a lower gross domestic product per capita than Russia, Brazil or China, with less than 20 per cent of homes owning a microwave, refrigerator or washing machine compared with more than 50 per cent in China and nearly 100 per cent in Russia.But with India on track to have more people than any other country in the world by 2030, and incomes rising, consumption is expected to rise at faster rates than other countries.Meanwhile in China, companies say there is plenty of room for growth. Although people still spend just one-thirtieth the amount of money per head on P&G’s products than they do in the US, the time will come when the amount of money they spend will be the same, according to Bob McDonald, P&G’s chief operating officer. “It’s irrefutable.”"
54;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-09-21T22:31:02Z;Advertising hit by jitters over spending cuts;;"Madison Avenue could be forgiven for indulging in nostalgia when Jon Hamm, star of AMC’s Mad Men television series, appears at a Yahoo-sponsored event this week to remind the US advertising industry of its 1960s heyday.Six rock bands made up of advertising executives will still battle it out on Wednesday, but the usual festive mood of the annual Advertising Week gathering in New York has been overshadowed by the financial crisis rocking Wall Street and Washington.In direct terms, “the recent frenzy in the financial markets is mostly a distraction”, says Jon Swallen, senior vice-president of research at TNS Media Intelligence. Financial advertising represents only 6 per cent of the estimated $150bn in US advertising spending this year.But the fallout from a collapse in the mortgage and lending markets could shake fragile consumer confidence further.Mr Swallen says; “The events on Wall Street don’t ease consumer anxiety. Unemployment is still rising. There’s still a lot of nervousness on the part of consumers to spend money. The snapshot right now is not encouraging.”Bruce Goerlich, Zenith Optimedia’s head of US research, forecast in June that ad spending would rise by 3.4 per cent in 2008, but says he will cut expectations when he updates the figures in early October.He says: “I think [recent market turmoil] will create uncertainty and will have an impact on consumer confidence”.Others have already downgraded, and the picture could get much worse. Charles Rutman, North America chief executive of MPG, the Havas-owned media planning agency, reckons US ad spending could fall 5 per cent next year if conditions do not improve.“Forget about last week for a minute. Overall the economy is not healthy. Consumer confidence is really very low . . . People tend to postpone purchases that they otherwise would have made sooner.”Marketers are already adjusting to this new sombre view. Despite an 8.1 per cent gain in cable advertising spending, overall spending fell 1.4 per cent during the first half of 2008, according to Nielsen, dragged lower by declines in newspaper, network television and internet display advertising.However, such data did not stop a procession of US media executives saying last week they saw the crisis having minimal impact on their businesses other than making access to capital trickier.All acknowledged that local television and newspaper ad sales were suffering.Jeffrey Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, told investors at a Goldman Sachs media investors conference last week: “The economy is the biggest strategic question in everyone’s mind,“But it hasn’t had a big effect on Time Warner’s earnings, revenue and growth.”Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, said: “As people stop going out, guess what they’re going to consume – network television”.Jason Gardner, chief executive of global music at Live Nation, the concert promoter, even disputed the idea that people would stop going out. “Gas prices can go up, the economy can slow, but you still say, ‘You know what, I’m taking my wife to see Elton John’.”Such statements have done little to mask the gloomier view among marketing executives. “Everyone’s going to put on a pretty face,” says MPG chief operating officer Steve Lanzano. “[But] everyone’s real nervous about 2009.”"
55;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-08-20T21:29:02Z;Fox News chairman gets $4.5m bonus;;Roger Ailes received shares worth almost $4.5m for last October’s launch of the Fox Business Network, News Corp’s much-hyped bid to take on CNBC, according to a proxy filing by the media group.The channel’s poor early ratings may mean, however, that it will be some time before the Fox News Channel chairman can claim a second all-share bonus, due “when the fair market value of the Fox Business Network equals or exceeds two times its cost”.The Washington Post last month reported that The Nielsen Company had found that the new channel was averaging just 8,000 viewers during daytime hours, when business viewers are supposed to tune in from their desks, and 20,000 viewers in prime time.The media measurement group has not published its data for the Fox Business Network, as the new channel’s ratings are currently below its minimum reporting standards.Although the reported figures showed an increase from an early daytime audience of just 6,000, they contrasted with an average 233,000-strong audience at CNBC between June and August this year.News Corp has not released ratings figures but said this month that start-up costs for Fox Business Network and the Big Ten Network, a US sports channel, amounted to $200m.The award for Mr Ailes, who initially appeared half-hearted about the new channel but later told its staff he expected a revolution in business news, lifted his total compensation from $10.9m to $19.9m.The package for Rupert Murdoch, News Corp’s chairman, slipped from $32.1m to $27.6m in the same year, as accounting changes affected the value of his pension.Wendi Murdoch, Mr Murdoch’s wife, was paid $100,000 for advising the company as it sought to take its MySpace social networking site into China. She also joined other MySpace China executives in being granted options over 2.5 per cent of the shares of MySpace China.The filing set out that James Murdoch, the heir presumptive to the News Corp empire, could earn annual bonuses of almost $16m on top of the €2.3m ($3.4m) salary he was granted for taking responsibility of News Corp’s European and Asian assets.The former British Sky Broadcasting chief executive received $11m in salary, bonuses and other compensation in the six months after taking his new role in December.News Corp also disclosed that it had responded to shareholder calls to scrap its classified board structure, which was seen as a take-over defence as it allowed only part of the board to be replaced each year.Following the deal to exchange Liberty Media’s 16 per cent stake in News Corp for cash and assets including 41 per cent of DirecTV, News Corp said the risk of a takeover had been “significantly reduced”.
56;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-05-14T18:24:50Z;Nielsen steps back from move on TNS-GfK merger;;The Nielsen Company played down its interest in breaking up the agreed merger between two rival market research groups, Taylor Nelson Sofres and GfK.The move boosts TNS’s chances of fending off a rival approach from WPP, Sir Martin Sorrell’s advertising and marketing group.A Nielsen bid for GfK could have strengthened the hand of WPP, which owns the Kantar market research business and has seen two approaches to TNS turned down in the past two weeks.Nielsen, which was called VNU when it was taken over by six private equity groups for €7.6bn in 2006, had been reported to be considering an offer for GfK, the German group.However, David Calhoun, Nielsen’s chief executive, said on Wednesday that the strengths GfK and TNS had in consumer panels and customised research were not in the “sweet spot” of his strategy.“Consolidation in and of itself I don’t think is a particularly attractive prospect for us,” he said.The combination of GfK and TNS would create the world’s second-biggest research group after Nielsen, but Mr Calhoun said he did not expect it to change the competitive landscape much. TNS and GfK are both better positioned in Europe than in the US and developing markets, where Nielsen has focused its efforts.Last month’s $225m (£116m) purchase of IAG Research, which measures consumer engagement with television shows and commercials, was “the last acquisition I feel compelled to do” to achieve the “One Nielsen” strategy, he added.Shares in TNS rose 9½p to 255½p and WPP slipped 13½p to 627p as investors reacted to Tuesday’s after-hours news that a new cash-and-stock approach worth 241½p had been rejected by TNS’ board as “substantially [undervaluing] the company even on a standalone basis”.Investec yesterday argued that TNS-GfK would have to offer at least £63m of savings to justify a valuation above 263p, the “point of indifference” above which investors would look more favourably on a WPP offer.“The conundrum remains whether the combined group can generate what look to be very punchy savings, but at the same time not materially bite into GfK’s German workforce,” Investec said, noting that GfK Verein, the German group’s largest shareholder, could find heavy job losses “unpalatable”.Citigroup said the chances of the TNS-GfK deal going ahead had improved, adding that it saw only a 15 per cent chance of a WPP deal, which would have to be priced at 250p to 260p “to be even vaguely competitive”.

58;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-05-05T19:03:16Z;Market research industry faces shake-up;;"Rivals have predicted a merger between Taylor Nelson Sofres and GfK for years. But now one has been proposed, it has set off a series of moves that could consolidate the fragmented market research industry in unexpected ways.As the number-three and number-five participants scrambled to put together deal documents showing they expect far higher savings from the combination than analysts had thought, competitors were running their own numbers.The battle will determine who captures one of the fastest-growing corners of the marketing services sector at a time when new technology, demanding clients and a slowing economy are highlighting the benefits of scale.WPP, headed by Sir Martin Sorrell and owner of the Kantar research business, showed its hand first, proposing a £948m counter-offer for TNS. The approach was swiftly rejected, leaving WPP to protest at the UK group’s “cavalier” approach and refusal to respond to an earlier proposal for a nil-premium combination of Kantar and TNS.The Nielsen Company, the industry leader that has rebounded under new management since the former VNU was taken private in 2006, has appointed Morgan Stanley to examine a possible counter-bid for GfK.The chance of knock-on deal activity also lifted shares in Ipsos, a French rival, by 4 per cent and changed analysts’ assumptions on other possible transactions in the sector.WPP’s move signalled that Sir Martin’s interest has moved on from Synovate, the research business he expected to fall out of Aegis should the UK group succumb to Vincent Bolloré, the chairman of Havas.If WPP were to buy TNS, it could leave Mr Bolloré without an obvious buyer for Synovate, changing the calculations on any deal with Aegis. Aegis, in turn, hinted it could play a role, saying it would “watch developments with interest”.Although a representative said Synovate had no need for a significant merger or acquisition, she added: “The market research industry is still fragmented, with opportunities for further consolidation, as the events of the last week have shown.”That fragmentation is one factor driving the current deal activity. The top-10 companies’ share of the market improved from 43 per cent to 57 per cent between 2002 and 2006, according to Esomar, the research industry body, but clients’ demands for global scale and lower prices is also rising.According to Louise Garnett of Outsell, the market research industry’s appeal stems from the fact it has sustained a 5-6 per cent organic growth rate, as slowing growth in big economies threatens traditional advertising billings.Increasingly, according to one industry chief executive, “clients won’t make investments in advertising or online [marketing] unless they have a statistical or quantifiable justification for so doing”.Such data has become easier for clients to afford as technology transforms the industry. As online surveys replace clipboards and cold calls, customers are pushing for cost savings to be passed on. Online surveys, which cost about three-quarters as much as similar polls
conducted by telephone, accounted for 13 per cent of the $24.6bn (£12.5bn) market, Esomar estimates.Established groups are grappling with debates about the accuracy of internet surveys, the rise of online-focused boutiques such as YouGov, Research Now and Toluna, and rising interest in how social networks can be used to gauge consumer tastes.However, the increasing mechanisation of research means the industry’s big operators can more easily find economies of scale. The ease with which researchers can combine online panels to improve the sample size with little additional cost is the source of much of the expected synergy benefits in the TNS-GfK merger.When the deal was announced, analysts estimated those savings would amount to £30m-£45m. However, according to a leaked document reported in the German press, GfK and TNS are looking for about £80m in savings.That benefit is expected to form the basis of TNS’s argument to shareholders that they support a combination with GfK, rather than WPP’s proposed cash-and-share offer, worth 230p. TNS shares ended the week at 215p.According to Ms Garnett of Outsell, however, “if I were to put two companies together that would take out bigger savings, it would be TNS and Kantar. To me, that would be the better play.”TNS is still digesting smaller acquisitions such as its purchase of Compete, which analyses web traffic, she added, and has no experience of integrating a deal as large as GfK.With earnings before interest and tax of £122m on revenues of £905m last year, Kantar can boast higher margins than TNS, which reported earnings before interest and tax of £112m on turnover of £1.07bn.To stick to its preferred deal, TNS needs to persuade shareholders it can create greater long-term value, tackle regulatory questions over the reduction of competition in television audience monitoring, and deal with cutting employees in GfK’s German home market.But a stumble at any of the three hurdles could give rivals their chance to reshape the industry."
59;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-05-04T19:10:38Z;TNS rebuffs offer from WPP;;Taylor Nelson Sofres, the market research group that last week announced an agreed nil-premium merger with Germany’s GfK, has rejected an unsolicited £948m ($1.9bn) bid from WPP, the world’s second-biggest marketing group.The part-cash, part-share offer, received on Saturday, valued each TNS share at 230p, based on WPP’s closing price on Friday.TNS shares ended the week at 215p, but had risen sharply after news of the tie-up with GfK leaked on Tuesday. The WPP offer represents a premium of 34.5 per cent to the TNS share price of 171p at the close of Monday’s trading.On Sunday, the TNS board unanimously rejected the bid as not in shareholders’ best interests. Donald Brydon, chairman said: “The board has no hesitation in rejecting this opportunistic proposal as it substantially undervalues the company even on a standalone basis.”Sir Martin Sorrell wanted to add TNS to WPP’s Kantar market research subsidiary to build up the group’s “measurable businesses” – one of his three strategic priorities.WPP said on Sunday: “We think the response is cavalier, given the proposal was made only a day or so ago and offered shareholders a significant premium.”The group added that it had received no response to its request for more information as a condition for the 230p offer that GfK has already been given.TNS said on Sunday it had rejected an unsolicited informal proposal from WPP to reverse Kantar into TNS, giving WPP control of the enlarged operation without paying a premium.The proposed “merger of equals” between TNS and GfK, which had long been in the planning, is also under threat from Nielsen, the market leader that has appointed Morgan Stanley to advise it on a rival bid for GfK.Industry insiders had predicted other bidders might emerge, questioning whether a TNS-GfK tie-up would create the greatest benefit for the shareholders of the two companies.Any counter-offer for GfK by Nielsen, owned by a consortium of private equity firms, would have to be friendly as 57 per cent of its shares are held by GfK-Verein, a non-profit organisation based in Nuremburg. GfK is the fourth-largest market research group, and TNS is number three behind IMS, a US healthcare specialist, and Nielsen is top.GfK-TNS, as the group would be called, would have its global head office in London, but retain a German head office in Nuremburg.The two companies forecast “substantial operating efficiencies and enhanced revenue opportunities” from the merger. However analysts have questioned the scope for staff savings, given the resistance to job cuts in Germany.The agreed merger would hand the top job to David Lowden, TNS chief executive. Klaus Wübbenhorst, the German group’s chief executive, would be come a non-executive director representing GfK-Verein.Donald Brydon, TNS chairman, and Hajo Riesenbeck, GfK’s chairman, would become co-chairmen, with Mr Brydon stepping down in Mr Riesenbeck’s favour in 2010.Following Tuesday’s announcement, GfK shares rose 7 per cent to €30, valuing the shares at €1.08bn. TNS is being advised by Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Cazenove.
60;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-03-06T02:54:50Z;Online video watching surges;;Watching and sharing videos have become some of the UK’s most popular online activities, with new figures showing that YouTube, the video website, has overtaken Wikipedia as the most visited social media website.Some 10.4m people visited YouTube in January, compared with 9.6m going to Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia, and 8.5m visitors to Facebook, the social networking website, according to figures from Nielsen Online.Visitors to YouTube are up by 56 per cent from last January and represent about a third of people using the internet in the UK. Facebook leapt from being the 18th most popular social media website last year to third place this year, with visitor numbers soaring 712 per cent.Video-sharing websites are enjoying a rise in popularity, with websites such as vidShadow, Veoh and Youku dominating the list of the fastest growing websites in the UK.Veoh, which carries everything from home videos to network broadcasts, grew by almost 600 per cent over the past year to reach 799,000 visitors in January. VidShadow, which allows amateur video producers to make money from sharing clips, has grown 639 per cent in the past two months.Alex Burmaster, internet analyst at Nielsen, said access to fast broadband internet services was prompting more people to watch videos online. About 85 per cent of UK internet connections are over broadband.Media companies such as the BBC and Channel 4 have also recently launched services allowing viewers to watch TV programmes over the internet. They have been promoting these services heavily, increasing the public’s awareness that they can watch videos online.Websites such as the BBC’s iPlayer are not classed as “social media” as, unlike YouTube, they show only professional content and do not allow people to upload their own material. But the marketing for these websites has had a beneficial effect on the online video sector as a whole.“It is not niche behaviour anymore,” Mr Burmaster said. “The internet has become a mainstream part of life and logging on is as natural as turning on the TV or opening a newspaper.”Creative types must face the music
61;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-02-27T19:51:34Z;Executives resist new medium;;Senior executives in the UK are failing to grasp the marketing potential of social networking sites, according to a study that could raise questions about the European expansion plans of Facebook, MySpace and Bebo.A poll of marketing executives in the US, Canada, France and the UK found that all believed social networking was a lasting phenomenon, but UK businesses had encountered far more resistance from their boards to investing in the medium.Just 18 per cent of the UK businesses questioned believed their brands must engage urgently with social media if they were to avoid falling behind the market.In the US the comparable figure was almost 50 per cent, said TNS Media Intelligence/Cymfony, which monitors brands’ reputations on blogs and social networks and compiled the study.The findings, to be released on Thursday, follow a Nielsen NetRatings report that traffic on Facebook’s website in the UK had fallen by 5 per cent, or 400,000 unique users, from December to January.Blake Chandlee, UK commercial director of Facebook, challenged the claim at an FT conference this week, saying its traffic from regular users was up 8 per cent in the UK.“It is surprising to see the UK lagging so far behind in terms of recognising the business potential for social media,” said Jim Nail, chief strategy and marketing officer of TNS Media Intelligence/Cymfony.The damage done to brands that ignored such sites was clear, he said, and would only increase as they accumulated more members. The UK marketing executives surveyed were almost twice as likely as those from other countries to admit that they were still “at a learning stage”, while most North American companies said they were at the “experimentation” stage. More than a third admitted a lack of skill among marketing teams was the greatest barrier to engaging with social media, Mr Nail said.“What we’ve seen in the past is the same sort of intrusive, interruptive forms of advertising that are in every other medium, as well as privacy-invading ways of using personal data to target those ads,” he said. “That kind of advertising doesn’t work on social media.”More advanced advertisers were moving from banner ads and creating profile pages to offering widgets and other branded tools that users can incorporate into their own profiles, Mr Nail said.Scare stories of advertisers finding their messages sitting alongside unpalatable content have played a part in making business nervous about the new medium, he added. “It’s an unknown world, so they dream up disaster scenarios they could potentially be dealing with.”But he dismissed such threats as small, comparing social networks to local radio in the US, where “advertisers have no idea what shock jocks may say, but they don’t really care”.Another factor in the UK’s relative caution about the new medium was the fact that most social networks had originated in the US and only recently focused resources on the UK. Social advertising tools, such as Facebook’s controversial Beacon initiative, were also launched first in the US.Facebook appointed a UK commercial director, Mr Chandlee, only last October. According to MediaWeek, the number of advertisers its in-house sales team has signed up has grown ten-fold since the start of 2008.However, some advertisers privately admitted concerns about the Nielsen figures, which showed smaller month-on-month falls for MySpace and Bebo, saying any repeat of the pattern in February could make them more cautious still about the opportunity such sites represent.
62;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2008-02-21T21:23:18Z;Rivals claim that sale is ‘a year too late’;;"Analysts and rivals have been pushing Reed Elsevier to sell its magazines business for years, but they were surprised when it did so in a market where investors are bearish about advertising and £1bn-plus bids are hard to fund.“Clearly today is not an optimum time to be divesting this business and it may be that we have to be patient,” Sir Crispin Davis, Reed’s chief executive, admitted.Competitors were more blunt. “They’re probably a year too late for this,” one said.Analysts believe the assets will fetch eight times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, two-thirds of the multiple paid for Emap’s similar business in late 2007.Sir Crispin has told his advisers at UBS to look at all options, including a demerger. They will have to find the least dilutive way of disposing of a portfolio that ranges from powerhouses to titles exposed to tough
sectors such as property.Interviews with several rivals suggested that there will be more interest in pieces of the portfolio than the whole division, which reported adjusted operating profit of £119m, up 10 per cent, in 2007.Among those expected to show interest are Informa of the UK; Apax, the private equity group that has invested in Incisive and Emap; and Veronis Suhler Stevenson, which yesterday bought Clarion Events.Other private equity-backed competitors such as Nielsen and Springer had been seen as likely to seek a sale or flotation in the next year, but could instead bulk up by buying Reed titles.Chuck Richard, lead analyst with Outsell, a market researcher, said the sale could be hampered by Reed retaining its exhibitions business. A rival, however, said that Reed would not prevent buyers from setting up related shows. “That’s quite interesting,” he said."
63;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2006-07-21T16:31:10Z;Apple’s iTunes spurs surge in podcasting;;Podcasts have grown significantly more popular since iTunes started listing the audio and video downloads last year, according to a report released this week by Nielsen Analytics.The study indicates that the growth of podcasts could have significant effects on advertising models and radio listener numbers in the near future, as web users turn away from traditional media for online news, entertainment and political commentary.The report, “The Economics of Podcasting”, found that more than 6 per cent of US adults, or nearly 9m web users, have downloaded at least one podcast in the last month. Of those, about 10 per cent are “heavy users”, downloading eight or more podcasts weekly. Most podcast listeners download between one and three shows per week.These findings, issued on Thursday, closely mirror another Nielsen report released July 12, which found that 6.6 per cent of the US adult online population, or 9.2m people, have downloaded at least one audio podcast in the last month. That study was conducted by Nielsen/NetRatings.About 60 per cent of the “regular” or “active” podcast downloaders - the vast majority of whom are men - fast forward through commercials in their podcasts, reflecting a trend seen in other media.Larry Gerbrandt, general manager and senior vice-president at Nielsen Analytics, said that “the onus is on the advertiser” to incorporate ads into podcasts through sponsorships or product placement.Radio companies will need to embrace podcasts as downloads continue to rise. The Nielsen revealed that 38 per cent of “active” podcasters say they now listen to the radio less often than before beginning to download podcasts.“This is not the death knell for the industry,” Mr Gerbrandt said of radio, but warned that as more cars became iPod-compatible and therefore podcast-compatible, radio would face even greater competition.At his latest count, about three weeks ago, iTunes, created and owned by Apple Computer, listed 60,000 different podcasts.
64;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2006-05-29T22:54:48Z;Mysteries of adolescence infuse social internet sites;;"Social networking sites are beginning to suffer the same growing pains as the teenagers fuelling their expansion – they have little idea what the future holds and the grown-ups, as in advertisers, analysts and old media, are not really sure how to relate to them.They are also growing up fast, in all kinds of unexpected places; their friends can be fickle and their activities can offend.News Corp’s MySpace is the hottest new kid on the block with 65m unique visitors last month. Although the comScore research firm still rates it third worldwide behind Yahoo’s Geocities and MSN Spaces with 116m and 101m visitors respectively, MySpace members grew 111 per cent over six months and the average minutes each one spends on MySpace per month is 184, compared to just four minutes for Geocities.On social networking sites, members spend most of their time loading their own personal web pages with photos, video, blog links and their musical tastes and then checking out those of friends and leaving messages.“These sites are the reality TV of the internet, it’s incredibly cheap to produce the content,” says Jon Gibs, senior director of media at the Nielsen/Net Ratings research firm.Advertisers and media companies have muscled in by mimicking the techniques used by musicians to promote themselves successfully on MySpace with their own personal pages. Buzz on brands and forthcoming movies can be generated within the MySpace ecosystem.But behavioural patterns of usage suggest social networks are hard to get a handle on and the jury is still out on whether MySpace is phenomenon or fad.“We do see it as a very fast changing space and we’ve discovered that there’s a lot of traffic moving from one social networking site to another,” says Heather Hopkins, Director of Research at Hitwise UK.Hitwise sees users transferring from MySpace to Bebo, which is set to overtake MySpace as the most popular networking site in the UK in the next few weeks.“People are moving among the sites and using them for different things. It’s not displacing the other site but I do see the attention of the audience fragmenting,” she says.The unpredictable nature of how the sites propagate and catch on in certain geographic areas is also perplexing. Bebo is the leading site in New Zealand, Multiply is big in the Philippines and Google’s Orkut has a fanatical following in Brazil.Users also link outside of their networks to sites such as YouTube, where they can store personal videos, and Flickr, the photo-sharing site. Such tool providers claim a more stable user base – their functions will still be needed even if users switch social networks.But Jon Gibs disagrees: “I’m not sold on the idea that the future of online video is YouTube. The tool set for me is interchangeable if a new service comes along and is built on a more stable platform.”The young demographic of users also suggests allegiances will be weak – as teenagers move from school to college and then the world of work, their friends will change and so will their social networks.Maha Ibrahim, a partner at venture capital firm Canaan Partners, says: “Next-generation social networking companies are trying to build communities based on strata of interests instead of just generic communities like MySpace. They’re trying to stratify the site even further into people who are into sports, people who are into dogs.”This should promote a more stable membership as should focusing on age groups whose internet use is less promiscuous. Martha Stewart, the US home-maker guru, has announced plans for a social network aimed at women; WebBiographies has launched, targeting older audiences; and Multiply is family oriented.“MySpace encourages midnight personas and has taken on its own persona of being for teens but how sustainable is that? – fashions come and go,” says Peter Pezaris, Multiply founder.Social networking sites are also struggling to come to terms with controlling content that might offend. Google last week shut down some Orkut communities that the Brazilian government said had advocated violence and human rights violations. Meanwhile, Xanga introduced a rating system for member’s sites similar to that adopted by the movie industry.Tool providers have also been forced to act.“We give the community tools to flag the content and when we see content that violates our guidelines we remove it within minutes,” says Julie Supan, director of marketing for YouTube.Overall, social networking is on a curve that makes its future trajectory hard to predict.“There’s too much trend growth to know, the pie is growing so fast,” says Bob Ivins, managing director of comScore Europe.Ben Schachter, internet analyst at UBS, warns: “There have been plenty of internet sites with strong growth that have subsequently deflated again. Will MySpace, in a year’s time, be like Friendster [and lose momentum] or will it be like Yahoo?”

65;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2006-01-04T23:07:34Z;Digital sales surge fails to offset album decline;;The surge in digital music sales last year was not enough to offset a continued decline in overall album sales, according to figures released on Wednesday, highlighting the precarious state of the record industry and the risks associated with switches to digital distribution.Over the last 12 months, sales of digital tracks rose 194 per cent to 352m units, according to Nielsen Soundscan, the entertainment consultancy. Digital album sales also posted robust growth, gaining 66 per cent to 16.2m units.In spite of those increases, however, overall album sales slipped by 3.9 per cent in 2005, owing to a drop in sales of CDs.The year-end results are another sign of the challenges facing the music industry. A slight rise in album sales in 2004 raised hopes among industry executives after a five-year slide, brought about by high prices and an epidemic of piracy.Strong fourth-quarter results at Warner Music and EMI – both buoyed by digital sales – had also stirred optimism that the industry had found its footing in a new landscape. Digital distribution did set some records in 2005, with digital track sales reaching 19.9m units sold, the most ever and marking the first time another format has exceeded album sales, which totalled 16.8m last year. The figures show only the number of units sold, not the dollar value of units.The Nielsen figures showed a drop in every music genre except Latin, where album sales rose 12.6 per cent.The four largest music companies maintained their relative market positions last year. Universal Music maintained the top slot with 31.7 per cent of total album sales, up from 29.6 per cent last year. Sony BMG was second with 25.6 per cent, down from 28.5 per cent in 2004. Warner Music and EMI were roughly steady in terms of share of total album sales, at 15 per cent and 9.5 per cent respectively.
66;NLSN;Nielsen Holdings Plc;2005-12-26T20:39:13Z;Online gift auctions temper post-Christmas blues;;"From an economic point of view, gift giving ranks as one of the most inefficient of human activities. The reason is simple: most gifts are not quite what we would choose ourselves – so we value them at less than their purchase price.But now the internet has a solution for the wanton destruction of human wealth that takes place every Christmas: online auctions. People have been recovering value from an unwanted gift since the dawn of time by re-wrapping it and giving it to somebody else – who probably also does not want it. But selling gifts online is far more efficient: the goods end up with someone who values them; and the original recipient gets cash to buy the thing he wanted in the first place.Over the next few weeks, thousands – and possibly millions – of people will be selling off their unwanted Christmas presents online – and buying things they really want instead.Ebay, the world’s largest auction site with 168m registered users, says the post-Christmas season is traditionally busy. A survey released by the company last week found that over half of Americans surveyed say they “re-gift” presents they do not like, will not use, or do not fit. A large number – 11 per cent – say they have previously sold an unwanted gift online. In the 25-34 age group, that number doubles to 22 per cent.In the UK, a recent Nielsen/Net Ratings survey says 15 per cent of UK online shoppers plan to sell unwanted Christmas gifts online, and a further 35 per cent are considering it – with women more likely to do so than men.Re-gifting online is just part of a much larger cultural phenomenon, says Daniel Nissanoff, whose book FutureShop: How the New Auction Culture Will Revolutionize the Way We Buy, Sell and Get the Things We Really Want, will be published in January. He says Americans are increasingly unlocking the value stored in their possessions by trading them in secondary markets – and that has important implications for the makers of new goods.Trading secondhand goods – on Ebay, Amazon.com, Craigslist and other online sites, as well as in charity and thrift shops, car boot sales, and yard sales – has risen sharply in recent years. Ebay itself – where many of the goods are actually new, but sold outside primary retail channels – now has 168m registered members. Ebay says 750,000people use the site as a primary or secondary source of income.Mr Nissanoff predicts that, as online secondary markets grow in popularity and liquidity, they will transform the US from an “accumulation nation” to an “auction culture”. He runs a secondary market for luxury goods at portero.com, and says this is happening already. “We are beginning to accept, and will soon vigorously adopt a new lifestyle, one predicated on the norm of temporary ownership and marked by the continuous replacement of our personal possessions,” he writes.In much the same way that many Americans own their cars only temporarily – through popular leasing arrangements – they will also buy and use electronic, fashion and other retail goods, and then resell them once they tire of them, outgrow them, or covet a newer version, he adds.That, in turn, will motivate consumers to choose higher-end items, with better resale value – much as they now do with cars, where there is a highly liquid secondary market. And that will give manufacturers an incentive to design goods that last. “We will be able to buy more of the things we really want, because we’ll also be regularly selling off the things we no longer want or need,” he says.Austan Goolsbee, economics professor at the University of Chicago, and an avid trader of high-end used racing bikes on Ebay, says: “There is something to the notion that new prices have the potential to start rising because people start saying, now there is a well-functioning used market on Ebay so I am willing to pay more for the new thing.” For goods like that, he says – where the market in most physical locations will be too thin to sustain a store – “Ebay is where all the transactions take place”. And that could drive up prices for new bikes, he says, noting he is far more likely to pay a higher price for a new bike if he knows he can recoup 30 per cent of the purchase price at resale.Mr Nissanoff says the recent pre-holiday period provided a perfect example of how the concept of temporary ownership might operate. “During the last week of November, after the release of Microsoft’s Xbox 360, individuals traded approximately 30,000 Xbox units on eBay for almost $25m” – an average of twice the retail price. “Imagine – you can buy the game console, enjoy it through the holidays and then sell it at a profit.”But the “auction culture” will not really get off the ground, he says, until there is a better balance between buyers and sellers (he estimates that only 5 per cent of Ebay users are sellers). And more sellers will emerge only when there is a better infrastructure to facilitate selling: what he calls “drop shops” that charge a fee to handle such auctions.The best thing about trading gifts, say Ebay fans, is that you can sell one without offending the giver. “You can do it with pretty good confidence that you are [selling] to someone who isn’t anywhere near your social circle,” says Ebay."
