Together the two companies will become one of the key managers of US government-sponsored healthcare plans, including Medicaid and Medicare, for 22m people across the 50 states.Michael Neidorff, chief executive of Centene, said there was a lot of “headline volatility” in the market, with President Donald Trump’s tweets sometimes clashing with his administration’s official healthcare policies. “Personally, I’ve found that is sometimes the best time to take advantage of the situation,” he said. But he said he was confident that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, would survive, with four out of five members of Centene’s ACA plans renewing each year.Earlier this week, the US Department of Justice backed a court ruling that declared “unconstitutional” the ACA’s requirement that every individual has health insurance. But Mr Neidorff said he believed the ruling would be struck down by a higher court.The deal will bolster Centene’s presence in the Medicare Advantage market, an expanded programme for older people that offers extra benefits. “I think insurance is a law of large numbers and so the consolidation becomes critical,” he said.The transaction follows a string of mergers involving drugmakers, healthcare insurers and pharmacies. Those deals have put pressure on other segments of the health industry, such as hospitals and managed care groups, to consolidate so that they can better negotiate to reduce the costs of care. This year, a record $181bn has been spent on healthcare deals. However, the total number of transactions has declined by about a third, according to Refinitiv data. The reasons for this contrasting trend is that dealmaking in the sector has been dominated by large transactions, including Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $90bn acquisition of Celgene, the $21bn sale of General Electric’s biotech unit to rival Danaher and Eli Lilly’s $8bn takeover of cancer treatment specialist Loxo Oncology. It is not clear whether all this consolidation in healthcare will ultimately improve care for patients, and regulators and US politicians concerned about the rising cost of health will be likely to scrutinise transactions in the sector ahead of the 2020 election. Healthcare is quickly rising to the top of the agenda in Washington as the White House takes aim at the Affordable Care Act, which requires most Americans to have health insurance.Ana Gupte, an analyst at SVB Leerink, said in a note that the deal would help Centene diversify away from Obamacare.She added that the combined company might have to divest assets in some states — such as Florida and Georgia — where it will hold more than 50 per cent of the market.“The combined company will enhance its already robust efforts to address the social determinants of health such as food insecurity, housing instability, homelessness, unemployment, lack of access to transportation and other non-medical barriers to health,” the companies said in a statement. The cash-and-stock transaction values WellCare’s stock at $305.39, a 32 per cent premium based on the company’s closing stock price on March 26. Under the terms of the deal, WellCare shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 3.38 shares of Centene common stock and $120 in cash for each of their shares.“With the addition of WellCare, we expect to bolster and diversify our product offerings, increase our scale and have access to new markets, which will in turn enable us to continue investing in technology and better serve members with innovative programmes designed to meet their needs,” said Mr Neidorff.Centene said it had secured financing for the deal, with Barclays committed to lend $8.35bn to fund the takeover. The companies expect to complete the deal in the first half of 2020 after obtaining regulatory approvals.

The stock has since trimmed some of that gain but is trading 0.9 per cent higher at $91.54.Other stocks also enjoyed a similar reversal of fortunes. Shares of health insurer Anthem and Humana both erased a 1.5 per cent decline to advance as much as 1.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively before falling again to trade marginally lower.Rival insurer Aetna and UnitedHealth swung from losses of 2 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively to trade 1.1 per cent and 0.4 per cent higher.

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
